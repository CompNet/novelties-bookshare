Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
among O
the O
earliest O
of O
those O
who O
waited O
on O
Mr. O
Bingley O
. O
He O
had O
always O
intended O
to O
visit O
him O
, O
though O
to O
the O
last O
always O
assuring O
his O
wife O
that O
he O
should O
not O
go O
; O
and O
till O
the O
evening O
after O
the O
visit O
was O
paid O
, O
she O
had O
no O
knowledge O
of O
it O
. O
It O
was O
then O
disclosed O
in O
the O
following O
manner O
. O
Observing O
his O
second O
daughter O
employed O
in O
trimming O
a O
hat O
, O
he O
suddenly O
addressed O
her O
with O
, O
" O
I O
hope O
Mr. O
Bingley O
will O
like O
it O
Lizzy O
. O
" O
" O
We O
are O
not O
in O
a O
way O
to O
know O
what O
Mr. O
Bingley O
likes O
, O
" O
said O
her O
mother O
resentfully O
, O
" O
since O
we O
are O
not O
to O
visit O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
forget O
, O
mama O
, O
" O
said O
Eli- O
zabeth O
, O
" O
that O
we O
shall O
meet O
him O
at O
the O
assemblies O
, O
and O
that O
Mrs. O
Long O
has O
promised O
to O
introduce O
him O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
Mrs. O
Long O
will O
do O
any O
such O
thing O
. O
She O
has O
two O
neices O
of O
her O
own O
. O
She O
is O
a O
selfish O
, O
hypocritical O
woman O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
opinion O
of O
her O
. O
" O
" O
No O
more O
have O
I O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
; O
" O
and O
I O
am O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
you O
do O
not O
depend O
on O
her O
serving O
you O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
deigned O
not O
to O
make O
any O
reply O
; O
but O
unable O
to O
contain O
herself O
, O
began O
scolding O
one O
of O
her O
daughters O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
keep O
coughing O
so O
, O
Kitty O
, O
for O
heaven O
's O
sake O
! O
Have O
a O
little O
compassion O
on O
my O
nerves O
. O
You O
tear O
them O
to O
pieces O
. O
" O
" O
Kitty O
has O
no O
discretion O
in O
her O
coughs O
, O
" O
said O
her O
father O
; O
" O
she O
times O
them O
ill O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
cough O
for O
my O
own O
amusement O
, O
" O
replied O
Kitty O
fretfully O
. O
" O
When O
is O
your O
next O
ball O
to O
be O
, O
Lizzy O
? O
" O
" O
To-morrow O
fortnight O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
so O
it O
is O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
and O
Mrs. O
Long O
does O
not O
come O
back O
till O
the O
day O
before O
; O
so O
, O
it O
will O
be O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
introduce O
him O
, O
for O
she O
will O
not O
know O
him O
herself O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
may O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
your O
friend O
, O
and O
introduce O
Mr. O
Bingley O
to O
her O
. O
" O
" O
Impossible O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
impossible O
, O
when O
I O
am O
not O
acquainted O
with O
him O
myself O
; O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
teazing O
? O
" O
" O
I O
honour O
your O
circumspection O
. O
A O
fortnight O
's O
acquaintance O
is O
certainly O
very O
little O
. O
One O
can O
not O
know O
what O
a O
man O
really O
is O
by O
the O
end O
of O
a O
fortnight O
. O
But O
if O
we O
do O
not O
venture O
, O
somebody O
else O
will O
; O
and O
after O
all O
, O
Mrs. O
Long O
and O
her O
neices O
must O
stand O
their O
chance O
; O
and O
therefore O
, O
as O
she O
will O
think O
it O
an O
act O
of O
kindness O
, O
if O
you O
decline O
the O
office O
, O
I O
will O
take O
it O
on O
myself O
. O
" O
The O
girls O
stared O
at O
their O
father O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
said O
only O
, O
" O
Nonsense O
, O
nonsense O
! O
" O
" O
What O
can O
be O
the O
meaning O
of O
that O
emphatic O
exclamation O
? O
" O
cried O
he O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
consider O
the O
forms O
of O
introduction O
, O
and O
the O
stress O
that O
is O
laid O
on O
them O
, O
as O
nonsense O
? O
I O
can O
not O
quite O
agree O
with O
you O
there O
. O
What O
say O
you O
, O
Mary O
? O
for O
you O
are O
a O
young O
lady O
of O
deep O
reflection O
I O
know O
, O
and O
read O
great O
books O
, O
and O
make O
extracts O
. O
" O
Mary O
wished O
to O
say O
something O
very O
sensible O
, O
but O
knew O
not O
how O
. O
" O
While O
Mary O
is O
adjusting O
her O
ideas O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
let O
us O
return O
to O
Mr O
. O
Bingley O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
sick O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
" O
cried O
his O
wife O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
; O
but O
why O
did O
not O
you O
tell O
me O
so O
before O
? O
If O
I O
had O
known O
as O
much O
this O
morning O
, O
I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
called O
on O
him O
. O
It O
is O
very O
unlucky O
; O
but O
as O
I O
have O
actually O
paid O
the O
visit O
, O
we O
can O
not O
escape O
the O
acquaintance O
now O
. O
" O
The O
astonishment O
of O
the O
ladies O
was O
just O
what O
he O
wished O
; O
that O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
perhaps O
surpassing O
the O
rest O
; O
though O
when O
the O
first O
tumult O
of O
joy O
was O
over O
, O
she O
began O
to O
declare O
that O
it O
was O
what O
she O
had O
expected O
all O
the O
while O
. O
" O
How O
good O
it O
was O
in O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet O
? O
But O
I O
knew O
I O
should O
persuade O
you O
at O
last O
. O
I O
was O
sure O
you O
loved O
your O
girls O
too O
well O
to O
neglect O
such O
an O
acquaintance O
. O
Well O
, O
how O
pleased O
I O
am O
! O
and O
it O
is O
such O
a O
good O
joke O
, O
too O
, O
that O
you O
should O
have O
gone O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
never O
said O
a O
word O
about O
it O
till O
now O
. O
" O
" O
Now O
, O
Kitty O
, O
you O
may O
cough O
as O
much O
as O
you O
chuse O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
; O
and O
, O
as O
he O
spoke O
, O
he O
left O
the O
room O
, O
fatigued O
with O
the O
raptures O
of O
his O
wife O
. O
" O
What O
an O
excellent O
father O
you O
have O
, O
girls O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
when O
the O
door O
was O
shut O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
you O
will O
ever O
make O
him O
amends O
for O
his O
kindness O
; O
or O
me O
either O
, O
for O
that O
matter O
. O
At O
our O
time O
of O
life O
, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
pleasant O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
, O
to O
be O
making O
new O
acquaintance O
every O
day O
; O
but O
for O
your O
sakes O
, O
we O
would O
do O
any O
thing O
. O
Lydia O
, O
my O
love O
, O
though O
you O
are O
the O
youngest O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
Mr. O
Bingley O
will O
dance O
with O
you O
at O
the O
next O
ball O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
" O
said O
Lydia O
stoutly O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
; O
for O
though O
I O
am O
the O
youngest O
, O
I O
'm O
the O
tallest O
. O
" O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
was O
spent O
in O
conjecturing O
how O
soon O
he O
would O
return O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
visit O
, O
and O
determining O
when O
they O
should O
ask O
him O
to O
dinner O
. O
