Not O
all O
that O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
assistance O
of O
her O
five O
daughters O
, O
could O
ask O
on O
the O
subject O
was O
sufficient O
to O
draw O
from O
her O
husband O
any O
satisfactory O
description O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
. O
They O
attacked O
him O
in O
various O
ways O
; O
with O
barefaced O
questions O
, O
ingenious O
suppositions O
, O
and O
distant O
surmises O
; O
but O
he O
eluded O
the O
skill O
of O
them O
all O
; O
and O
they O
were O
at O
last O
obliged O
to O
accept O
the O
second-hand O
intelligence O
of O
their O
neighbour O
Lady O
Lucas O
. O
Her O
report O
was O
highly O
favourable O
. O
Sir O
William O
had O
been O
delighted O
with O
him O
. O
He O
was O
quite O
young O
, O
wonderfully O
handsome O
, O
extremely O
agreeable O
, O
and O
to O
crown O
the O
whole O
, O
he O
meant O
to O
be O
at O
the O
next O
assembly O
with O
a O
large O
party O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
delightful O
! O
To O
be O
fond O
of O
dancing O
was O
a O
certain O
step O
towards O
falling O
in O
love O
; O
and O
very O
lively O
hopes O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
heart O
were O
entertained O
. O
" O
If O
I O
can O
but O
see O
one O
of O
my O
daughters O
happily O
settled O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
" O
and O
all O
the O
others O
equally O
well O
married O
, O
I O
shall O
have O
nothing O
to O
wish O
for O
. O
" O
In O
a O
few O
days O
Mr. O
Bingley O
returned O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
visit O
, O
and O
sat O
about O
ten O
minutes O
with O
him O
in O
his O
library O
. O
He O
had O
entertained O
hopes O
of O
being O
admitted O
to O
a O
sight O
of O
the O
young O
ladies O
, O
of O
whose O
beauty O
he O
had O
heard O
much O
; O
but O
he O
saw O
only O
the O
father O
. O
The O
ladies O
were O
somewhat O
more O
fortunate O
, O
for O
they O
had O
the O
advantage O
of O
ascertaining O
from O
an O
upper O
window O
, O
that O
he O
wore O
a O
blue O
coat O
and O
rode O
a O
black O
horse O
. O
An O
invitation O
to O
dinner O
was O
soon O
afterwards O
dispatched O
; O
and O
already O
had O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
planned O
the O
courses O
that O
were O
to O
do O
credit O
to O
her O
housekeeping O
, O
when O
an O
answer O
arrived O
which O
deferred O
it O
all O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
was O
obliged O
to O
be O
in O
town O
the O
following O
day O
, O
and O
consequently O
unable O
to O
accept O
the O
honour O
of O
their O
invitation O
, O
& O
c. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
quite O
disconcerted O
. O
She O
could O
not O
imagine O
what O
business O
he O
could O
have O
in O
town O
so O
soon O
after O
his O
arrival O
in O
Hertfordshire O
; O
and O
she O
began O
to O
fear O
that O
he O
might O
be O
always O
flying O
about O
from O
one O
place O
to O
another O
, O
and O
never O
settled O
at O
Netherfield O
as O
he O
ought O
to O
be O
. O
Lady O
Lucas O
quieted O
her O
fears O
a O
little O
by O
starting O
the O
idea O
of O
his O
being O
gone O
to O
London O
only O
to O
get O
a O
large O
party O
for O
the O
ball O
; O
and O
a O
report O
soon O
followed O
that O
Mr. O
Bingley O
was O
to O
bring O
twelve O
ladies O
and O
seven O
gentlemen O
with O
him O
to O
the O
assembly O
. O
The O
girls O
grieved O
over O
such O
a O
number O
of O
ladies O
; O
but O
were O
comforted O
the O
day O
before O
the O
ball O
by O
hearing O
, O
that O
instead O
of O
twelve O
, O
he O
had O
brought O
only O
six O
with O
him O
from O
London O
, O
his O
five O
sisters O
and O
a O
cousin O
. O
And O
when O
the O
party O
entered O
the O
assembly O
room O
, O
it O
consisted O
of O
only O
five O
altogether O
; O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
his O
two O
sisters O
, O
the O
husband O
of O
the O
eldest O
, O
and O
another O
young O
man O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
was O
good O
looking O
and O
gentlemanlike O
; O
he O
had O
a O
pleasant O
countenance O
, O
and O
easy O
, O
unaffected O
manners O
. O
His O
sisters O
were O
fine O
women O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
decided O
fashion O
. O
His O
brother-in-law O
, O
Mr. O
Hurst O
, O
merely O
looked O
the O
gentleman O
; O
but O
his O
friend O
Mr. O
Darcy O
soon O
drew O
the O
attention O
of O
the O
room O
by O
his O
fine O
, O
tall O
person O
, O
handsome O
features O
, O
noble O
mein O
; O
and O
the O
report O
which O
was O
in O
general O
circulation O
within O
five O
minutes O
after O
his O
en- O
trance O
, O
of O
his O
having O
ten O
thousand O
a O
year O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
pronounced O
him O
to O
be O
a O
fine O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
, O
the O
ladies O
declared O
he O
was O
much O
handsomer O
than O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
and O
he O
was O
looked O
at O
with O
great O
admiration O
for O
about O
half O
the O
evening O
, O
till O
his O
manners O
gave O
a O
disgust O
which O
turned O
the O
tide O
of O
his O
popularity O
; O
for O
he O
was O
discovered O
to O
be O
proud O
, O
to O
be O
above O
his O
company O
, O
and O
above O
being O
pleased O
; O
and O
not O
all O
his O
large O
estate O
in O
Derbyshire O
could O
then O
save O
him O
from O
having O
a O
most O
forbidding O
, O
disagreeable O
countenance O
, O
and O
being O
unworthy O
to O
be O
compared O
with O
his O
friend O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
had O
soon O
made O
himself O
acquainted O
with O
all O
the O
principal O
people O
in O
the O
room O
; O
he O
was O
lively O
and O
unreserved O
, O
danced O
every O
dance O
, O
was O
angry O
that O
the O
ball O
closed O
so O
early O
, O
and O
talked O
of O
giving O
one O
himself O
at O
Netherfield O
. O
Such O
amiable O
quali- O
ties O
must O
speak O
for O
themselves O
. O
What O
a O
contrast O
between O
him O
and O
his O
friend O
! O
Mr. O
Darcy O
danced O
only O
once O
with O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
once O
with O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
declined O
being O
introduced O
to O
any O
other O
lady O
, O
and O
spent O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
in O
walking O
about O
the O
room O
, O
speaking O
occasionally O
to O
one O
of O
his O
own O
party O
. O
His O
character O
was O
decided O
. O
He O
was O
the O
proudest O
, O
most O
disagreeable O
man O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
every O
body O
hoped O
that O
he O
would O
never O
come O
there O
again O
. O
Amongst O
the O
most O
violent O
against O
him O
was O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
whose O
dislike O
of O
his O
general O
behaviour O
, O
was O
sharpened O
into O
particular O
resentment O
, O
by O
his O
having O
slighted O
one O
of O
her O
daughters O
. O
Elizabeth O
Bennet O
had O
been O
obliged O
, O
by O
the O
scarcity O
of O
gentlemen O
, O
to O
sit O
down O
for O
two O
dances O
; O
and O
during O
part O
of O
that O
time O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
been O
standing O
near O
enough O
for O
her O
to O
overhear O
a O
conversation O
between O
him O
and O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
who O
came O
from O
the O
dance O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
to O
press O
his O
friend O
to O
join O
it O
. O
" O
Come O
, O
Darcy O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
I O
must O
have O
you O
dance O
. O
I O
hate O
to O
see O
you O
standing O
about O
by O
yourself O
in O
this O
stupid O
manner O
. O
You O
had O
much O
better O
dance O
. O
" O
" O
I O
certainly O
shall O
not O
. O
You O
know O
how O
I O
detest O
it O
, O
unless O
I O
am O
particularly O
acquainted O
with O
my O
partner O
. O
At O
such O
an O
assembly O
as O
this O
, O
it O
would O
be O
insupportable O
. O
Your O
sisters O
are O
engaged O
, O
and O
there O
is O
not O
another O
woman O
in O
the O
room O
, O
whom O
it O
would O
not O
be O
a O
punishment O
to O
me O
to O
stand O
up O
with O
. O
" O
" O
I O
would O
not O
be O
so O
fastidious O
as O
you O
are O
, O
" O
cried O
Bingley O
, O
" O
for O
a O
kingdom O
! O
Upon O
my O
honour O
, O
I O
never O
met O
with O
so O
many O
pleasant O
girls O
in O
my O
life O
, O
as O
I O
have O
this O
evening O
; O
and O
there O
are O
several O
of O
them O
you O
see O
uncommonly O
pretty O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
dancing O
with O
the O
only O
handsome O
girl O
in O
the O
room O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
eldest O
Miss O
Bennet O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
she O
is O
the O
most O
beautiful O
creature O
I O
ever O
beheld O
! O
But O
there O
is O
one O
of O
her O
sisters O
sitting O
down O
just O
behind O
you O
, O
who O
is O
very O
pretty O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
very O
agreeable O
. O
Do O
let O
me O
ask O
my O
partner O
to O
introduce O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Which O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
" O
and O
turning O
round O
, O
he O
looked O
for O
a O
moment O
at O
Elizabeth O
, O
till O
catching O
her O
eye O
, O
he O
withdrew O
his O
own O
and O
coldly O
said O
, O
" O
She O
is O
tolerable O
; O
but O
not O
handsome O
enough O
to O
tempt O
me O
; O
and O
I O
am O
in O
no O
humour O
at O
present O
to O
give O
consequence O
to O
young O
ladies O
who O
are O
slighted O
by O
other O
men O
. O
You O
had O
better O
return O
to O
your O
partner O
and O
enjoy O
her O
smiles O
, O
for O
you O
are O
wasting O
your O
mite O
with O
me O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bingley O
followed O
his O
advice O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
walked O
off O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
remained O
with O
no O
very O
cordial O
feelings O
towards O
him O
. O
She O
told O
the O
story O
however O
with O
great O
spirit O
among O
her O
friends O
; O
for O
she O
had O
a O
lively O
, O
playful O
disposition O
, O
which O
delighted O
in O
any O
thing O
ridiculous O
. O
The O
evening O
altogether O
passed O
off O
pleasantly O
to O
the O
whole O
family O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
seen O
her O
eldest O
daughter O
much O
admired O
by O
the O
Netherfield O
party O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
had O
danced O
with O
her O
twice O
, O
and O
she O
had O
been O
distinguished O
by O
his O
sisters O
. O
Jane O
was O
as O
much O
gratified O
by O
this O
, O
as O
her O
mother O
could O
be O
, O
though O
in O
a O
quieter O
way O
. O
Elizabeth O
felt O
Jane O
's O
pleasure O
. O
Mary O
had O
heard O
herself O
mentioned O
to O
Miss O
Bingley O
as O
the O
most O
accomplished O
girl O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
; O
and O
Catherine O
and O
Lydia O
had O
been O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
be O
never O
without O
partners O
, O
which O
was O
all O
that O
they O
had O
yet O
learnt O
to O
care O
for O
at O
a O
ball O
. O
They O
returned O
therefore O
in O
good O
spirits O
to O
Longbourn O
, O
the O
village O
where O
they O
lived O
, O
and O
of O
which O
they O
were O
the O
principal O
inhabitants O
. O
They O
found O
Mr. O
Bennet O
still O
up O
. O
With O
a O
book O
he O
was O
regardless O
of O
time O
; O
and O
on O
the O
present O
occasion O
he O
had O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
curiosity O
as O
to O
the O
event O
of O
an O
evening O
which O
had O
raised O
such O
splendid O
expectations O
. O
He O
had O
rather O
hoped O
that O
all O
his O
wife O
's O
views O
on O
the O
stranger O
would O
be O
disappointed O
; O
but O
he O
soon O
found O
that O
he O
had O
a O
very O
different O
story O
to O
hear O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
" O
we O
have O
had O
a O
most O
delightful O
evening O
, O
a O
most O
excellent O
ball O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
had O
been O
there O
. O
Jane O
was O
so O
admired O
, O
nothing O
could O
be O
like O
it O
. O
Every O
body O
said O
how O
well O
she O
looked O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Bingley O
thought O
her O
quite O
beautiful O
, O
and O
danced O
with O
her O
twice O
. O
Only O
think O
of O
that O
my O
dear O
; O
he O
actually O
danced O
with O
her O
twice O
; O
and O
she O
was O
the O
only O
creature O
in O
the O
room O
that O
he O
asked O
a O
second O
time O
. O
First O
of O
all O
, O
he O
asked O
Miss O
Lucas O
. O
I O
was O
so O
vexed O
to O
see O
him O
stand O
up O
with O
her O
; O
but O
, O
however O
, O
he O
did O
not O
admire O
her O
at O
all O
: O
indeed O
, O
nobody O
can O
, O
you O
know O
; O
and O
he O
seemed O
quite O
struck O
with O
Jane O
as O
she O
was O
going O
down O
the O
dance O
. O
So O
, O
he O
enquired O
who O
she O
was O
, O
and O
got O
introduced O
, O
and O
asked O
her O
for O
the O
two O
next O
. O
Then O
, O
the O
two O
third O
he O
danced O
with O
Miss O
King O
, O
and O
the O
two O
fourth O
with O
Maria O
Lucas O
, O
and O
the O
two O
fifth O
with O
Jane O
again O
, O
and O
the O
two O
sixth O
with O
Lizzy O
, O
and O
the O
Boulanger O
. O
" O
" O
If O
he O
had O
had O
any O
compassion O
for O
me O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
husband O
impatiently O
, O
" O
he O
would O
not O
have O
danced O
half O
so O
much O
! O
For O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
say O
no O
more O
of O
his O
partners O
. O
Oh O
! O
that O
he O
had O
sprained O
his O
ancle O
in O
the O
first O
dance O
! O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
continued O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
delighted O
with O
him O
. O
He O
is O
so O
excessively O
handsome O
! O
and O
his O
sisters O
are O
charming O
women O
. O
I O
never O
in O
my O
life O
saw O
any O
thing O
more O
elegant O
than O
their O
dresses O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
the O
lace O
upon O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
's O
gown—— O
" O
Here O
she O
was O
interrupted O
again O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
protested O
against O
any O
description O
of O
finery O
. O
She O
was O
therefore O
obliged O
to O
seek O
another O
branch O
of O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
related O
, O
with O
much O
bitterness O
of O
spirit O
and O
some O
exaggeration O
, O
the O
shocking O
rudeness O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
" O
But O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
that O
Lizzy O
does O
not O
lose O
much O
by O
not O
suiting O
his O
fancy O
; O
for O
he O
is O
a O
most O
disagreeable O
, O
horrid O
man O
, O
not O
at O
all O
worth O
pleasing O
. O
So O
high O
and O
so O
conceited O
that O
there O
was O
no O
enduring O
him O
! O
He O
walked O
here O
, O
and O
he O
walked O
there O
, O
fancying O
himself O
so O
very O
great O
! O
Not O
handsome O
enough O
to O
dance O
with O
! O
I O
wish O
you O
had O
been O
there O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
to O
have O
given O
him O
one O
of O
your O
set O
downs O
. O
I O
quite O
detest O
the O
man O
. O
