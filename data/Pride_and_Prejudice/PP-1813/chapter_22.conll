The O
Bennets O
were O
engaged O
to O
dine O
with O
the O
Lucases O
, O
and O
again O
during O
the O
chief O
of O
the O
day O
, O
was O
Miss O
Lucas O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
listen O
to O
Mr. O
Collins O
. O
Elizabeth O
took O
an O
opportunity O
of O
thanking O
her O
. O
" O
It O
keeps O
him O
in O
good O
humour O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
and O
I O
am O
more O
obliged O
to O
you O
than O
I O
can O
express O
. O
" O
Charlotte O
assured O
her O
friend O
of O
her O
satisfaction O
in O
being O
useful O
, O
and O
that O
it O
amply O
repaid O
her O
for O
the O
little O
sacrifice O
of O
her O
time O
. O
This O
was O
very O
amiable O
, O
but O
Charlotte O
's O
kindness O
extended O
farther O
than O
Elizabeth O
had O
any O
conception O
of O
; O
—its O
object O
was O
nothing O
less O
, O
than O
to O
secure O
her O
from O
any O
return O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
addresses O
, O
by O
engaging O
them O
towards O
herself O
. O
Such O
was O
Miss O
Lucas O
's O
scheme O
; O
and O
appearances O
were O
so O
favourable O
that O
when O
they O
parted O
at O
night O
, O
she O
would O
have O
felt O
almost O
sure O
of O
success O
if O
he O
had O
not O
been O
to O
leave O
Hertfordshire O
so O
very O
soon O
. O
But O
here O
, O
she O
did O
injustice O
to O
the O
fire O
and O
independence O
of O
his O
character O
, O
for O
it O
led O
him O
to O
escape O
out O
of O
Longbourn O
House O
the O
next O
morning O
with O
admirable O
slyness O
, O
and O
hasten O
to O
Lucas O
Lodge O
to O
throw O
himself O
at O
her O
feet O
. O
He O
was O
anxious O
to O
avoid O
the O
notice O
of O
his O
cousins O
, O
from O
a O
conviction O
that O
if O
they O
saw O
him O
depart O
, O
they O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
conjecture O
his O
design O
, O
and O
he O
was O
not O
willing O
to O
have O
the O
attempt O
known O
till O
its O
success O
could O
be O
known O
likewise O
; O
for O
though O
feeling O
almost O
secure O
, O
and O
with O
reason O
, O
for O
Charlotte O
had O
been O
tolerably O
encouraging O
, O
he O
was O
comparatively O
diffident O
since O
the O
adventure O
of O
Wednesday O
. O
His O
reception O
however O
was O
of O
the O
most O
flattering O
kind O
. O
Miss O
Lucas O
perceived O
him O
from O
an O
upper O
window O
as O
he O
walked O
towards O
the O
house O
, O
and O
instantly O
set O
out O
to O
meet O
him O
accidentally O
in O
the O
lane O
. O
But O
little O
had O
she O
dared O
to O
hope O
that O
so O
much O
love O
and O
eloquence O
awaited O
her O
there O
. O
In O
as O
short O
a O
time O
as O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
long O
speeches O
would O
allow O
, O
every O
thing O
was O
settled O
between O
them O
to O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
both O
; O
and O
as O
they O
entered O
the O
house O
, O
he O
earnestly O
entreated O
her O
to O
name O
the O
day O
that O
was O
to O
make O
him O
the O
happiest O
of O
men O
; O
and O
though O
such O
a O
solicitation O
must O
be O
waved O
for O
the O
present O
, O
the O
lady O
felt O
no O
inclination O
to O
trifle O
with O
his O
happiness O
. O
The O
stupidity O
with O
which O
he O
was O
favoured O
by O
nature O
, O
must O
guard O
his O
courtship O
from O
any O
charm O
that O
could O
make O
a O
woman O
wish O
for O
its O
continuance O
; O
and O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
who O
accepted O
him O
solely O
from O
the O
pure O
and O
disinterested O
desire O
of O
an O
establishment O
, O
cared O
not O
how O
soon O
that O
establishment O
were O
gained O
. O
Sir O
William O
and O
Lady O
Lucas O
were O
speedily O
applied O
to O
for O
their O
consent O
; O
and O
it O
was O
bestowed O
with O
a O
most O
joyful O
alacrity O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
present O
circumstances O
made O
it O
a O
most O
eligible O
match O
for O
their O
daughter O
, O
to O
whom O
they O
could O
give O
little O
fortune O
; O
and O
his O
prospects O
of O
future O
wealth O
were O
exceedingly O
fair O
. O
Lady O
Lucas O
began O
directly O
to O
calculate O
with O
more O
interest O
than O
the O
matter O
had O
ever O
excited O
before O
, O
how O
many O
years O
longer O
Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
likely O
to O
live O
; O
and O
Sir O
William O
gave O
it O
as O
his O
decided O
opinion O
, O
that O
whenever O
Mr. O
Collins O
should O
be O
in O
possession O
of O
the O
Longbourn O
estate O
, O
it O
would O
be O
highly O
expedient O
that O
both O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
should O
make O
their O
appearance O
at O
St. O
James O
's O
. O
The O
whole O
family O
in O
short O
were O
properly O
overjoyed O
on O
the O
occasion O
. O
The O
younger O
girls O
formed O
hopes O
of O
coming O
out O
a O
year O
or O
two O
sooner O
than O
they O
might O
otherwise O
have O
done O
; O
and O
the O
boys O
were O
relieved O
from O
their O
apprehension O
of O
Charlotte O
's O
dying O
an O
old O
maid O
. O
Charlotte O
herself O
was O
tolerably O
composed O
. O
She O
had O
gained O
her O
point O
, O
and O
had O
time O
to O
consider O
of O
it O
. O
Her O
reflections O
were O
in O
general O
satisfactory O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
to O
be O
sure O
was O
neither O
sensible O
nor O
agreeable O
; O
his O
society O
was O
irksome O
, O
and O
his O
attachment O
to O
her O
must O
be O
imaginary O
. O
But O
still O
he O
would O
be O
her O
husband.—Without O
thinking O
highly O
either O
of O
men O
or O
of O
matrimony O
, O
marriage O
had O
always O
been O
her O
object O
; O
it O
was O
the O
only O
honourable O
provision O
for O
well-educated O
young O
women O
of O
small O
fortune O
, O
and O
however O
uncertain O
of O
giving O
happiness O
, O
must O
be O
their O
pleasantest O
preservative O
from O
want O
. O
This O
preservative O
she O
had O
now O
obtained O
; O
and O
at O
the O
age O
of O
twenty-seven O
, O
without O
having O
ever O
been O
handsome O
, O
she O
felt O
all O
the O
good O
luck O
of O
it O
. O
The O
least O
agreeable O
circumstance O
in O
the O
business O
, O
was O
the O
surprise O
it O
must O
occasion O
to O
Elizabeth O
Bennet O
, O
whose O
friendship O
she O
valued O
beyond O
that O
of O
any O
other O
person O
. O
Elizabeth O
would O
wonder O
, O
and O
probably O
would O
blame O
her O
; O
and O
though O
her O
resolution O
was O
not O
to O
be O
shaken O
, O
her O
feelings O
must O
be O
hurt O
by O
such O
disapprobation O
. O
She O
resolved O
to O
give O
her O
the O
information O
herself O
, O
and O
therefore O
charged O
Mr. O
Collins O
when O
he O
returned O
to O
Longbourn O
to O
dinner O
, O
to O
drop O
no O
hint O
of O
what O
had O
passed O
before O
any O
of O
the O
family O
. O
A O
promise O
of O
secrecy O
was O
of O
course O
very O
dutifully O
given O
, O
but O
it O
could O
not O
be O
kept O
without O
difficulty O
; O
for O
the O
curiosity O
excited O
by O
his O
long O
absence O
, O
burst O
forth O
in O
such O
very O
direct O
questions O
on O
his O
return O
, O
as O
required O
some O
ingenuity O
to O
evade O
, O
and O
he O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
exercising O
great O
self-denial O
, O
for O
he O
was O
longing O
to O
publish O
his O
prosperous O
love O
. O
As O
he O
was O
to O
begin O
his O
journey O
too O
early O
on O
the O
morrow O
to O
see O
any O
of O
the O
family O
, O
the O
ceremony O
of O
leave-taking O
was O
performed O
when O
the O
ladies O
moved O
for O
the O
night O
; O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
with O
great O
politeness O
and O
cordiality O
said O
how O
happy O
they O
should O
be O
to O
see O
him O
at O
Longbourn O
again O
, O
whenever O
his O
other O
engagements O
might O
allow O
him O
to O
visit O
them O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Madam O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
this O
invitation O
is O
particularly O
gratifying O
, O
because O
it O
is O
what O
I O
have O
been O
hoping O
to O
receive O
; O
and O
you O
may O
be O
very O
certain O
that O
I O
shall O
avail O
myself O
of O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
" O
They O
were O
all O
astonished O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
who O
could O
by O
no O
means O
wish O
for O
so O
speedy O
a O
return O
, O
immediately O
said O
, O
" O
But O
is O
there O
not O
danger O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
disapprobation O
here O
, O
my O
good O
sir O
? O
—You O
had O
better O
neglect O
your O
relations O
, O
than O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
offending O
your O
patroness O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
sir O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
" O
I O
am O
particularly O
obliged O
to O
you O
for O
this O
friendly O
caution O
, O
and O
you O
may O
depend O
upon O
my O
not O
taking O
so O
material O
a O
step O
without O
her O
ladyship O
's O
concurrence O
. O
" O
" O
You O
can O
not O
be O
too O
much O
on O
your O
guard O
. O
Risk O
any O
thing O
rather O
than O
her O
displeasure O
; O
and O
if O
you O
find O
it O
likely O
to O
be O
raised O
by O
your O
coming O
to O
us O
again O
, O
which O
I O
should O
think O
exceedingly O
probable O
, O
stay O
quietly O
at O
home O
, O
and O
be O
satisfied O
that O
we O
shall O
take O
no O
offence O
. O
" O
" O
Believe O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
sir O
, O
my O
gratitude O
is O
warmly O
excited O
by O
such O
affectionate O
attention O
; O
and O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
you O
will O
speedily O
receive O
from O
me O
a O
letter O
of O
thanks O
for O
this O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
every O
other O
mark O
of O
your O
regard O
during O
my O
stay O
in O
Hertfordshire O
. O
As O
for O
my O
fair O
cousins O
, O
though O
my O
absence O
may O
not O
be O
long O
enough O
to O
render O
it O
necessary O
, O
I O
shall O
now O
take O
the O
liberty O
of O
wishing O
them O
health O
and O
happiness O
, O
not O
excepting O
my O
cousin O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
With O
proper O
civilities O
the O
ladies O
then O
withdrew O
; O
all O
of O
them O
equally O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
he O
meditated O
a O
quick O
return O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
wished O
to O
understand O
by O
it O
that O
he O
thought O
of O
paying O
his O
addresses O
to O
one O
of O
her O
younger O
girls O
, O
and O
Mary O
might O
have O
been O
prevailed O
on O
to O
accept O
him O
. O
She O
rated O
his O
abilities O
much O
higher O
than O
any O
of O
the O
others O
; O
there O
was O
a O
solidity O
in O
his O
reflections O
which O
often O
struck O
her O
, O
and O
though O
by O
no O
means O
so O
clever O
as O
herself O
, O
she O
thought O
that O
if O
encouraged O
to O
read O
and O
improve O
himself O
by O
such O
an O
example O
as O
her O
's O
, O
he O
might O
become O
a O
very O
agreeable O
companion O
. O
But O
on O
the O
following O
morning O
, O
every O
hope O
of O
this O
kind O
was O
done O
away O
. O
Miss O
Lucas O
called O
soon O
after O
breakfast O
, O
and O
in O
a O
private O
conference O
with O
Elizabeth O
related O
the O
event O
of O
the O
day O
before O
. O
The O
possibility O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
fancying O
himself O
in O
love O
with O
her O
friend O
had O
once O
occurred O
to O
Elizabeth O
within O
the O
last O
day O
or O
two O
; O
but O
that O
Charlotte O
could O
encourage O
him O
, O
seemed O
almost O
as O
far O
from O
possibility O
as O
that O
she O
could O
encourage O
him O
herself O
, O
and O
her O
astonishment O
was O
consequently O
so O
great O
as O
to O
overcome O
at O
first O
the O
bounds O
of O
decorum O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
help O
crying O
out O
, O
" O
Engaged O
to O
Mr. O
Collins O
! O
my O
dear O
Charlotte O
, O
—impossible O
! O
" O
The O
steady O
countenance O
which O
Miss O
Lucas O
had O
commanded O
in O
telling O
her O
story O
, O
gave O
way O
to O
a O
momentary O
confusion O
here O
on O
receiving O
so O
direct O
a O
reproach O
; O
though O
, O
as O
it O
was O
no O
more O
than O
she O
expected O
, O
she O
soon O
regained O
her O
composure O
, O
and O
calmly O
replied O
, O
" O
Why O
should O
you O
be O
surprised O
, O
my O
dear O
Eliza O
? O
—Do O
you O
think O
it O
incredible O
that O
Mr. O
Collins O
should O
be O
able O
to O
procure O
any O
woman O
's O
good O
opinion O
, O
because O
he O
was O
not O
so O
happy O
as O
to O
succeed O
with O
you O
? O
" O
But O
Elizabeth O
had O
now O
recollected O
herself O
, O
and O
making O
a O
strong O
effort O
for O
it O
, O
was O
able O
to O
assure O
her O
with O
tolerable O
firmness O
that O
the O
prospect O
of O
their O
relationship O
was O
highly O
grateful O
to O
her O
, O
and O
that O
she O
wished O
her O
all O
imaginable O
happiness O
. O
" O
I O
see O
what O
you O
are O
feeling O
, O
" O
replied O
Charlotte O
, O
— O
" O
you O
must O
be O
surprised O
, O
very O
much O
surprised O
, O
—so O
lately O
as O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
wishing O
to O
marry O
you O
. O
But O
when O
you O
have O
had O
time O
to O
think O
it O
all O
over O
, O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
be O
satisfied O
with O
what O
I O
have O
done O
. O
I O
am O
not O
romantic O
you O
know O
. O
I O
never O
was O
. O
I O
ask O
only O
a O
comfortable O
home O
; O
and O
considering O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
character O
, O
connections O
, O
and O
situation O
in O
life O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
my O
chance O
of O
happiness O
with O
him O
is O
as O
fair O
, O
as O
most O
people O
can O
boast O
on O
entering O
the O
marriage O
state O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
quietly O
answered O
" O
Undoubtedly O
; O
" O
—and O
after O
an O
awkward O
pause O
, O
they O
returned O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
. O
Charlotte O
did O
not O
stay O
much O
longer O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
then O
left O
to O
reflect O
on O
what O
she O
had O
heard O
. O
It O
was O
a O
long O
time O
before O
she O
became O
at O
all O
reconciled O
to O
the O
idea O
of O
so O
unsuitable O
a O
match O
. O
The O
strangeness O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
making O
two O
offers O
of O
marriage O
within O
three O
days O
, O
was O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
of O
his O
being O
now O
accepted O
. O
She O
had O
always O
felt O
that O
Charlotte O
's O
opinion O
of O
matrimony O
was O
not O
exactly O
like O
her O
own O
, O
but O
she O
could O
not O
have O
supposed O
it O
possible O
that O
when O
called O
into O
action O
, O
she O
would O
have O
sacrificed O
every O
better O
feeling O
to O
worldly O
advantage O
. O
Charlotte O
the O
wife O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
was O
a O
most O
humiliating O
picture O
! O
—And O
to O
the O
pang O
of O
a O
friend O
disgracing O
herself O
and O
sunk O
in O
her O
esteem O
, O
was O
added O
the O
distressing O
conviction O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
that O
friend O
to O
be O
tolerably O
happy O
in O
the O
lot O
she O
had O
chosen O
. O
