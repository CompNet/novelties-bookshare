Mr. O
Wickham O
was O
so O
perfectly O
satisfied O
with O
this O
conversation O
, O
that O
he O
never O
again O
distressed O
himself O
, O
or O
provoked O
his O
dear O
sister O
Elizabeth O
, O
by O
introducing O
the O
subject O
of O
it O
; O
and O
she O
was O
pleased O
to O
find O
that O
she O
had O
said O
enough O
to O
keep O
him O
quiet O
. O
The O
day O
of O
his O
and O
Lydia O
's O
departure O
soon O
came O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
forced O
to O
submit O
to O
a O
separation O
, O
which O
, O
as O
her O
husband O
by O
no O
means O
entered O
into O
her O
scheme O
of O
their O
all O
going O
to O
Newcastle O
, O
was O
likely O
to O
continue O
at O
least O
a O
twelvemonth O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
Lydia O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
, O
" O
when O
shall O
we O
meet O
again O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
lord O
! O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
Not O
these O
two O
or O
three O
years O
perhaps O
. O
" O
" O
Write O
to O
me O
very O
often O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
" O
" O
As O
often O
as O
I O
can O
. O
But O
you O
know O
married O
women O
have O
never O
much O
time O
for O
writing O
. O
My O
sisters O
may O
write O
to O
me O
. O
They O
will O
have O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
adieus O
were O
much O
more O
affectionate O
than O
his O
wife O
's O
. O
He O
smiled O
, O
looked O
handsome O
, O
and O
said O
many O
pretty O
things O
. O
" O
He O
is O
as O
fine O
a O
fellow O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
as O
ever O
I O
saw O
. O
" O
He O
simpers O
, O
and O
smirks O
, O
and O
makes O
love O
to O
us O
all O
. O
I O
am O
prodigiously O
proud O
of O
him O
. O
I O
defy O
even O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
himself O
, O
to O
produce O
a O
more O
valuable O
son-in-law O
. O
" O
The O
loss O
of O
her O
daughter O
made O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
very O
dull O
for O
several O
days O
. O
" O
I O
often O
think O
, O
" O
said O
she O
" O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O
so O
bad O
as O
parting O
with O
one O
's O
friends O
. O
One O
seems O
so O
forlorn O
without O
them O
. O
" O
" O
This O
is O
the O
consequence O
you O
see O
, O
Madam O
, O
of O
marrying O
a O
daughter O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
It O
must O
make O
you O
better O
satisfied O
that O
your O
other O
four O
are O
single O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
no O
such O
thing O
. O
Lydia O
does O
not O
leave O
me O
because O
she O
is O
married O
; O
but O
only O
because O
her O
husband O
's O
regiment O
happens O
to O
be O
so O
far O
off O
. O
If O
that O
had O
been O
nearer O
, O
she O
would O
not O
have O
gone O
so O
soon O
. O
" O
But O
the O
spiritless O
condition O
which O
this O
event O
threw O
her O
into O
, O
was O
shortly O
relieved O
, O
and O
her O
mind O
opened O
again O
to O
the O
agitation O
of O
hope O
, O
by O
an O
article O
of O
news O
, O
which O
then O
began O
to O
be O
in O
circulation O
. O
The O
housekeeper O
at O
Netherfield O
had O
received O
orders O
to O
prepare O
for O
the O
arrival O
of O
her O
master O
, O
who O
was O
coming O
down O
in O
a O
day O
or O
two O
, O
to O
shoot O
there O
for O
several O
weeks O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
quite O
in O
the O
fidgets O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
Jane O
, O
and O
smiled O
, O
and O
shook O
her O
head O
by O
turns O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
and O
so O
Mr. O
Bingley O
is O
coming O
down O
, O
sister O
, O
" O
( O
for O
Mrs. O
Phillips O
first O
brought O
her O
the O
news O
. O
) O
" O
Well O
, O
so O
much O
the O
better O
. O
Not O
that O
I O
care O
about O
it O
, O
though O
. O
He O
is O
nothing O
to O
us O
, O
you O
know O
, O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
never O
want O
to O
see O
him O
again O
. O
But O
, O
however O
, O
he O
is O
very O
welcome O
to O
come O
to O
Netherfield O
, O
if O
he O
likes O
it O
. O
And O
who O
knows O
what O
may O
happen O
? O
But O
that O
is O
nothing O
to O
us O
. O
You O
know O
, O
sister O
, O
we O
agreed O
long O
ago O
never O
to O
mention O
a O
word O
about O
it O
. O
And O
so O
, O
is O
it O
quite O
certain O
he O
is O
coming O
? O
" O
" O
You O
may O
depend O
on O
it O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
other O
, O
" O
for O
Mrs. O
Nicholls O
was O
in O
Meryton O
last O
night O
; O
I O
saw O
her O
passing O
by O
, O
and O
went O
out O
myself O
on O
purpose O
to O
know O
the O
truth O
of O
it O
; O
and O
she O
told O
me O
that O
it O
was O
certain O
true O
. O
He O
comes O
down O
on O
Thursday O
at O
the O
latest O
, O
very O
likely O
on O
Wednesday O
. O
She O
was O
going O
to O
the O
butcher O
's O
, O
she O
told O
me O
, O
on O
purpose O
to O
order O
in O
some O
more O
meat O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
and O
she O
has O
got O
three O
couple O
of O
ducks O
, O
just O
fit O
to O
be O
killed O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
had O
not O
been O
able O
to O
of O
his O
coming O
, O
without O
changing O
colour O
. O
It O
was O
many O
months O
since O
she O
had O
mentioned O
his O
name O
to O
Elizabeth O
; O
but O
now O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
alone O
together O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
I O
saw O
you O
look O
at O
me O
to O
day O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
when O
my O
aunt O
told O
us O
of O
the O
present O
report O
; O
and O
I O
know O
I O
appeared O
distressed O
. O
But O
do O
n't O
imagine O
it O
was O
from O
any O
silly O
cause O
. O
I O
was O
only O
confused O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
because O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
should O
be O
looked O
at O
. O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
, O
that O
the O
news O
does O
not O
affect O
me O
either O
with O
pleasure O
or O
pain O
. O
I O
am O
glad O
of O
one O
thing O
, O
that O
he O
comes O
alone O
; O
because O
we O
shall O
see O
the O
less O
of O
him O
. O
Not O
that O
I O
am O
afraid O
of O
myself O
, O
but O
I O
dread O
other O
people O
's O
remarks O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
make O
of O
it O
. O
Had O
she O
not O
seen O
him O
in O
Derbyshire O
, O
she O
might O
have O
supposed O
him O
capable O
of O
coming O
there O
, O
with O
no O
other O
view O
than O
what O
was O
acknowledged O
; O
but O
she O
still O
thought O
him O
partial O
to O
Jane O
, O
and O
she O
wavered O
as O
to O
the O
greater O
probability O
of O
his O
coming O
there O
with O
his O
friend O
's O
permission O
, O
or O
being O
bold O
enough O
to O
come O
without O
it O
. O
" O
Yet O
it O
is O
hard O
, O
" O
she O
sometimes O
thought O
, O
" O
that O
this O
poor O
man O
can O
not O
come O
to O
a O
house O
, O
which O
he O
has O
legally O
hired O
, O
without O
raising O
all O
this O
speculation O
! O
I O
will O
leave O
him O
to O
himself O
. O
" O
In O
spite O
of O
what O
her O
sister O
declared O
, O
and O
really O
believed O
to O
be O
her O
feelings O
, O
in O
the O
expectation O
of O
his O
arrival O
, O
Elizabeth O
could O
easily O
perceive O
that O
her O
spirits O
were O
affected O
by O
it O
. O
They O
were O
more O
disturbed O
, O
more O
unequal O
, O
than O
she O
had O
often O
seen O
them O
. O
The O
subject O
which O
had O
been O
so O
warmly O
canvassed O
between O
their O
parents O
, O
about O
a O
twelvemonth O
ago O
, O
was O
now O
brought O
forward O
again O
. O
" O
As O
soon O
as O
ever O
Mr. O
Bingley O
comes O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
you O
will O
wait O
on O
him O
of O
course O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
. O
You O
forced O
me O
into O
visiting O
him O
last O
year O
, O
and O
promised O
if O
I O
went O
to O
see O
him O
, O
he O
should O
marry O
one O
of O
my O
daughters O
. O
But O
it O
ended O
in O
nothing O
, O
and O
I O
will O
not O
be O
sent O
on O
a O
fool O
's O
errand O
a O
gain O
. O
" O
His O
wife O
represented O
to O
him O
how O
absolutely O
necessary O
such O
an O
attention O
would O
be O
from O
all O
the O
neighbouring O
gentlemen O
, O
on O
his O
returning O
to O
Netherfield O
. O
" O
'T O
is O
an O
etiquette O
I O
despise O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
If O
he O
wants O
our O
society O
, O
let O
him O
seek O
it O
. O
He O
knows O
where O
we O
live O
. O
I O
will O
not O
spend O
my O
hours O
in O
running O
after O
my O
neighbours O
every O
time O
they O
go O
away O
, O
and O
come O
back O
again O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
all O
I O
know O
is O
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
abominably O
rude O
if O
you O
do O
not O
wait O
on O
him O
. O
But O
, O
however O
, O
that O
sha O
n't O
prevent O
my O
asking O
him O
to O
dine O
here O
, O
I O
am O
determined O
. O
We O
must O
have O
Mrs. O
Long O
and O
the O
Gouldings O
soon O
. O
That O
will O
make O
thirteen O
with O
ourselves O
, O
so O
there O
will O
be O
just O
room O
at O
table O
for O
him O
. O
" O
Consoled O
by O
this O
resolution O
, O
she O
was O
the O
better O
able O
to O
bear O
her O
husband O
's O
incivility O
; O
though O
it O
was O
very O
mortifying O
to O
know O
that O
her O
neighbours O
might O
all O
see O
Mr. O
Bingley O
in O
consequence O
of O
it O
, O
before O
they O
did O
. O
As O
the O
day O
of O
his O
arrival O
drew O
near O
, O
" O
I O
begin O
to O
be O
sorry O
that O
he O
comes O
at O
all O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
to O
her O
sister O
. O
" O
It O
would O
be O
nothing O
; O
I O
could O
see O
him O
with O
perfect O
indifference O
, O
but O
I O
can O
hardly O
bear O
to O
hear O
it O
thus O
perpetually O
talked O
of O
. O
My O
mother O
means O
well O
; O
but O
she O
does O
not O
know O
, O
no O
one O
can O
know O
how O
much O
I O
suffer O
from O
what O
she O
says O
. O
Happy O
shall O
I O
be O
, O
when O
his O
stay O
at O
Netherfield O
is O
over O
! O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
say O
any O
thing O
to O
comfort O
you O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
but O
it O
is O
wholly O
out O
of O
my O
power O
. O
You O
must O
feel O
it O
; O
and O
the O
usual O
satisfaction O
of O
preaching O
patience O
to O
a O
sufferer O
is O
denied O
me O
, O
because O
you O
have O
always O
so O
much O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bingley O
arrived O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
through O
the O
assistance O
of O
servants O
, O
contrived O
to O
have O
the O
earliest O
tidings O
of O
it O
, O
that O
the O
period O
of O
anxiety O
and O
fretfulness O
on O
her O
side O
, O
might O
be O
as O
long O
as O
it O
could O
. O
She O
counted O
the O
days O
that O
must O
intervene O
before O
their O
invitation O
could O
be O
sent O
; O
hopeless O
of O
seeing O
him O
before O
. O
But O
on O
the O
third O
morning O
after O
his O
arrival O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
she O
saw O
him O
from O
her O
dressing-room O
window O
, O
enter O
the O
paddock O
, O
and O
ride O
towards O
the O
house O
. O
Her O
daughters O
were O
eagerly O
called O
to O
partake O
of O
her O
joy O
. O
Jane O
resolutely O
kept O
her O
place O
at O
the O
table O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
, O
to O
satisfy O
her O
mother O
, O
went O
to O
the O
window—she O
looked O
, O
—she O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy O
with O
him O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
again O
by O
her O
sister O
. O
" O
There O
is O
a O
gentleman O
with O
him O
, O
mamma O
, O
" O
said O
Kitty O
; O
" O
who O
can O
it O
be O
? O
" O
" O
Some O
acquaintance O
or O
other O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I O
suppose O
; O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O
" O
" O
La O
! O
" O
replied O
Kitty O
, O
" O
it O
looks O
just O
like O
that O
man O
that O
used O
to O
be O
with O
him O
before O
. O
Mr. O
what O
's O
his O
name O
. O
That O
tall O
, O
proud O
man O
. O
" O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
Mr. O
Darcy O
! O
—and O
so O
it O
does O
I O
vow O
. O
Well O
, O
any O
friend O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
will O
always O
be O
welcome O
here O
to O
be O
sure O
; O
but O
else O
I O
must O
say O
that O
I O
hate O
the O
very O
sight O
of O
him O
. O
" O
Jane O
looked O
at O
Elizabeth O
with O
surprise O
and O
concern O
. O
She O
knew O
but O
little O
of O
their O
meeting O
in O
Derbyshire O
, O
and O
therefore O
felt O
for O
the O
awkwardness O
which O
must O
attend O
her O
sister O
, O
in O
seeing O
him O
almost O
for O
the O
first O
time O
after O
receiving O
his O
explanatory O
letter O
. O
Both O
sisters O
were O
uncomfortable O
enough O
. O
Each O
felt O
for O
the O
other O
, O
and O
of O
course O
for O
themselves O
; O
and O
their O
mother O
talked O
on O
, O
of O
her O
dislike O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
and O
her O
resolution O
to O
be O
civil O
to O
him O
only O
as O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
friend O
, O
without O
being O
heard O
by O
either O
of O
them O
. O
But O
Elizabeth O
had O
sources O
of O
uneasiness O
which O
could O
not O
be O
suspected O
by O
Jane O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
had O
never O
yet O
had O
courage O
to O
shew O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
's O
letter O
, O
or O
to O
relate O
her O
own O
change O
of O
sentiment O
towards O
him O
. O
To O
Jane O
, O
he O
could O
be O
only O
a O
man O
whose O
proposals O
she O
had O
refused O
, O
and O
whose O
merit O
she O
had O
undervalued O
; O
but O
to O
her O
own O
more O
extensive O
information O
, O
he O
was O
the O
person O
, O
to O
whom O
the O
whole O
family O
were O
indebted O
for O
the O
first O
of O
benefits O
, O
and O
whom O
she O
regarded O
herself O
with O
an O
interest O
, O
if O
not O
quite O
so O
tender O
, O
at O
least O
as O
reasonable O
and O
just O
, O
as O
what O
Jane O
felt O
for O
Bingley O
. O
Her O
astonishment O
at O
his O
coming—at O
his O
coming O
to O
Netherfield O
, O
to O
Longbourn O
, O
and O
voluntarily O
seeking O
her O
again O
, O
was O
almost O
equal O
to O
what O
she O
had O
known O
on O
first O
witnessing O
his O
altered O
behaviour O
in O
Derbyshire O
. O
The O
colour O
which O
had O
been O
driven O
from O
her O
face O
, O
returned O
for O
half O
a O
minute O
with O
an O
additional O
glow O
, O
and O
a O
smile O
of O
delight O
added O
lustre O
to O
her O
eyes O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
for O
that O
space O
of O
time O
, O
that O
his O
affection O
and O
wishes O
must O
still O
be O
unshaken O
. O
But O
she O
would O
not O
be O
secure O
. O
" O
Let O
me O
first O
see O
how O
he O
behaves O
, O
" O
said O
she O
; O
" O
it O
will O
then O
be O
early O
enough O
for O
expectation O
. O
" O
She O
sat O
intently O
at O
work O
, O
striving O
to O
be O
composed O
, O
and O
without O
daring O
to O
lift O
up O
her O
eyes O
, O
till O
anxious O
curiosity O
carried O
them O
to O
the O
face O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
as O
the O
servant O
was O
approaching O
the O
door O
. O
Jane O
looked O
a O
little O
paler O
than O
usual O
, O
but O
more O
sedate O
than O
Elizabeth O
had O
expected O
. O
On O
the O
gentlemen O
's O
appearing O
, O
her O
colour O
increased O
; O
yet O
she O
received O
them O
with O
tolerable O
ease O
, O
and O
with O
a O
propriety O
of O
behaviour O
equally O
free O
from O
any O
symp- O
tom O
of O
resentment O
, O
or O
any O
unnecessary O
complaisance O
. O
Elizabeth O
said O
as O
little O
to O
either O
as O
civility O
would O
allow O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
again O
to O
her O
work O
, O
with O
an O
eagerness O
which O
it O
did O
not O
often O
command O
. O
She O
had O
ventured O
only O
one O
glance O
at O
Darcy O
. O
He O
looked O
serious O
as O
usual O
; O
and O
she O
thought O
, O
more O
as O
he O
had O
been O
used O
to O
look O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
than O
as O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
at O
Pemberley O
. O
But O
, O
perhaps O
he O
could O
not O
in O
her O
mother O
's O
presence O
be O
what O
he O
was O
before O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
. O
It O
was O
a O
painful O
, O
but O
not O
an O
improbable O
, O
conjecture O
. O
Bingley O
, O
she O
had O
likewise O
seen O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
and O
in O
that O
short O
period O
saw O
him O
looking O
both O
pleased O
and O
embarrassed O
. O
He O
was O
received O
by O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
civility O
, O
which O
made O
her O
two O
daughters O
ashamed O
, O
especially O
when O
contrasted O
with O
the O
cold O
and O
ceremonious O
politeness O
of O
her O
curtsey O
and O
address O
to O
his O
friend O
. O
Elizabeth O
particularly O
, O
who O
knew O
that O
her O
mother O
owed O
to O
the O
latter O
the O
preservation O
of O
her O
favourite O
daughter O
from O
irremediable O
infamy O
, O
was O
hurt O
and O
distressed O
to O
a O
most O
painful O
degree O
by O
a O
distinction O
so O
ill O
applied O
. O
Darcy O
, O
after O
enquiring O
of O
her O
how O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
did O
, O
a O
question O
which O
she O
could O
not O
answer O
without O
confusion O
, O
said O
scarcely O
any O
thing O
. O
He O
was O
not O
seated O
by O
her O
; O
perhaps O
that O
was O
the O
reason O
of O
his O
silence O
; O
but O
it O
had O
not O
been O
so O
in O
Derbyshire O
. O
There O
he O
had O
talked O
to O
her O
friends O
, O
when O
he O
could O
not O
to O
herself O
. O
But O
now O
several O
minutes O
elapsed O
, O
without O
bringing O
the O
sound O
of O
his O
voice O
; O
and O
when O
occasionally O
, O
unable O
to O
resist O
the O
impulse O
of O
curiosity O
, O
she O
raised O
her O
eyes O
to O
his O
face O
, O
she O
as O
often O
found O
him O
looking O
at O
Jane O
, O
as O
at O
herself O
, O
and O
frequently O
on O
no O
object O
but O
the O
ground O
. O
More O
thoughtfulness O
, O
and O
less O
anxiety O
to O
please O
than O
when O
they O
last O
met O
, O
were O
plainly O
expressed O
. O
She O
was O
disappointed O
, O
and O
angry O
with O
herself O
for O
being O
so O
. O
" O
Could O
I O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
otherwise O
! O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
Yet O
why O
did O
he O
come O
? O
" O
She O
was O
in O
no O
humour O
for O
conversation O
with O
any O
one O
but O
himself O
; O
and O
to O
him O
she O
had O
hardly O
courage O
to O
speak O
. O
She O
enquired O
after O
his O
sister O
, O
but O
could O
do O
no O
more O
. O
" O
It O
is O
a O
long O
time O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
since O
you O
went O
away O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
. O
He O
readily O
agreed O
to O
it O
. O
" O
I O
began O
to O
be O
afraid O
you O
would O
never O
come O
back O
again O
. O
People O
did O
say O
, O
you O
meant O
to O
quit O
the O
place O
entirely O
at O
Michaelmas O
; O
but O
, O
however O
, O
I O
hope O
it O
is O
not O
true O
. O
A O
great O
many O
changes O
have O
happened O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
since O
you O
went O
away O
. O
Miss O
Lucas O
is O
married O
and O
settled O
. O
And O
one O
of O
my O
own O
daughters O
. O
I O
suppose O
you O
have O
heard O
of O
it O
; O
indeed O
, O
you O
must O
have O
seen O
it O
in O
the O
papers O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
Times O
and O
the O
Courier O
, O
I O
know O
; O
though O
it O
was O
not O
put O
in O
as O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
. O
It O
was O
only O
said O
, O
'Lately O
, O
George O
Wickham O
, O
Esq O
. O
to O
Miss O
Lydia O
Bennet O
, O
' O
without O
there O
being O
a O
syllable O
said O
of O
her O
father O
, O
or O
the O
place O
where O
she O
lived O
, O
or O
any O
thing O
. O
It O
was O
my O
brother O
Gardiner O
's O
drawing O
up O
too O
, O
and O
I O
wonder O
how O
he O
came O
to O
make O
such O
an O
awkward O
business O
of O
it O
. O
Did O
you O
see O
it O
? O
" O
Bingley O
replied O
that O
he O
did O
, O
and O
made O
his O
congratulations O
. O
Elizabeth O
dared O
not O
lift O
up O
her O
eyes O
. O
How O
Mr. O
Darcy O
looked O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
. O
" O
It O
is O
a O
delightful O
thing O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
to O
have O
a O
daughter O
well O
married O
, O
" O
continued O
her O
mother O
; O
" O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
have O
her O
taken O
such O
a O
way O
from O
me O
. O
They O
are O
gone O
down O
to O
Newcastle O
, O
a O
place O
quite O
northward O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
and O
there O
they O
are O
to O
stay O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
long O
. O
His O
regiment O
is O
there O
; O
for O
I O
suppose O
you O
have O
heard O
of O
his O
leaving O
the O
——shire O
, O
and O
of O
his O
being O
gone O
into O
the O
regulars O
. O
Thank O
Heaven O
! O
he O
has O
some O
friends O
, O
though O
perhaps O
not O
so O
many O
as O
he O
deserves O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
knew O
this O
to O
be O
levelled O
at O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
was O
in O
such O
misery O
of O
shame O
, O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
keep O
her O
seat O
. O
It O
drew O
from O
her O
, O
however O
, O
the O
exertion O
of O
speaking O
, O
which O
nothing O
else O
had O
so O
effectually O
done O
before O
; O
and O
she O
asked O
Bingley O
, O
whether O
he O
meant O
to O
make O
any O
stay O
in O
the O
country O
at O
present O
. O
A O
few O
weeks O
, O
he O
believed O
. O
" O
When O
you O
have O
killed O
all O
your O
own O
birds O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
" O
said O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
I O
beg O
you O
will O
come O
here O
, O
and O
shoot O
as O
many O
as O
you O
please O
, O
on O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
manor O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
he O
will O
be O
vastly O
happy O
to O
oblige O
you O
, O
and O
will O
save O
all O
the O
best O
of O
the O
covies O
for O
you O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
's O
misery O
increased O
, O
at O
such O
unnecessary O
, O
such O
officious O
attention O
! O
Were O
the O
same O
fair O
prospect O
to O
arise O
at O
present O
, O
as O
had O
flattered O
them O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
every O
thing O
, O
she O
was O
persuaded O
, O
would O
be O
hastening O
to O
the O
same O
vexatious O
conclusion O
. O
At O
that O
instant O
she O
felt O
, O
that O
years O
of O
happiness O
could O
not O
make O
Jane O
or O
herself O
amends O
, O
for O
moments O
of O
such O
painful O
confusion O
. O
" O
The O
first O
wish O
of O
my O
heart O
, O
" O
said O
she O
to O
herself O
, O
" O
is O
never O
more O
to O
be O
in O
company O
with O
either O
of O
them O
. O
Their O
society O
can O
afford O
no O
pleasure O
, O
that O
will O
atone O
for O
such O
wretchedness O
as O
this O
! O
Let O
me O
never O
see O
either O
one O
or O
the O
other O
again O
! O
' O
Yet O
the O
misery O
, O
for O
which O
years O
of O
happiness O
were O
to O
offer O
no O
compensation O
, O
received O
soon O
afterwards O
material O
relief O
, O
from O
observing O
how O
much O
the O
beauty O
of O
her O
sister O
re-kindled O
the O
admiration O
of O
her O
former O
lover O
. O
When O
first O
he O
came O
in O
, O
he O
had O
spoken O
to O
her O
but O
little O
; O
but O
every O
five O
minutes O
seemed O
to O
be O
giving O
her O
more O
of O
his O
attention O
. O
He O
found O
her O
as O
handsome O
as O
she O
had O
been O
last O
year O
; O
as O
good O
natured O
, O
and O
as O
unaffected O
, O
though O
not O
quite O
so O
chatty O
. O
Jane O
was O
anxious O
that O
no O
difference O
should O
be O
perceived O
in O
her O
at O
all O
, O
and O
was O
really O
persuaded O
that O
she O
talked O
as O
much O
as O
ever O
. O
But O
her O
mind O
was O
so O
busily O
engaged O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
always O
know O
when O
she O
was O
silent O
. O
When O
the O
gentlemen O
rose O
to O
go O
away O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
mindful O
of O
her O
intended O
civility O
, O
and O
they O
were O
invited O
and O
engaged O
to O
dine O
at O
Longbourn O
in O
a O
few O
days O
time O
. O
" O
You O
are O
quite O
a O
visit O
in O
my O
debt O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
for O
when O
you O
went O
to O
town O
last O
winter O
, O
you O
promised O
to O
take O
a O
family O
dinner O
with O
us O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
returned O
. O
I O
have O
not O
forgot O
, O
you O
see O
; O
and O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
I O
was O
very O
much O
disappointed O
that O
you O
did O
not O
come O
back O
and O
keep O
your O
engagement O
. O
" O
Bingley O
looked O
a O
little O
silly O
at O
this O
reflection O
, O
and O
said O
something O
of O
his O
concern O
, O
at O
having O
been O
prevented O
by O
business O
. O
They O
then O
went O
away O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
been O
strongly O
inclined O
to O
ask O
them O
to O
stay O
and O
dine O
there O
, O
that O
day O
; O
but O
, O
though O
she O
always O
kept O
a O
very O
good O
table O
, O
she O
did O
not O
think O
any O
thing O
less O
than O
two O
courses O
, O
could O
be O
good O
enough O
for O
a O
man O
, O
on O
whom O
she O
had O
such O
anxious O
designs O
, O
or O
satisfy O
the O
appetite O
and O
pride O
of O
one O
who O
had O
ten O
thousand O
a-year O
. O
