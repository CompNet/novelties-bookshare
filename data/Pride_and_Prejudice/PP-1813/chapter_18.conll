Till O
Elizabeth O
entered O
the O
drawing-room O
at O
Netherfield O
and O
looked O
in O
vain O
for O
Mr. O
Wickham O
among O
the O
cluster O
of O
red O
coats O
there O
assembled O
, O
a O
doubt O
of O
his O
being O
present O
had O
never O
occurred O
to O
her O
. O
The O
certainty O
of O
meeting O
him O
had O
not O
been O
checked O
by O
any O
of O
those O
recollections O
that O
might O
not O
unreasonably O
have O
alarmed O
her O
. O
She O
had O
dressed O
with O
more O
than O
usual O
care O
, O
and O
prepared O
in O
the O
highest O
spirits O
for O
the O
conquest O
of O
all O
that O
remained O
unsubdued O
of O
his O
heart O
, O
trusting O
that O
it O
was O
not O
more O
than O
might O
be O
won O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
. O
But O
in O
an O
instant O
arose O
the O
dreadful O
suspicion O
of O
his O
being O
purposely O
omitted O
for O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
pleasure O
in O
the O
Bingley O
's O
invitation O
to O
the O
officers O
; O
and O
though O
this O
was O
not O
exactly O
the O
case O
, O
the O
absolute O
fact O
of O
his O
absence O
was O
pronounced O
by O
his O
friend O
Mr. O
Denny O
, O
to O
whom O
Lydia O
eagerly O
applied O
, O
and O
who O
told O
them O
that O
Wickham O
had O
been O
obliged O
to O
go O
to O
town O
on O
business O
the O
day O
before O
, O
and O
was O
not O
yet O
returned O
; O
adding O
, O
with O
a O
significant O
smile O
, O
" O
I O
do O
not O
imagine O
his O
business O
would O
have O
called O
him O
away O
just O
now O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
wished O
to O
avoid O
a O
certain O
gentleman O
here O
. O
" O
This O
part O
of O
his O
intelligence O
, O
though O
unheard O
by O
Lydia O
, O
was O
caught O
by O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
as O
it O
assured O
her O
that O
Darcy O
was O
not O
less O
answerable O
for O
Wickham O
's O
absence O
than O
if O
her O
first O
surmise O
had O
been O
just O
, O
every O
feeling O
of O
displeasure O
againt O
the O
former O
was O
so O
sharpened O
by O
immediate O
disappointment O
, O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
re- O
ply O
with O
tolerable O
civility O
to O
the O
polite O
inquiries O
which O
he O
directly O
afterwards O
approached O
to O
make.—Attention O
, O
forbearance O
, O
patience O
with O
Darcy O
, O
was O
injury O
to O
Wickham O
. O
She O
was O
resolved O
against O
any O
sort O
of O
conversation O
with O
him O
, O
and O
turned O
away O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
ill O
humour O
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
wholly O
surmount O
even O
in O
speaking O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
whose O
blind O
partiality O
provoked O
her O
. O
But O
Elizabeth O
was O
not O
formed O
for O
ill-humour O
; O
and O
though O
every O
prospect O
of O
her O
own O
was O
destroyed O
for O
the O
evening O
, O
it O
could O
not O
dwell O
long O
on O
her O
spirits O
; O
and O
having O
told O
all O
her O
griefs O
to O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
, O
whom O
she O
had O
not O
seen O
for O
a O
week O
, O
she O
was O
soon O
able O
to O
make O
a O
voluntary O
transition O
to O
the O
oddities O
of O
her O
cousin O
, O
and O
to O
point O
him O
out O
to O
her O
particular O
notice O
. O
The O
two O
first O
dances O
, O
however O
, O
brought O
a O
return O
of O
distress O
; O
they O
were O
dances O
of O
mortification O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
awkward O
and O
solemn O
, O
apologising O
instead O
of O
attending O
, O
and O
often O
moving O
wrong O
without O
being O
aware O
of O
it O
, O
gave O
her O
all O
the O
shame O
and O
misery O
which O
a O
disagreeable O
partner O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
dances O
can O
give O
. O
The O
moment O
of O
her O
release O
from O
him O
was O
exstacy O
. O
She O
danced O
next O
with O
an O
officer O
, O
and O
had O
the O
refreshment O
of O
talking O
of O
Wickham O
, O
and O
of O
hearing O
that O
he O
was O
universally O
liked O
. O
When O
those O
dances O
were O
over O
she O
returned O
to O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
, O
and O
was O
in O
conversation O
with O
her O
, O
when O
she O
found O
herself O
suddenly O
addressed O
by O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
who O
took O
her O
so O
much O
by O
surprise O
in O
his O
application O
for O
her O
hand O
, O
that O
, O
without O
knowing O
what O
she O
did O
, O
she O
accepted O
him O
. O
He O
walked O
away O
again O
immediately O
, O
and O
she O
was O
left O
to O
fret O
over O
her O
own O
want O
of O
presence O
of O
mind O
; O
Charlotte O
tried O
to O
console O
her O
. O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
you O
will O
find O
him O
very O
agreeable O
. O
" O
" O
Heaven O
forbid O
! O
—That O
would O
be O
the O
greatest O
misfortune O
of O
all O
! O
—To O
find O
a O
man O
agreeable O
whom O
one O
is O
determined O
to O
hate O
! O
—Do O
not O
wish O
me O
such O
an O
evil O
. O
" O
When O
the O
dancing O
recommenced O
, O
however O
, O
and O
Darcy O
approached O
to O
claim O
her O
hand O
, O
Charlotte O
could O
not O
help O
cautioning O
her O
in O
a O
whisper O
not O
to O
be O
a O
simpleton O
and O
allow O
her O
fancy O
for O
Wickham O
to O
make O
her O
appear O
unpleasant O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
a O
man O
of O
ten O
times O
his O
consequence O
. O
Elizabeth O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
took O
her O
place O
in O
the O
set O
, O
amazed O
at O
the O
dignity O
to O
which O
she O
was O
arrived O
in O
being O
allowed O
to O
stand O
opposite O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
and O
reading O
in O
her O
neighbours O
' O
looks O
their O
equal O
amazement O
in O
beholding O
it O
. O
They O
stood O
for O
some O
time O
without O
speaking O
a O
word O
; O
and O
she O
began O
to O
imagine O
that O
their O
silence O
was O
to O
last O
through O
the O
two O
dances O
, O
and O
at O
first O
was O
resolved O
not O
to O
break O
it O
; O
till O
suddenly O
fancying O
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
greater O
punishment O
to O
her O
partner O
to O
oblige O
him O
to O
talk O
, O
she O
made O
some O
slight O
observation O
on O
the O
dance O
. O
He O
replied O
, O
and O
was O
silent O
again O
. O
After O
a O
pause O
of O
some O
minutes O
she O
addressed O
him O
a O
second O
time O
with O
" O
It O
is O
your O
turn O
to O
say O
something O
now O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy.—I O
talked O
about O
the O
dance O
, O
and O
you O
ought O
to O
make O
some O
kind O
of O
remark O
on O
the O
size O
of O
the O
room O
, O
or O
the O
number O
of O
couples O
. O
" O
He O
smiled O
, O
and O
assured O
her O
that O
whatever O
she O
wished O
him O
to O
say O
should O
be O
said O
. O
" O
Very O
well.—That O
reply O
will O
do O
for O
the O
present.—Perhaps O
by O
and O
bye O
I O
may O
observe O
that O
private O
balls O
are O
much O
pleasanter O
than O
public O
ones.—But O
now O
we O
may O
be O
silent O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
talk O
by O
rule O
then O
, O
while O
you O
are O
dancing O
? O
" O
" O
Sometimes O
. O
One O
must O
speak O
a O
little O
, O
you O
know O
. O
It O
would O
look O
odd O
to O
be O
entirely O
silent O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
together O
, O
and O
yet O
for O
the O
advantage O
of O
some O
, O
conversation O
ought O
to O
be O
so O
arranged O
as O
that O
they O
may O
have O
the O
trouble O
of O
saying O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
consulting O
your O
own O
feelings O
in O
the O
present O
case O
, O
or O
do O
you O
imagine O
that O
you O
are O
gratifying O
mine O
? O
" O
" O
Both O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
archly O
; O
" O
for O
I O
have O
always O
seen O
a O
great O
similarity O
in O
the O
turn O
of O
our O
minds.—We O
are O
each O
of O
an O
unsocial O
, O
taciturn O
disposition O
, O
unwilling O
to O
speak O
, O
unless O
we O
expect O
to O
say O
something O
that O
will O
amaze O
the O
whole O
room O
, O
and O
be O
handed O
down O
to O
posterity O
with O
all O
the O
eclat O
of O
a O
proverb O
. O
" O
" O
This O
is O
no O
very O
striking O
resemblance O
of O
your O
own O
character O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
How O
near O
it O
may O
be O
to O
mine O
, O
I O
can O
not O
pretend O
to O
say.—You O
think O
it O
a O
faithful O
portrait O
undoubtedly O
. O
" O
" O
I O
must O
not O
decide O
on O
my O
own O
performance O
. O
" O
He O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
they O
were O
again O
silent O
till O
they O
had O
gone O
down O
the O
dance O
, O
when O
he O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
and O
her O
sisters O
did O
not O
very O
often O
walk O
to O
Meryton O
. O
She O
answered O
in O
the O
affirmative O
, O
and O
, O
unable O
to O
resist O
the O
temptation O
, O
added O
, O
" O
When O
you O
met O
us O
there O
the O
other O
day O
, O
we O
had O
just O
been O
forming O
a O
new O
acquaintance O
. O
" O
The O
effect O
was O
immediate O
. O
A O
deeper O
shade O
of O
hauteur O
overspread O
his O
features O
, O
but O
he O
said O
not O
a O
word O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
though O
blaming O
herself O
for O
her O
own O
weakness O
, O
could O
not O
go O
on O
. O
At O
length O
Darcy O
spoke O
, O
and O
in O
a O
constrained O
manner O
said O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Wickham O
is O
blessed O
with O
such O
happy O
manners O
as O
may O
ensure O
his O
making O
friends—whether O
he O
may O
be O
equally O
capable O
of O
retaining O
them O
, O
is O
less O
certain O
. O
" O
" O
He O
has O
been O
so O
unlucky O
as O
to O
lose O
your O
friendship O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
with O
emphasis O
, O
" O
and O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
he O
is O
likely O
to O
suffer O
from O
all O
his O
life O
. O
" O
Darcy O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
seemed O
desirous O
of O
changing O
the O
subject O
. O
At O
that O
moment O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
appeared O
close O
to O
them O
, O
meaning O
to O
pass O
through O
the O
set O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
room O
; O
but O
on O
perceiving O
Mr. O
Darcy O
he O
stopt O
with O
a O
bow O
of O
superior O
courtesy O
to O
compliment O
him O
on O
his O
dancing O
and O
his O
partner O
. O
" O
I O
have O
been O
most O
highly O
gratified O
indeed O
, O
my O
dear O
Sir O
. O
Such O
very O
superior O
dancing O
is O
not O
often O
seen O
. O
It O
is O
evident O
that O
you O
belong O
to O
the O
first O
circles O
. O
Allow O
me O
to O
say O
, O
however O
, O
that O
your O
fair O
partner O
does O
not O
disgrace O
you O
, O
and O
that O
I O
must O
hope O
to O
have O
this O
pleasure O
often O
repeated O
, O
especially O
when O
a O
certain O
desirable O
event O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Eliza O
, O
( O
glancing O
at O
her O
sister O
and O
Bingley O
, O
) O
shall O
take O
place O
. O
What O
congratulations O
will O
then O
flow O
in O
! O
I O
appeal O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
: O
—but O
let O
me O
not O
interrupt O
you O
, O
Sir.—You O
will O
not O
thank O
me O
for O
detaining O
you O
from O
the O
bewitching O
converse O
of O
that O
young O
lady O
, O
whose O
bright O
eyes O
are O
also O
upbraiding O
me O
. O
" O
The O
latter O
part O
of O
this O
address O
was O
scarcely O
heard O
by O
Darcy O
; O
but O
Sir O
William O
's O
allusion O
to O
his O
friend O
seemed O
to O
strike O
him O
forcibly O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
were O
directed O
with O
a O
very O
serious O
expression O
towards O
Bingley O
and O
Jane O
, O
who O
were O
dancing O
together O
. O
Recovering O
himself O
, O
however O
, O
shortly O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
his O
partner O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Sir O
William O
's O
interruption O
has O
made O
me O
forget O
what O
we O
were O
talking O
of O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
think O
we O
were O
speaking O
at O
all O
. O
Sir O
William O
could O
not O
have O
interrupted O
any O
two O
people O
in O
the O
room O
who O
had O
less O
to O
say O
for O
themselves.—We O
have O
tried O
two O
or O
three O
subjects O
already O
without O
success O
, O
and O
what O
we O
are O
to O
talk O
of O
next O
I O
can O
not O
imagine O
. O
" O
" O
What O
think O
you O
of O
books O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
Books—Oh O
! O
no.—I O
am O
sure O
we O
never O
read O
the O
same O
, O
or O
not O
with O
the O
same O
feelings O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
you O
think O
so O
; O
but O
if O
that O
be O
the O
case O
, O
there O
can O
at O
least O
be O
no O
want O
of O
subject.—We O
may O
compare O
our O
different O
opinions O
. O
" O
" O
No—I O
can O
not O
talk O
of O
books O
in O
a O
ball-room O
; O
my O
head O
is O
always O
full O
of O
something O
else O
. O
" O
" O
The O
present O
always O
occupies O
you O
in O
such O
scenes—does O
it O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
a O
look O
of O
doubt O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
always O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
without O
knowing O
what O
she O
said O
, O
for O
her O
thoughts O
had O
wandered O
far O
from O
the O
subject O
, O
as O
soon O
afterwards O
appeared O
by O
her O
suddenly O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
I O
remember O
hearing O
you O
once O
say O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
that O
you O
hardly O
ever O
forgave O
, O
that O
your O
resentment O
once O
created O
was O
unappeasable O
. O
You O
are O
very O
cautious O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
as O
to O
its O
being O
created O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
with O
a O
firm O
voice O
. O
" O
And O
never O
allow O
yourself O
to O
be O
blinded O
by O
prejudice O
? O
" O
" O
I O
hope O
not O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
particularly O
incumbent O
on O
those O
who O
never O
change O
their O
opinion O
, O
to O
be O
secure O
of O
judging O
properly O
at O
first O
. O
" O
" O
May O
I O
ask O
to O
what O
these O
questions O
tend O
? O
" O
" O
Merely O
to O
the O
illustration O
of O
your O
character O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
endeavouring O
to O
shake O
off O
her O
gravity O
. O
" O
I O
am O
trying O
to O
make O
it O
out O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
is O
your O
success O
? O
" O
She O
shook O
her O
head O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
get O
on O
at O
all O
. O
I O
hear O
such O
different O
accounts O
of O
you O
as O
puzzle O
me O
exceedingly O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
readily O
believe O
, O
" O
answered O
he O
gravely O
, O
" O
that O
report O
may O
vary O
greatly O
with O
respect O
to O
me O
; O
and O
I O
could O
wish O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
that O
you O
were O
not O
to O
sketch O
my O
character O
at O
the O
present O
moment O
, O
as O
there O
is O
reason O
to O
fear O
that O
the O
performance O
would O
reflect O
no O
credit O
on O
either O
. O
" O
" O
But O
if O
I O
do O
not O
take O
your O
likeness O
now O
, O
I O
may O
never O
have O
another O
opportunity O
. O
" O
" O
I O
would O
by O
no O
means O
suspend O
any O
pleasure O
of O
yours O
, O
" O
he O
coldly O
replied O
. O
She O
said O
no O
more O
, O
and O
they O
went O
down O
the O
other O
dance O
and O
parted O
in O
silence O
; O
on O
each O
side O
dissatisfied O
, O
though O
not O
to O
an O
equal O
degree O
, O
for O
in O
Darcy O
's O
breast O
there O
was O
a O
tolerable O
powerful O
feeling O
towards O
her O
, O
which O
soon O
procured O
her O
pardon O
, O
and O
directed O
all O
his O
anger O
against O
another O
. O
They O
had O
not O
long O
separated O
when O
Miss O
Bingley O
came O
towards O
her O
, O
and O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
civil O
disdain O
thus O
accosted O
her O
, O
" O
So O
, O
Miss O
Eliza O
, O
I O
hear O
you O
are O
quite O
delighted O
with O
George O
Wickham O
! O
—Your O
sister O
has O
been O
talking O
to O
me O
about O
him O
, O
and O
asking O
me O
a O
thousand O
questions O
; O
and O
I O
find O
that O
the O
young O
man O
forgot O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
among O
his O
other O
communications O
, O
that O
he O
was O
the O
son O
of O
old O
Wickham O
, O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
steward O
. O
Let O
me O
recommend O
you O
, O
however O
, O
as O
a O
friend O
, O
not O
to O
give O
implicit O
confidence O
to O
all O
his O
assertions O
; O
for O
as O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
using O
him O
ill O
, O
it O
is O
perfectly O
false O
; O
for O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
has O
been O
always O
remarkably O
kind O
to O
him O
, O
though O
George O
Wickham O
has O
treated O
Mr. O
Darcy O
in O
a O
most O
infamous O
manner O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
particulars O
, O
but O
I O
know O
very O
well O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
not O
in O
the O
least O
to O
blame O
, O
that O
he O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
hear O
George O
Wickham O
mentioned O
, O
and O
that O
though O
my O
brother O
thought O
he O
could O
not O
well O
avoid O
including O
him O
in O
his O
invitation O
to O
the O
officers O
, O
he O
was O
excessively O
glad O
to O
find O
that O
he O
had O
taken O
himself O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O
His O
coming O
into O
the O
country O
at O
all O
, O
is O
a O
most O
insolent O
thing O
indeed O
, O
and O
I O
wonder O
how O
he O
could O
presume O
to O
do O
it O
. O
I O
pity O
you O
, O
Miss O
Eliza O
, O
for O
this O
discovery O
of O
your O
favourite O
's O
guilt O
, O
but O
really O
considering O
his O
descent O
, O
one O
could O
not O
expect O
much O
better O
. O
" O
" O
His O
guilt O
and O
his O
descent O
appear O
by O
your O
account O
to O
be O
the O
same O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
angrily O
; O
" O
for O
I O
have O
heard O
you O
accuse O
him O
of O
nothing O
worse O
than O
of O
being O
the O
son O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
steward O
, O
and O
of O
that O
, O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
, O
he O
informed O
me O
himself O
. O
" O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
" O
replied O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
turning O
away O
with O
a O
sneer O
. O
" O
Excuse O
my O
interference.—It O
was O
kindly O
meant O
. O
" O
" O
Insolent O
girl O
! O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
to O
herself.— O
" O
You O
are O
much O
mistaken O
if O
you O
expect O
to O
influence O
me O
by O
such O
a O
paltry O
attack O
as O
this O
. O
I O
see O
nothing O
in O
it O
but O
your O
own O
wilful O
ignorance O
and O
the O
malice O
of O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
. O
" O
She O
then O
sought O
her O
eldest O
sister O
, O
who O
had O
undertaken O
to O
make O
inquiries O
on O
the O
same O
subject O
of O
Bingley O
. O
Jane O
met O
her O
with O
a O
smile O
of O
such O
sweet O
complacency O
, O
a O
glow O
of O
such O
happy O
expression O
, O
as O
sufficiently O
marked O
how O
well O
she O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
occurrences O
of O
the O
evening.—Elizabeth O
instantly O
read O
her O
feelings O
, O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
solicitude O
for O
Wickham O
, O
resentment O
against O
his O
enemies O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
else O
gave O
way O
before O
the O
hope O
of O
Jane O
's O
being O
in O
the O
fairest O
way O
for O
happiness O
. O
" O
I O
want O
to O
know O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
with O
a O
countenance O
no O
less O
smiling O
than O
her O
sister O
's O
, O
" O
what O
you O
have O
learnt O
about O
Mr. O
Wickham O
. O
But O
perhaps O
you O
have O
been O
too O
pleasantly O
engaged O
to O
think O
of O
any O
third O
person O
; O
in O
which O
case O
you O
may O
be O
sure O
of O
my O
pardon O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
replied O
Jane O
, O
" O
I O
have O
not O
forgotten O
him O
; O
but O
I O
have O
nothing O
satisfactory O
to O
tell O
you O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
does O
not O
know O
the O
whole O
of O
his O
history O
, O
and O
is O
quite O
ignorant O
of O
the O
circumstances O
which O
have O
principally O
offended O
Mr. O
Darcy O
; O
but O
he O
will O
vouch O
for O
the O
good O
conduct O
, O
the O
probity O
and O
honour O
of O
his O
friend O
, O
and O
is O
perfectly O
convinced O
that O
Mr. O
Wickham O
has O
deserved O
much O
less O
attention O
from O
Mr. O
Darcy O
than O
he O
has O
received O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
that O
by O
his O
account O
as O
well O
as O
his O
sister O
's O
, O
Mr. O
Wickham O
is O
by O
no O
means O
a O
respectable O
young O
man O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
he O
has O
been O
very O
imprudent O
, O
and O
has O
deserved O
to O
lose O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
regard O
. O
" O
" O
Mr. O
Bingley O
does O
not O
know O
Mr. O
Wickham O
himself O
? O
" O
" O
No O
; O
he O
never O
saw O
him O
till O
the O
other O
morning O
at O
Meryton O
. O
" O
" O
This O
account O
then O
is O
what O
he O
has O
received O
from O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
I O
am O
perfectly O
satisfied O
. O
But O
what O
does O
he O
say O
of O
the O
living O
? O
" O
" O
He O
does O
not O
exactly O
recollect O
the O
circumstances O
, O
though O
he O
has O
heard O
them O
from O
Mr. O
Darcy O
more O
than O
once O
, O
but O
he O
believes O
that O
it O
was O
left O
to O
him O
conditionally O
only O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
not O
a O
doubt O
of O
Mr. O
Bing- O
ley O
's O
sincerity O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
warmly O
; O
" O
but O
you O
must O
excuse O
my O
not O
being O
convinced O
by O
assurances O
only O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
defence O
of O
his O
friend O
was O
a O
very O
able O
one O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
but O
since O
he O
is O
unacquainted O
with O
several O
parts O
of O
the O
story O
, O
and O
has O
learnt O
the O
rest O
from O
that O
friend O
himself O
, O
I O
shall O
venture O
still O
to O
think O
of O
both O
gentlemen O
as O
I O
did O
before O
. O
" O
She O
then O
changed O
the O
discourse O
to O
one O
more O
gratifying O
to O
each O
, O
and O
on O
which O
there O
could O
be O
no O
difference O
of O
sentiment O
. O
Elizabeth O
listened O
with O
delight O
to O
the O
happy O
, O
though O
modest O
hopes O
which O
Jane O
entertained O
of O
Bingley O
's O
regard O
, O
and O
said O
all O
in O
her O
power O
to O
heighten O
her O
confidence O
in O
it O
. O
On O
their O
being O
joined O
by O
Mr. O
Bingley O
himself O
, O
Elizabeth O
withdrew O
to O
Miss O
Lucas O
; O
to O
whose O
inquiry O
after O
the O
pleasantness O
of O
her O
last O
partner O
she O
had O
scarcely O
replied O
, O
before O
Mr. O
Collins O
came O
up O
to O
them O
and O
told O
her O
with O
great O
exultation O
that O
he O
had O
just O
been O
so O
fortunate O
as O
to O
make O
a O
most O
important O
discovery O
. O
" O
I O
have O
found O
out O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
by O
a O
singular O
accident O
, O
that O
there O
is O
now O
in O
the O
room O
a O
near O
relation O
of O
my O
patroness O
. O
I O
happened O
to O
overhear O
the O
gentleman O
himself O
mentioning O
to O
the O
young O
lady O
who O
does O
the O
honours O
of O
this O
house O
the O
names O
of O
his O
cousin O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
and O
of O
her O
mother O
Lady O
Catherine O
. O
How O
wonderfully O
these O
sort O
of O
things O
occur O
! O
Who O
would O
have O
thought O
of O
my O
meeting O
with—perhaps—a O
nephew O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
in O
this O
assembly O
! O
—I O
am O
most O
thankful O
that O
the O
discovery O
is O
made O
in O
time O
for O
me O
to O
pay O
my O
respects O
to O
him O
, O
which O
I O
am O
now O
going O
to O
do O
, O
and O
trust O
he O
will O
excuse O
my O
not O
having O
done O
it O
before O
. O
My O
total O
ignorance O
of O
the O
connection O
must O
plead O
my O
apology O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
not O
going O
to O
introduce O
yourself O
to O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
? O
" O
" O
Indeed O
I O
am O
. O
I O
shall O
intreat O
his O
pardon O
for O
not O
having O
done O
it O
earlier O
. O
I O
believe O
him O
to O
be O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
nephew O
. O
It O
will O
be O
in O
my O
power O
to O
assure O
him O
that O
her O
ladyship O
was O
quite O
well O
yesterday O
se'nnight O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
tried O
hard O
to O
dissuade O
him O
from O
such O
a O
scheme O
; O
assuring O
him O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
would O
consider O
his O
addressing O
him O
without O
introduction O
as O
an O
impertinent O
freedom O
, O
rather O
than O
a O
compliment O
to O
his O
aunt O
; O
that O
it O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
necessary O
there O
should O
be O
any O
notice O
on O
either O
side O
, O
and O
that O
if O
it O
were O
, O
it O
must O
belong O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
the O
superior O
in O
consequence O
, O
to O
begin O
the O
acquaintance.—Mr O
. O
Collins O
listened O
to O
her O
with O
the O
determined O
air O
of O
following O
his O
own O
inclination O
, O
and O
when O
she O
ceased O
speaking O
, O
replied O
thus O
, O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
, O
I O
have O
the O
highest O
opinion O
in O
the O
world O
of O
your O
excellent O
judgment O
in O
all O
matters O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
your O
understanding O
, O
but O
permit O
me O
to O
say O
that O
there O
must O
be O
a O
wide O
difference O
between O
the O
established O
forms O
of O
ceremony O
amongst O
the O
laity O
, O
and O
those O
which O
regulate O
the O
clergy O
; O
for O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
observe O
that O
I O
consider O
the O
clerical O
office O
as O
equal O
in O
point O
of O
dignity O
with O
the O
highest O
rank O
in O
the O
kingdom—provided O
that O
a O
proper O
humility O
of O
behaviour O
is O
at O
the O
same O
time O
maintained O
. O
You O
must O
therefore O
allow O
me O
to O
follow O
the O
dictates O
of O
my O
conscience O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
which O
leads O
me O
to O
perform O
what O
I O
look O
on O
as O
a O
point O
of O
duty O
. O
Pardon O
me O
for O
neglecting O
to O
profit O
by O
your O
advice O
, O
which O
on O
every O
other O
subject O
shall O
be O
my O
constant O
guide O
, O
though O
in O
the O
case O
before O
us O
I O
consider O
myself O
more O
fitted O
by O
education O
and O
habitual O
study O
to O
decide O
on O
what O
is O
right O
than O
a O
young O
lady O
like O
yourself O
. O
" O
And O
with O
a O
low O
bow O
he O
left O
her O
to O
attack O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
whose O
reception O
of O
his O
advances O
she O
eagerly O
watched O
, O
and O
whose O
astonishment O
at O
being O
so O
addressed O
was O
very O
evident O
. O
Her O
cousin O
prefaced O
his O
speech O
with O
a O
solemn O
bow O
, O
and O
though O
she O
could O
not O
hear O
a O
word O
of O
it O
, O
she O
felt O
as O
if O
hearing O
it O
all O
, O
and O
saw O
in O
the O
motion O
of O
his O
lips O
the O
words O
" O
apology O
, O
" O
" O
Hunsford O
, O
" O
and O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
. O
" O
—It O
vexed O
her O
to O
see O
him O
expose O
himself O
to O
such O
a O
man O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
eyeing O
him O
with O
unrestrained O
wonder O
, O
and O
when O
at O
last O
Mr. O
Collins O
allowed O
him O
time O
to O
speak O
, O
replied O
with O
an O
air O
of O
distant O
civility O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
discouraged O
from O
speaking O
again O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
contempt O
seemed O
abundantly O
increasing O
with O
the O
length O
of O
his O
second O
speech O
, O
and O
at O
the O
end O
of O
it O
he O
only O
made O
him O
a O
slight O
bow O
, O
and O
moved O
another O
way O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
then O
returned O
to O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
I O
have O
no O
reason O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
to O
be O
dissatisfied O
with O
my O
reception O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
seemed O
much O
pleased O
with O
the O
attention O
. O
He O
answered O
me O
with O
the O
utmost O
civility O
, O
and O
even O
paid O
me O
the O
compliment O
of O
saying O
, O
that O
he O
was O
so O
well O
convinced O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
discernment O
as O
to O
be O
certain O
she O
could O
never O
bestow O
a O
favour O
unworthily O
. O
It O
was O
really O
a O
very O
handsome O
thought O
. O
Upon O
the O
whole O
, O
I O
am O
much O
pleased O
with O
him O
. O
" O
As O
Elizabeth O
had O
no O
longer O
any O
interest O
of O
her O
own O
to O
pursue O
, O
she O
turned O
her O
attention O
almost O
entirely O
on O
her O
sister O
and O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
and O
the O
train O
of O
agreeable O
reflections O
which O
her O
observations O
gave O
birth O
to O
, O
made O
her O
perhaps O
almost O
as O
happy O
as O
Jane O
. O
She O
saw O
her O
in O
idea O
settled O
in O
that O
very O
house O
in O
all O
the O
felicity O
which O
a O
marriage O
of O
true O
affection O
could O
bestow O
; O
and O
she O
felt O
capable O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
of O
endeavouring O
even O
to O
like O
Bingley O
's O
two O
sisters O
. O
Her O
mother O
's O
thoughts O
she O
plainly O
saw O
were O
bent O
the O
same O
way O
, O
and O
she O
determined O
not O
to O
venture O
near O
her O
, O
lest O
she O
might O
hear O
too O
much O
. O
When O
they O
sat O
down O
to O
supper O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
considered O
it O
a O
most O
unlucky O
perverseness O
which O
placed O
them O
within O
one O
of O
each O
other O
; O
and O
deeply O
was O
she O
vexed O
to O
find O
that O
her O
mother O
was O
talking O
to O
that O
one O
person O
( O
Lady O
Lucas O
) O
freely O
, O
openly O
, O
and O
of O
nothing O
else O
but O
of O
her O
expectation O
that O
Jane O
would O
be O
soon O
married O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley.—It O
was O
an O
animating O
subject O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
seemed O
incapable O
of O
fatigue O
while O
enumerating O
the O
advan- O
tages O
of O
the O
match O
. O
His O
being O
such O
a O
charming O
young O
man O
, O
and O
so O
rich O
, O
and O
living O
but O
three O
miles O
from O
them O
, O
were O
the O
first O
points O
of O
self-gratulation O
; O
and O
then O
it O
was O
such O
a O
comfort O
to O
think O
how O
fond O
the O
two O
sisters O
were O
of O
Jane O
, O
and O
to O
be O
certain O
that O
they O
must O
desire O
the O
connection O
as O
much O
as O
she O
could O
do O
. O
It O
was O
, O
moreover O
, O
such O
a O
promising O
thing O
for O
her O
younger O
daughters O
, O
as O
Jane O
's O
marrying O
so O
greatly O
must O
throw O
them O
in O
the O
way O
of O
other O
rich O
men O
; O
and O
lastly O
, O
it O
was O
so O
pleasant O
at O
her O
time O
of O
life O
to O
be O
able O
to O
consign O
her O
single O
daughters O
to O
the O
care O
of O
their O
sister O
, O
that O
she O
might O
not O
be O
obliged O
to O
go O
into O
company O
more O
than O
she O
liked O
. O
It O
was O
necessary O
to O
make O
this O
circumstance O
a O
matter O
of O
pleasure O
, O
because O
on O
such O
occasions O
it O
is O
the O
etiquette O
; O
but O
no O
one O
was O
less O
likely O
than O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
to O
find O
comfort O
in O
staying O
at O
home O
at O
any O
period O
of O
her O
life O
. O
She O
concluded O
with O
many O
good O
wishes O
that O
Lady O
Lucas O
might O
soon O
be O
equally O
fortunate O
, O
though O
evidently O
and O
triumphantly O
believing O
there O
was O
no O
chance O
of O
it O
. O
In O
vain O
did O
Elizabeth O
endeavour O
to O
check O
the O
rapidity O
of O
her O
mother O
's O
words O
, O
or O
persuade O
her O
to O
describe O
her O
felicity O
in O
a O
less O
audible O
whisper O
; O
for O
to O
her O
inexpressible O
vexation O
, O
she O
could O
perceive O
that O
the O
chief O
of O
it O
was O
overheard O
by O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
who O
sat O
opposite O
to O
them O
. O
Her O
mother O
only O
scolded O
her O
for O
being O
nonsensical O
. O
" O
What O
is O
Mr. O
Darcy O
to O
me O
, O
pray O
, O
that O
I O
should O
be O
afraid O
of O
him O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
we O
owe O
him O
no O
such O
particular O
civility O
as O
to O
be O
obliged O
to O
say O
nothing O
he O
may O
not O
like O
to O
hear O
. O
" O
" O
For O
heaven O
's O
sake O
, O
madam O
, O
speak O
lower.—What O
advantage O
can O
it O
be O
to O
you O
to O
offend O
Mr. O
Darcy O
? O
—You O
will O
never O
recommend O
yourself O
to O
his O
friend O
by O
so O
doing O
. O
" O
Nothing O
that O
she O
could O
say O
, O
however O
, O
had O
any O
influence O
. O
Her O
mother O
would O
talk O
of O
her O
views O
in O
the O
same O
intelligible O
tone O
. O
Elizabeth O
blushed O
and O
blushed O
again O
with O
shame O
and O
vexation O
. O
She O
could O
not O
help O
frequently O
glancing O
her O
eye O
at O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
though O
every O
glance O
convinced O
her O
of O
what O
she O
dreaded O
; O
for O
though O
he O
was O
not O
always O
looking O
at O
her O
mother O
, O
she O
was O
convinced O
that O
his O
attention O
was O
invariably O
fixed O
by O
her O
. O
The O
expression O
of O
his O
face O
changed O
gradually O
from O
indignant O
contempt O
to O
a O
composed O
and O
steady O
gravity O
. O
At O
length O
however O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
no O
more O
to O
say O
; O
and O
Lady O
Lucas O
, O
who O
had O
been O
long O
yawning O
at O
the O
repetition O
of O
delights O
which O
she O
saw O
no O
likelihood O
of O
sharing O
, O
was O
left O
to O
the O
comforts O
of O
cold O
ham O
and O
chicken O
. O
Elizabeth O
now O
began O
to O
revive O
. O
But O
not O
long O
was O
the O
interval O
of O
tranquillity O
; O
for O
when O
supper O
was O
over O
, O
singing O
was O
talked O
of O
, O
and O
she O
had O
the O
mortification O
of O
seeing O
Mary O
, O
after O
very O
little O
entreaty O
, O
preparing O
to O
oblige O
the O
company O
. O
By O
many O
significant O
looks O
and O
silent O
entreaties O
, O
did O
she O
endeavour O
to O
prevent O
such O
a O
proof O
of O
complaisance O
, O
—but O
in O
vain O
; O
Mary O
would O
not O
understand O
them O
; O
such O
an O
opportunity O
of O
exhibiting O
was O
delightful O
to O
her O
, O
and O
she O
began O
her O
song O
. O
Elizabeth O
's O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
her O
with O
most O
painful O
sensations O
; O
and O
she O
watched O
her O
progress O
through O
the O
several O
stanzas O
with O
an O
impatience O
which O
was O
very O
ill O
rewarded O
at O
their O
close O
; O
for O
Mary O
, O
on O
receiving O
amongst O
the O
thanks O
of O
the O
table O
, O
the O
hint O
of O
a O
hope O
that O
she O
might O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
favour O
them O
again O
, O
after O
the O
pause O
of O
half O
a O
minute O
began O
another O
. O
Mary O
's O
powers O
were O
by O
no O
means O
fitted O
for O
such O
a O
display O
; O
her O
voice O
was O
weak O
, O
and O
her O
manner O
affected.—Elizabeth O
was O
in O
agonies O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
Jane O
, O
to O
see O
how O
she O
bore O
it O
; O
but O
Jane O
was O
very O
composedly O
talking O
to O
Bingley O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
his O
two O
sisters O
, O
and O
saw O
them O
making O
signs O
of O
derision O
at O
each O
other O
, O
and O
at O
Darcy O
, O
who O
continued O
however O
impenetrably O
grave O
. O
She O
looked O
at O
her O
father O
to O
entreat O
his O
interference O
, O
lest O
Mary O
should O
be O
singing O
all O
night O
. O
He O
took O
the O
hint O
, O
and O
when O
Mary O
had O
finished O
her O
second O
song O
, O
said O
aloud O
, O
" O
That O
will O
do O
extremely O
well O
, O
child O
. O
You O
have O
delighted O
us O
long O
enough O
. O
Let O
the O
other O
young O
ladies O
have O
time O
to O
exhibit O
. O
" O
Mary O
, O
though O
pretending O
not O
to O
hear O
, O
was O
somewhat O
disconcerted O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
sorry O
for O
her O
, O
and O
sorry O
for O
her O
father O
's O
speech O
, O
was O
afraid O
her O
anxiety O
had O
done O
no O
good.—Others O
of O
the O
party O
were O
now O
applied O
to O
. O
" O
If O
I O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
" O
were O
so O
fortunate O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
sing O
, O
I O
should O
have O
great O
pleasure O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
in O
obliging O
the O
company O
with O
an O
air O
; O
for O
I O
consider O
music O
as O
a O
very O
innocent O
diversion O
, O
and O
perfectly O
compatible O
with O
the O
profession O
of O
a O
clergyman.—I O
do O
not O
mean O
however O
to O
assert O
that O
we O
can O
be O
justified O
in O
devoting O
too O
much O
of O
our O
time O
to O
music O
, O
for O
there O
are O
certainly O
other O
things O
to O
be O
attended O
to O
. O
The O
rector O
of O
a O
parish O
has O
much O
to O
do.—In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
he O
must O
make O
such O
an O
agreement O
for O
tythes O
as O
may O
be O
beneficial O
to O
himself O
and O
not O
offensive O
to O
his O
patron O
. O
He O
must O
write O
his O
own O
sermons O
; O
and O
the O
time O
that O
remains O
will O
not O
be O
too O
much O
for O
his O
parish O
duties O
, O
and O
the O
care O
and O
improvement O
of O
his O
dwelling O
, O
which O
he O
can O
not O
be O
excused O
from O
making O
as O
comfortable O
as O
possible O
. O
And O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
of O
light O
importance O
that O
he O
should O
have O
attentive O
and O
conciliatory O
manners O
towards O
every O
body O
, O
especially O
towards O
those O
to O
whom O
he O
owes O
his O
preferment O
. O
I O
can O
not O
acquit O
him O
of O
that O
duty O
; O
nor O
could O
I O
think O
well O
of O
the O
man O
who O
should O
omit O
an O
occasion O
of O
testifying O
his O
respect O
towards O
any O
body O
connected O
with O
the O
family O
. O
" O
And O
with O
a O
bow O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
he O
concluded O
his O
speech O
, O
which O
had O
been O
spoken O
so O
loud O
as O
to O
be O
heard O
by O
half O
the O
room.—Many O
stared.—Many O
smiled O
; O
but O
no O
one O
looked O
more O
amused O
than O
Mr. O
Bennet O
himself O
, O
while O
his O
wife O
seriously O
commended O
Mr. O
Collins O
for O
having O
spoken O
so O
sensibly O
, O
and O
observed O
in O
a O
half-whisper O
to O
Lady O
Lucas O
, O
that O
he O
was O
a O
remarkably O
clever O
, O
good O
kind O
of O
young O
man O
. O
To O
Elizabeth O
it O
appeared O
, O
that O
had O
her O
family O
made O
an O
agreement O
to O
expose O
themselves O
as O
much O
as O
they O
could O
during O
the O
evening O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
impossible O
for O
them O
to O
play O
their O
parts O
with O
more O
spirit O
, O
or O
finer O
success O
; O
and O
happy O
did O
she O
think O
it O
for O
Bingley O
and O
her O
sister O
that O
some O
of O
the O
exhibition O
had O
escaped O
his O
notice O
, O
and O
that O
his O
feelings O
were O
not O
of O
a O
sort O
to O
be O
much O
distressed O
by O
the O
folly O
which O
he O
must O
have O
witnessed O
. O
That O
his O
two O
sisters O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
however O
, O
should O
have O
such O
an O
opportunity O
of O
ridiculing O
her O
relations O
was O
bad O
enough O
, O
and O
she O
could O
not O
determine O
whether O
the O
silent O
contempt O
of O
the O
gentleman O
, O
or O
the O
insolent O
smiles O
of O
the O
ladies O
, O
were O
more O
intolerable O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
brought O
her O
little O
amusement O
. O
She O
was O
teazed O
by O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
who O
continued O
most O
perseveringly O
by O
her O
side O
, O
and O
though O
he O
could O
not O
prevail O
with O
her O
to O
dance O
with O
him O
again O
, O
put O
it O
out O
of O
her O
power O
to O
dance O
with O
others O
. O
In O
vain O
did O
she O
entreat O
him O
to O
stand O
up O
with O
somebody O
else O
, O
and O
offer O
to O
introduce O
him O
to O
any O
young O
lady O
in O
the O
room O
. O
He O
assured O
her O
that O
as O
to O
dancing O
, O
he O
was O
perfectly O
indifferent O
to O
it O
; O
that O
his O
chief O
object O
was O
by O
delicate O
attentions O
to O
recommend O
himself O
to O
her O
, O
and O
that O
he O
should O
therefore O
make O
a O
point O
of O
remaining O
close O
to O
her O
the O
whole O
evening O
. O
There O
was O
no O
arguing O
upon O
such O
a O
project O
. O
She O
owed O
her O
greatest O
relief O
to O
her O
friend O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
who O
often O
joined O
them O
, O
and O
goodnaturedly O
engaged O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
conversation O
to O
herself O
. O
She O
was O
at O
least O
free O
from O
the O
offence O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
farther O
notice O
; O
though O
often O
standing O
within O
a O
very O
short O
distance O
of O
her O
, O
quite O
disengaged O
, O
he O
never O
came O
near O
enough O
to O
speak O
. O
She O
felt O
it O
to O
be O
the O
probable O
consequence O
of O
her O
allusions O
to O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
and O
rejoiced O
in O
it O
. O
The O
Longbourn O
party O
were O
the O
last O
of O
all O
the O
company O
to O
depart O
; O
and O
by O
a O
manœuvre O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
their O
carriages O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
after O
every O
body O
else O
was O
gone O
, O
which O
gave O
them O
time O
to O
see O
how O
heartily O
they O
were O
wished O
away O
by O
some O
of O
the O
family O
. O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
her O
sister O
scarcely O
opened O
their O
mouths O
except O
to O
complain O
of O
fatigue O
, O
and O
were O
evidently O
impatient O
to O
have O
the O
house O
to O
themselves O
. O
They O
repulsed O
every O
attempt O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
at O
conversation O
, O
and O
by O
so O
doing O
, O
threw O
a O
languor O
over O
the O
whole O
party O
, O
which O
was O
very O
little O
relieved O
by O
the O
long O
speeches O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
who O
was O
complimenting O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
his O
sisters O
on O
the O
elegance O
of O
their O
entertainment O
, O
and O
the O
hospitality O
and O
politeness O
which O
had O
marked O
their O
behaviour O
to O
their O
guests O
. O
Darcy O
said O
nothing O
at O
all O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
in O
equal O
silence O
, O
was O
enjoying O
the O
scene O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
Jane O
were O
standing O
together O
, O
a O
little O
detached O
from O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
talked O
only O
to O
each O
other O
. O
Elizabeth O
preserved O
as O
steady O
a O
silence O
as O
either O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
or O
Miss O
Bingley O
; O
and O
even O
Lydia O
was O
too O
much O
fatigued O
to O
utter O
more O
than O
the O
occasional O
exclamation O
of O
" O
Lord O
, O
how O
tired O
I O
am O
! O
" O
accompanied O
by O
a O
violent O
yawn O
. O
When O
at O
length O
they O
arose O
to O
take O
leave O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
most O
pressingly O
civil O
in O
her O
hope O
of O
seeing O
the O
whole O
family O
soon O
at O
Longbourn O
; O
and O
addressed O
herself O
particularly O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
to O
assure O
him O
how O
happy O
he O
would O
make O
them O
, O
by O
eating O
a O
family O
dinner O
with O
them O
at O
any O
time O
, O
without O
the O
ceremony O
of O
a O
formal O
invitation O
. O
Bingley O
was O
all O
grateful O
pleasure O
, O
and O
he O
readily O
engaged O
for O
taking O
the O
earliest O
opportunity O
of O
waiting O
on O
her O
, O
after O
his O
return O
from O
London O
, O
whither O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
go O
the O
next O
day O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
perfectly O
satisfied O
; O
and O
quitted O
the O
house O
under O
the O
delightful O
persuasion O
that O
, O
allowing O
for O
the O
necessary O
preparations O
of O
settlements O
, O
new O
carriages O
and O
wedding O
clothes O
, O
she O
should O
undoubtedly O
see O
her O
daughter O
settled O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
three O
or O
four O
months O
. O
Of O
having O
another O
daughter O
married O
to O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
she O
thought O
with O
equal O
certainty O
, O
and O
with O
considerable O
, O
though O
not O
equal O
, O
pleasure O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
the O
least O
dear O
to O
her O
of O
all O
her O
children O
; O
and O
though O
the O
man O
and O
the O
match O
were O
quite O
good O
enough O
for O
her O
, O
the O
worth O
of O
each O
was O
eclipsed O
by O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
Netherfield O
. O
