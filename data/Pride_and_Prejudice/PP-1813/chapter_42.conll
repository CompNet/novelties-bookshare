Had O
Elizabeth O
's O
opinion O
been O
all O
drawn O
from O
her O
own O
family O
, O
she O
could O
not O
have O
formed O
a O
very O
pleasing O
picture O
of O
conjugal O
felicity O
or O
domestic O
comfort O
. O
Her O
father O
captivated O
by O
youth O
and O
beauty O
, O
and O
that O
appearance O
of O
good O
humour O
, O
which O
youth O
and O
beauty O
generally O
give O
, O
had O
married O
a O
woman O
whose O
weak O
understanding O
and O
illiberal O
mind O
, O
had O
very O
early O
in O
their O
marriage O
put O
an O
end O
to O
all O
real O
affection O
for O
her O
. O
Respect O
, O
esteem O
, O
and O
confidence O
, O
had O
vanished O
for O
ever O
; O
and O
all O
his O
views O
of O
domestic O
happiness O
were O
overthrown O
. O
But O
Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
not O
of O
a O
disposition O
to O
seek O
comfort O
for O
the O
disappointment O
which O
his O
own O
imprudence O
had O
brought O
on O
, O
in O
any O
of O
those O
pleasures O
which O
too O
often O
console O
the O
unfor- O
tunate O
for O
their O
folly O
or O
their O
vice O
. O
He O
was O
fond O
of O
the O
country O
and O
of O
books O
; O
and O
from O
these O
tastes O
had O
arisen O
his O
principal O
enjoyments O
. O
To O
his O
wife O
he O
was O
very O
little O
otherwise O
indebted O
, O
than O
as O
her O
ignorance O
and O
folly O
had O
contributed O
to O
his O
amusement O
. O
This O
is O
not O
the O
sort O
of O
happiness O
which O
a O
man O
would O
in O
general O
wish O
to O
owe O
to O
his O
wife O
; O
but O
where O
other O
powers O
of O
entertainment O
are O
wanting O
, O
the O
true O
philosopher O
will O
derive O
benefit O
from O
such O
as O
are O
given O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
however O
, O
had O
never O
been O
blind O
to O
the O
impropriety O
of O
her O
father O
's O
behaviour O
as O
a O
husband O
. O
She O
had O
always O
seen O
it O
with O
pain O
; O
but O
respecting O
his O
abilities O
, O
and O
grateful O
for O
his O
affectionate O
treatment O
of O
herself O
, O
she O
endeavoured O
to O
forget O
what O
she O
could O
not O
overlook O
, O
and O
to O
banish O
from O
her O
thoughts O
that O
continual O
breach O
of O
conjugal O
obligation O
and O
decorum O
which O
, O
in O
exposing O
his O
wife O
to O
the O
contempt O
of O
her O
own O
children O
, O
was O
so O
highly O
reprehensible O
. O
But O
she O
had O
never O
felt O
so O
strongly O
as O
now O
, O
the O
disadvantages O
which O
must O
attend O
the O
children O
of O
so O
unsuitable O
a O
marriage O
, O
nor O
ever O
been O
so O
fully O
aware O
of O
the O
evils O
arising O
from O
so O
ill-judged O
a O
direction O
of O
talents O
; O
talents O
which O
rightly O
used O
, O
might O
at O
least O
have O
preserved O
the O
respectability O
of O
his O
daughters O
, O
even O
if O
incapable O
of O
enlarging O
the O
mind O
of O
his O
wife O
. O
When O
Elizabeth O
had O
rejoiced O
over O
Wickham O
's O
departure O
, O
she O
found O
little O
other O
cause O
for O
satisfaction O
in O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
regiment O
. O
Their O
parties O
abroad O
were O
less O
varied O
than O
before O
; O
and O
at O
home O
she O
had O
a O
mother O
and O
sister O
whose O
constant O
repinings O
at O
the O
dulness O
of O
every O
thing O
around O
them O
, O
threw O
a O
real O
gloom O
over O
their O
domestic O
circle O
; O
and O
, O
though O
Kitty O
might O
in O
time O
regain O
her O
natural O
degree O
of O
sense O
, O
since O
the O
dis- O
turbers O
of O
her O
brain O
were O
removed O
, O
her O
other O
sister O
, O
from O
whose O
disposition O
greater O
evil O
might O
be O
apprehended O
, O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
hardened O
in O
all O
her O
folly O
and O
assurance O
, O
by O
a O
situation O
of O
such O
double O
danger O
as O
a O
watering O
place O
and O
a O
camp O
. O
Upon O
the O
whole O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
found O
, O
what O
has O
been O
sometimes O
found O
before O
, O
that O
an O
event O
to O
which O
she O
had O
looked O
forward O
with O
impatient O
desire O
, O
did O
not O
in O
taking O
place O
, O
bring O
all O
the O
satisfaction O
she O
had O
promised O
herself O
. O
It O
was O
consequently O
necessary O
to O
name O
some O
other O
period O
for O
the O
commencement O
of O
actual O
felicity O
; O
to O
have O
some O
other O
point O
on O
which O
her O
wishes O
and O
hopes O
might O
be O
fixed O
, O
and O
by O
again O
enjoying O
the O
pleasure O
of O
anticipation O
, O
console O
herself O
for O
the O
present O
, O
and O
prepare O
for O
another O
disappointment O
. O
Her O
tour O
to O
the O
Lakes O
was O
now O
the O
object O
of O
her O
happiest O
thoughts O
; O
it O
was O
her O
best O
consolation O
for O
all O
the O
uncomfortable O
hours O
, O
which O
the O
discontentedness O
of O
her O
mother O
and O
Kitty O
made O
inevitable O
; O
and O
could O
she O
have O
included O
Jane O
in O
the O
scheme O
, O
every O
part O
of O
it O
would O
have O
been O
perfect O
. O
" O
But O
it O
is O
fortunate O
, O
" O
thought O
she O
, O
" O
that O
I O
have O
something O
to O
wish O
for O
. O
Were O
the O
whole O
arrangement O
complete O
, O
my O
disappointment O
would O
be O
certain O
. O
But O
here O
, O
my O
carrying O
with O
me O
one O
ceaseless O
source O
of O
regret O
in O
my O
sister O
's O
absence O
, O
I O
may O
reasonably O
hope O
to O
have O
all O
my O
expectations O
of O
pleasure O
realized O
. O
A O
scheme O
of O
which O
every O
part O
promises O
delight O
, O
can O
never O
be O
successful O
; O
and O
general O
disappointment O
is O
only O
warded O
off O
by O
the O
defence O
of O
some O
little O
peculiar O
vexation O
. O
" O
When O
Lydia O
went O
away O
, O
she O
promised O
to O
write O
very O
often O
and O
very O
minutely O
to O
her O
mother O
and O
Kitty O
; O
but O
her O
letters O
were O
always O
long O
expected O
, O
and O
always O
very O
short O
. O
Those O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
contained O
little O
else O
, O
than O
that O
they O
were O
just O
returned O
from O
the O
library O
, O
where O
such O
and O
such O
officers O
had O
attended O
them O
, O
and O
where O
she O
had O
seen O
such O
beautiful O
ornaments O
as O
made O
her O
quite O
wild O
; O
that O
she O
had O
a O
new O
gown O
, O
or O
a O
new O
parasol O
, O
which O
she O
would O
have O
described O
more O
fully O
, O
but O
was O
obliged O
to O
leave O
off O
in O
a O
violent O
hurry O
, O
as O
Mrs. O
Forster O
called O
her O
, O
and O
they O
were O
going O
to O
the O
camp O
; O
—and O
from O
her O
correspondence O
with O
her O
sister O
, O
there O
was O
still O
less O
to O
be O
learnt—for O
her O
letters O
to O
Kitty O
, O
though O
rather O
longer O
, O
were O
much O
too O
full O
of O
lines O
under O
the O
words O
to O
be O
made O
public O
. O
After O
the O
first O
fortnight O
or O
three O
weeks O
of O
her O
absence O
, O
health O
, O
good O
humour O
and O
cheerfulness O
began O
to O
re-appear O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
Every O
thing O
wore O
a O
happier O
aspect O
. O
The O
families O
who O
had O
been O
in O
town O
for O
the O
winter O
came O
back O
again O
, O
and O
summer O
finery O
and O
summer O
engagements O
arose O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
restored O
to O
her O
usual O
querulous O
serenity O
, O
and O
by O
the O
middle O
of O
June O
Kitty O
was O
so O
much O
recovered O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
enter O
Meryton O
without O
tears O
; O
an O
event O
of O
such O
happy O
promise O
as O
to O
make O
Elizabeth O
hope O
, O
that O
by O
the O
following O
Christmas O
, O
she O
might O
be O
so O
tolerably O
reasonable O
as O
not O
to O
mention O
an O
officer O
above O
once O
a O
day O
, O
unless O
by O
some O
cruel O
and O
malicious O
arrangement O
at O
the O
war-office O
, O
another O
regiment O
should O
be O
quartered O
in O
Meryton O
. O
The O
time O
fixed O
for O
the O
beginning O
of O
their O
Northern O
tour O
was O
now O
fast O
approaching O
; O
and O
a O
fortnight O
only O
was O
wanting O
of O
it O
, O
when O
a O
letter O
arrived O
from O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
which O
at O
once O
delayed O
its O
commencement O
and O
curtailed O
its O
extent O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
would O
be O
prevented O
by O
business O
from O
setting O
out O
till O
a O
fortnight O
later O
in O
July O
, O
and O
must O
be O
in O
London O
again O
within O
a O
month O
; O
and O
as O
that O
left O
too O
short O
a O
period O
for O
them O
to O
go O
so O
far O
, O
and O
see O
so O
much O
as O
they O
had O
proposed O
, O
or O
at O
least O
to O
see O
it O
with O
the O
leisure O
and O
comfort O
they O
had O
built O
on O
, O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
give O
up O
the O
Lakes O
, O
and O
substitute O
a O
more O
contracted O
tour O
; O
and O
, O
according O
to O
the O
present O
plan O
, O
were O
to O
go O
no O
farther O
northward O
than O
Derbyshire O
. O
In O
that O
county O
, O
there O
was O
enough O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
to O
occupy O
the O
chief O
of O
their O
three O
weeks O
; O
and O
to O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
it O
had O
a O
peculiarly O
strong O
attraction O
. O
The O
town O
where O
she O
had O
formerly O
passed O
some O
years O
of O
her O
life O
, O
and O
where O
they O
were O
now O
to O
spend O
a O
few O
days O
, O
was O
probably O
as O
great O
an O
object O
of O
her O
curiosity O
, O
as O
all O
the O
celebrated O
beauties O
of O
Matlock O
, O
Chatsworth O
, O
Dovedale O
, O
or O
the O
Peak O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
excessively O
disappointed O
; O
she O
had O
set O
her O
heart O
on O
seeing O
the O
Lakes O
; O
and O
still O
thought O
there O
might O
have O
been O
time O
enough O
. O
But O
it O
was O
her O
business O
to O
be O
satisfied—and O
certainly O
her O
temper O
to O
be O
happy O
; O
and O
all O
was O
soon O
right O
again O
. O
With O
the O
mention O
of O
Derbyshire O
, O
there O
were O
many O
ideas O
connected O
. O
It O
was O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
see O
the O
word O
without O
thinking O
of O
Pemberley O
and O
its O
owner O
. O
" O
But O
surely O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
may O
enter O
his O
county O
with O
impunity O
, O
and O
rob O
it O
of O
a O
few O
petrified O
spars O
without O
his O
perceiving O
me O
. O
" O
The O
period O
of O
expectation O
was O
now O
doubled O
. O
Four O
weeks O
were O
to O
pass O
away O
before O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
's O
arrival O
. O
But O
they O
did O
pass O
away O
, O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
with O
their O
four O
children O
, O
did O
at O
length O
appear O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
The O
children O
, O
two O
girls O
of O
six O
and O
eight O
years O
old O
, O
and O
two O
younger O
boys O
, O
were O
to O
be O
left O
under O
the O
particular O
care O
of O
their O
cousin O
Jane O
, O
who O
was O
the O
general O
favourite O
, O
and O
whose O
steady O
sense O
and O
sweetness O
of O
temper O
exactly O
adapted O
her O
for O
attending O
to O
them O
in O
every O
way—teaching O
them O
, O
playing O
with O
them O
, O
and O
loving O
them O
. O
The O
Gardiners O
staid O
only O
one O
night O
at O
Longbourn O
, O
and O
set O
off O
the O
next O
morning O
with O
Elizabeth O
in O
pursuit O
of O
novelty O
and O
amusement O
. O
One O
enjoyment O
was O
certain—that O
of O
suitableness O
as O
companions O
; O
a O
suitableness O
which O
comprehended O
health O
and O
temper O
to O
bear O
inconveniences—cheerfulness O
to O
enhance O
every O
pleasure—and O
affection O
and O
intelligence O
, O
which O
might O
supply O
it O
among O
themselves O
if O
there O
were O
disappointments O
abroad O
. O
It O
is O
not O
the O
object O
of O
this O
work O
to O
give O
a O
description O
of O
Derbyshire O
, O
nor O
of O
any O
of O
the O
remarkable O
places O
through O
which O
their O
route O
thither O
lay O
; O
Oxford O
, O
Blenheim O
, O
Warwick O
, O
Kenelworth O
, O
Birmingham O
, O
& O
c. O
are O
sufficiently O
known O
. O
A O
small O
part O
of O
Derbyshire O
is O
all O
the O
present O
concern O
. O
To O
the O
little O
town O
of O
Lambton O
, O
the O
scene O
of O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
's O
former O
residence O
, O
and O
where O
she O
had O
lately O
learned O
that O
some O
acquaintance O
still O
remained O
, O
they O
bent O
their O
steps O
, O
after O
having O
seen O
all O
the O
principal O
wonders O
of O
the O
country O
; O
and O
within O
five O
miles O
of O
Lambton O
, O
Elizabeth O
found O
from O
her O
aunt O
, O
that O
Pemberley O
was O
situated O
. O
It O
was O
not O
in O
their O
direct O
road O
, O
nor O
more O
than O
a O
mile O
or O
two O
out O
of O
it O
. O
In O
talking O
over O
their O
route O
the O
evening O
before O
, O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
expressed O
an O
inclination O
to O
see O
the O
place O
again O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
declared O
his O
willingness O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
applied O
to O
for O
her O
approbation O
. O
" O
My O
love O
, O
should O
not O
you O
like O
to O
see O
a O
place O
of O
which O
you O
have O
heard O
so O
much O
? O
" O
said O
her O
aunt O
. O
" O
A O
place O
too O
, O
with O
which O
so O
many O
of O
your O
acquaintance O
are O
connected O
. O
Wickham O
passed O
all O
his O
youth O
there O
, O
you O
know O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
distressed O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
no O
business O
at O
Pemberley O
, O
and O
was O
obliged O
to O
assume O
a O
disinclination O
for O
seeing O
it O
. O
She O
must O
own O
that O
she O
was O
tired O
of O
great O
houses O
; O
after O
going O
over O
so O
many O
, O
she O
really O
had O
no O
pleasure O
in O
fine O
carpets O
or O
satin O
curtains O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
abused O
her O
stupidity O
. O
" O
If O
it O
were O
merely O
a O
fine O
house O
richly O
furnished O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
should O
not O
care O
about O
it O
myself O
; O
but O
the O
grounds O
are O
delightful O
. O
They O
have O
some O
of O
the O
finest O
woods O
in O
the O
country O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
said O
no O
more—but O
her O
mind O
could O
not O
acquiesce O
. O
The O
possibility O
of O
meeting O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
while O
viewing O
the O
place O
, O
instantly O
occurred O
. O
It O
would O
be O
dreadful O
! O
She O
blushed O
at O
the O
very O
idea O
; O
and O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
better O
to O
speak O
openly O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
than O
to O
run O
such O
a O
risk O
. O
But O
against O
this O
, O
there O
were O
objections O
; O
and O
she O
finally O
resolved O
that O
it O
could O
be O
the O
last O
resource O
, O
if O
her O
private O
enquiries O
as O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
family O
, O
were O
unfavourably O
answered O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
when O
she O
retired O
at O
night O
, O
she O
asked O
the O
chambermaid O
whether O
Pemberley O
were O
not O
a O
very O
fine O
place O
, O
what O
was O
the O
name O
of O
its O
proprietor O
, O
and O
with O
no O
little O
alarm O
, O
whether O
the O
family O
were O
down O
for O
the O
