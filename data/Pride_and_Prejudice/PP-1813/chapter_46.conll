Elizabeth O
had O
been O
a O
good O
deal O
disappointed O
in O
not O
finding O
a O
letter O
from O
Jane O
, O
on O
their O
first O
arrival O
at O
Lambton O
; O
and O
this O
disappointment O
had O
been O
renewed O
on O
each O
of O
the O
mornings O
that O
had O
now O
been O
spent O
there O
; O
but O
on O
the O
third O
, O
her O
repining O
was O
over O
, O
and O
her O
sister O
justified O
by O
the O
receipt O
of O
two O
letters O
from O
her O
at O
once O
, O
on O
one O
of O
which O
was O
marked O
that O
it O
had O
been O
missent O
elsewhere O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
not O
surprised O
at O
it O
, O
as O
Jane O
had O
written O
the O
direction O
remarkably O
ill O
. O
They O
had O
just O
been O
preparing O
to O
walk O
as O
the O
letters O
came O
in O
; O
and O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
leaving O
her O
to O
enjoy O
them O
in O
quiet O
, O
set O
off O
by O
themselves O
. O
The O
one O
missent O
must O
be O
first O
attended O
to O
; O
it O
had O
been O
written O
five O
days O
ago O
. O
The O
beginning O
contained O
an O
account O
of O
all O
their O
little O
parties O
and O
engagements O
, O
with O
such O
news O
as O
the O
country O
afforded O
; O
but O
the O
latter O
half O
, O
which O
was O
dated O
a O
day O
later O
, O
and O
written O
in O
evident O
agitation O
, O
gave O
more O
important O
intelligence O
. O
It O
was O
to O
this O
effect O
: O
" O
Since O
writing O
the O
above O
, O
dearest O
Lizzy O
, O
something O
has O
occurred O
of O
a O
most O
unexpected O
and O
serious O
nature O
; O
but O
I O
am O
afraid O
of O
alarming O
you—be O
assured O
that O
we O
are O
all O
well O
. O
What O
I O
have O
to O
say O
relates O
to O
poor O
Lydia O
. O
An O
express O
came O
at O
twelve O
last O
night O
, O
just O
as O
we O
were O
all O
gone O
to O
bed O
, O
from O
Colonel O
Forster O
, O
to O
inform O
us O
that O
she O
was O
gone O
off O
to O
Scotland O
with O
one O
of O
his O
officers O
; O
to O
own O
the O
truth O
, O
with O
Wickham O
! O
—Imagine O
our O
surprise O
. O
To O
Kitty O
, O
however O
, O
it O
does O
not O
seem O
so O
wholly O
unexpected O
. O
I O
am O
very O
, O
very O
sorry O
. O
So O
imprudent O
a O
match O
on O
both O
sides O
! O
—But O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
hope O
the O
best O
, O
and O
that O
his O
character O
has O
been O
misunderstood O
. O
Thoughtless O
and O
indiscreet O
I O
can O
easily O
believe O
him O
, O
but O
this O
step O
( O
and O
let O
us O
rejoice O
over O
it O
) O
marks O
nothing O
bad O
at O
heart O
. O
His O
choice O
is O
disinterested O
at O
least O
, O
for O
he O
must O
know O
my O
father O
can O
give O
her O
nothing O
. O
Our O
poor O
mother O
is O
sadly O
grieved O
. O
My O
father O
bears O
it O
better O
. O
How O
thankful O
am O
I O
, O
that O
we O
never O
let O
them O
know O
what O
has O
been O
said O
against O
him O
; O
we O
must O
forget O
it O
ourselves O
. O
They O
were O
off O
Saturday O
night O
about O
twelve O
, O
as O
is O
conjectured O
, O
but O
were O
not O
missed O
till O
yesterday O
morning O
at O
eight O
. O
The O
express O
was O
sent O
off O
directly O
. O
My O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
they O
must O
have O
passed O
within O
ten O
miles O
of O
us O
. O
Colonel O
Forster O
gives O
us O
reason O
to O
expect O
him O
here O
soon O
. O
Lydia O
left O
a O
few O
lines O
for O
his O
wife O
, O
informing O
her O
of O
their O
intention O
. O
I O
must O
conclude O
, O
for O
I O
can O
not O
be O
long O
from O
my O
poor O
mother O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
make O
it O
out O
, O
but O
I O
hardly O
know O
what O
I O
have O
written O
. O
" O
Without O
allowing O
herself O
time O
for O
consideration O
, O
and O
scarcely O
knowing O
what O
she O
felt O
, O
Elizabeth O
on O
finishing O
this O
letter O
, O
instantly O
seized O
the O
other O
, O
and O
opening O
it O
with O
the O
utmost O
impatience O
, O
read O
as O
follows O
: O
it O
had O
been O
written O
a O
day O
later O
than O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
first O
. O
" O
By O
this O
time O
, O
my O
dearest O
sister O
, O
you O
have O
received O
my O
hurried O
letter O
; O
I O
wish O
this O
may O
be O
more O
intelligible O
, O
but O
though O
not O
confined O
for O
time O
, O
my O
head O
is O
so O
bewildered O
that O
I O
can O
not O
answer O
for O
being O
coherent O
. O
Dearest O
Lizzy O
, O
I O
hardly O
know O
what O
I O
would O
write O
, O
but O
I O
have O
bad O
news O
for O
you O
, O
and O
it O
can O
not O
be O
delayed O
. O
Imprudent O
as O
a O
marriage O
between O
Mr. O
Wickham O
and O
our O
poor O
Lydia O
would O
be O
, O
we O
are O
now O
anxious O
to O
be O
assured O
it O
has O
taken O
place O
, O
for O
there O
is O
but O
too O
much O
reason O
to O
fear O
they O
are O
not O
gone O
to O
Scotland O
. O
Colonel O
Forster O
came O
yesterday O
, O
having O
left O
Brighton O
the O
day O
before O
, O
not O
many O
hours O
after O
the O
express O
. O
Though O
Lydia O
's O
short O
letter O
to O
Mrs. O
F. O
gave O
them O
to O
understand O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
Gretna O
Green O
, O
something O
was O
dropped O
by O
Denny O
expressing O
his O
belief O
that O
W. O
never O
intended O
to O
go O
there O
, O
or O
to O
marry O
Lydia O
at O
all O
, O
which O
was O
repeated O
to O
Colonel O
F. O
who O
instantly O
taking O
the O
alarm O
, O
set O
off O
from O
B. O
intending O
to O
trace O
their O
route O
. O
He O
did O
trace O
them O
easily O
to O
Clapham O
, O
but O
no O
farther O
; O
for O
on O
entering O
that O
place O
they O
removed O
into O
a O
hackney-coach O
and O
dismissed O
the O
chaise O
that O
brought O
them O
from O
Epsom O
. O
All O
that O
is O
known O
after O
this O
is O
, O
that O
they O
were O
seen O
to O
continue O
the O
London O
road O
. O
I O
know O
not O
what O
to O
think O
. O
After O
making O
every O
possible O
enquiry O
on O
that O
side O
London O
, O
Colonel O
F. O
came O
on O
into O
Hertfordshire O
, O
anxiously O
renewing O
them O
at O
all O
the O
turnpikes O
, O
and O
at O
the O
inns O
in O
Barnet O
and O
Hatfield O
, O
but O
without O
any O
success O
, O
no O
such O
people O
had O
been O
seen O
to O
pass O
through O
. O
With O
the O
kindest O
concern O
he O
came O
on O
to O
Longbourn O
, O
and O
broke O
his O
apprehensions O
to O
us O
in O
a O
manner O
most O
creditable O
to O
his O
heart O
. O
I O
am O
sincerely O
grieved O
for O
him O
and O
Mrs. O
F. O
but O
no O
one O
can O
throw O
any O
blame O
on O
them O
. O
Our O
distress O
, O
my O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
is O
very O
great O
. O
My O
father O
and O
mother O
believe O
the O
worst O
, O
but O
I O
can O
not O
think O
so O
ill O
of O
him O
. O
Many O
circumstances O
might O
make O
it O
more O
eligible O
for O
them O
to O
be O
married O
privately O
in O
town O
than O
to O
pursue O
their O
first O
plan O
; O
and O
even O
if O
he O
could O
form O
such O
a O
design O
against O
a O
young O
woman O
of O
Lydia O
's O
connections O
, O
which O
is O
not O
likely O
, O
can O
I O
suppose O
her O
so O
lost O
to O
every O
thing O
? O
—Impossible O
. O
I O
grieve O
to O
find O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Colonel O
F. O
is O
not O
disposed O
to O
depend O
upon O
their O
marriage O
; O
he O
shook O
his O
head O
when O
I O
expressed O
my O
hopes O
, O
and O
said O
he O
feared O
W. O
was O
not O
a O
man O
to O
be O
trusted O
. O
My O
poor O
mother O
is O
really O
ill O
and O
keeps O
her O
room O
. O
Could O
she O
exert O
herself O
it O
would O
be O
better O
, O
but O
this O
is O
not O
to O
be O
expected O
; O
and O
as O
to O
my O
father O
, O
I O
never O
in O
my O
life O
saw O
him O
so O
affected O
. O
Poor O
Kitty O
has O
anger O
for O
having O
concealed O
their O
attachment O
; O
but O
as O
it O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
confidence O
one O
can O
not O
wonder O
. O
I O
am O
truly O
glad O
, O
dearest O
Lizzy O
, O
that O
you O
have O
been O
spared O
something O
of O
these O
distressing O
scenes O
; O
but O
now O
as O
the O
first O
shock O
is O
over O
, O
shall O
I O
own O
that O
I O
long O
for O
your O
return O
? O
I O
am O
not O
so O
selfish O
, O
however O
, O
as O
to O
press O
for O
it O
, O
if O
inconvenient O
. O
Adieu O
. O
I O
take O
up O
my O
pen O
again O
to O
do O
, O
what O
I O
have O
just O
told O
you O
I O
would O
not O
, O
but O
circumstances O
are O
such O
, O
that O
I O
can O
not O
help O
earnestly O
begging O
you O
all O
to O
come O
here O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
I O
know O
my O
dear O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
so O
well O
, O
that O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
of O
requesting O
it O
, O
though O
I O
have O
still O
something O
more O
to O
ask O
of O
the O
former O
. O
My O
father O
is O
going O
to O
London O
with O
Colonel O
Forster O
instantly O
, O
to O
try O
to O
discover O
her O
. O
What O
he O
means O
to O
do O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
know O
not O
; O
but O
his O
excessive O
distress O
will O
not O
allow O
him O
to O
pursue O
any O
measure O
in O
the O
best O
and O
safest O
way O
, O
and O
Colonel O
Forster O
is O
obliged O
to O
be O
at O
Brighton O
again O
to-morrow O
evening O
. O
In O
such O
an O
exigence O
my O
uncle O
's O
advice O
and O
assistance O
would O
be O
every O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
; O
he O
will O
immediately O
comprehend O
what O
I O
must O
feel O
, O
and O
I O
rely O
upon O
his O
goodness O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
where O
, O
where O
is O
my O
uncle O
? O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
darting O
from O
her O
seat O
as O
she O
finished O
the O
letter O
, O
in O
eagerness O
to O
follow O
him O
, O
without O
losing O
a O
moment O
of O
the O
time O
so O
precious O
; O
but O
as O
she O
reached O
the O
door O
, O
it O
was O
opened O
by O
a O
servant O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
appeared O
. O
Her O
pale O
face O
and O
impetuous O
manner O
made O
him O
start O
, O
and O
before O
he O
could O
recover O
himself O
enough O
to O
speak O
, O
she O
, O
in O
whose O
mind O
every O
idea O
was O
superseded O
by O
Lydia O
's O
situation O
, O
hastily O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
but O
I O
must O
leave O
you O
. O
I O
must O
find O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
this O
moment O
, O
on O
business O
that O
can O
not O
be O
delayed O
; O
I O
have O
not O
an O
instant O
to O
lose O
. O
" O
" O
Good O
God O
! O
what O
is O
the O
matter O
? O
" O
cried O
he O
, O
with O
more O
feeling O
than O
politeness O
; O
then O
recollecting O
himself O
, O
" O
I O
will O
not O
detain O
you O
a O
minute O
, O
but O
let O
me O
, O
or O
let O
the O
servant O
, O
go O
after O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
. O
You O
are O
not O
well O
enough O
; O
—you O
can O
not O
go O
yourself O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
hesitated O
, O
but O
her O
knees O
trembled O
under O
her O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
how O
little O
would O
be O
gained O
by O
her O
attempting O
to O
pursue O
them O
. O
Calling O
back O
the O
servant O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
commissioned O
him O
, O
though O
in O
so O
breathless O
an O
accent O
as O
made O
her O
almost O
unintelligible O
, O
to O
fetch O
his O
master O
and O
mistress O
home O
, O
instantly O
. O
On O
his O
quitting O
the O
room O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
, O
unable O
to O
support O
herself O
, O
and O
looking O
so O
miserably O
ill O
, O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
for O
Darcy O
to O
leave O
her O
, O
or O
to O
refrain O
from O
saying O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
gentleness O
and O
commiseration O
, O
" O
Let O
me O
call O
your O
maid O
. O
Is O
there O
nothing O
you O
could O
take O
, O
to O
give O
you O
present O
relief O
? O
—A O
glass O
of O
wine O
; O
—shall O
I O
get O
you O
one O
? O
—You O
are O
very O
ill O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
I O
thank O
you O
; O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
endeavouring O
to O
recover O
herself O
. O
" O
There O
is O
nothing O
the O
matter O
with O
me O
. O
I O
am O
quite O
well O
. O
I O
am O
only O
distressed O
by O
some O
dreadful O
news O
which O
I O
have O
just O
received O
from O
Longbourn O
. O
" O
She O
burst O
into O
tears O
as O
she O
alluded O
to O
it O
, O
and O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
could O
not O
speak O
another O
word O
. O
Darcy O
, O
in O
wretched O
suspense O
, O
could O
only O
say O
something O
indistinctly O
of O
his O
concern O
, O
and O
observe O
her O
in O
compassionate O
silence O
. O
At O
length O
, O
she O
spoke O
again O
. O
" O
I O
have O
just O
had O
a O
letter O
from O
Jane O
, O
with O
such O
dreadful O
news O
. O
It O
can O
not O
be O
concealed O
from O
any O
one O
. O
My O
youngest O
sister O
has O
left O
all O
her O
friends—has O
eloped O
; O
—has O
thrown O
herself O
into O
the O
power O
of—of O
Mr. O
Wickham O
. O
They O
are O
gone O
off O
together O
from O
Brighton O
. O
You O
know O
him O
too O
well O
to O
doubt O
the O
rest O
. O
She O
has O
no O
money O
, O
no O
connections O
, O
nothing O
that O
can O
tempt O
him O
to—she O
is O
lost O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
Darcy O
was O
fixed O
in O
astonishment O
. O
" O
When O
I O
consider O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
in O
a O
yet O
more O
agitated O
voice O
, O
" O
that O
I O
might O
have O
prevented O
it O
! O
—I O
who O
knew O
what O
he O
was O
. O
Had O
I O
but O
explained O
some O
part O
of O
it O
only—some O
part O
of O
what O
I O
learnt O
, O
to O
my O
own O
family O
! O
Had O
his O
character O
been O
known O
, O
this O
could O
not O
have O
happened O
. O
But O
it O
is O
all O
, O
all O
too O
late O
now O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
grieved O
, O
indeed O
, O
" O
cried O
Darcy O
; O
" O
grieved—shocked O
. O
But O
is O
it O
certain O
, O
absolutely O
certain O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
yes O
! O
—They O
left O
Brighton O
together O
on O
Sunday O
night O
, O
and O
were O
traced O
almost O
to O
London O
, O
but O
not O
beyond O
; O
they O
are O
certainly O
not O
gone O
to O
Scotland O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
has O
been O
done O
, O
what O
has O
been O
attempted O
, O
to O
recover O
her O
? O
" O
My O
father O
is O
gone O
to O
London O
, O
and O
Jane O
has O
written O
to O
beg O
my O
uncle O
's O
immediate O
assistance O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
be O
off O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
. O
But O
nothing O
can O
be O
done O
; O
I O
know O
very O
well O
that O
nothing O
can O
be O
done O
. O
How O
is O
such O
a O
man O
to O
be O
worked O
on O
? O
How O
are O
they O
even O
to O
be O
discovered O
? O
I O
have O
not O
the O
smallest O
hope O
. O
It O
is O
every O
way O
horrible O
! O
" O
Darcy O
shook O
his O
head O
in O
silent O
acquiescence O
. O
" O
When O
my O
eyes O
were O
opened O
to O
his O
real O
character.—Oh O
! O
had O
I O
known O
what O
I O
ought O
, O
what O
I O
dared O
, O
to O
do O
! O
But O
I O
knew O
not—I O
was O
afraid O
of O
doing O
too O
much O
. O
Wretched O
, O
wretched O
, O
mistake O
! O
" O
Darcy O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
He O
seemed O
scarcely O
to O
hear O
her O
, O
and O
was O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
in O
earnest O
meditation O
; O
his O
brow O
contracted O
, O
his O
air O
gloomy O
. O
Elizabeth O
soon O
observed O
, O
and O
instantly O
understood O
it O
. O
Her O
power O
was O
sinking O
; O
every O
thing O
must O
sink O
under O
such O
a O
proof O
of O
family O
weakness O
, O
such O
an O
assurance O
of O
the O
deepest O
disgrace O
. O
She O
could O
neither O
wonder O
nor O
condemn O
, O
but O
the O
belief O
of O
his O
self-conquest O
brought O
nothing O
consolatory O
to O
her O
bosom O
, O
afforded O
no O
palliation O
of O
her O
distress O
. O
It O
was O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
exactly O
calculated O
to O
make O
her O
understand O
her O
own O
wishes O
; O
and O
never O
had O
she O
so O
honestly O
felt O
that O
she O
could O
have O
loved O
him O
, O
as O
now O
, O
when O
all O
love O
must O
be O
vain O
. O
But O
self O
, O
though O
it O
would O
intrude O
, O
could O
not O
engross O
her O
. O
Lydia—the O
humiliation O
, O
the O
misery O
, O
she O
was O
bringing O
on O
them O
all O
, O
soon O
swallowed O
up O
every O
private O
care O
; O
and O
covering O
her O
face O
with O
her O
handkerchief O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
soon O
lost O
to O
every O
thing O
else O
; O
and O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
of O
several O
minutes O
, O
was O
only O
recalled O
to O
a O
sense O
of O
her O
situation O
by O
the O
voice O
of O
her O
companion O
, O
who O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
, O
which O
though O
it O
spoke O
compassion O
, O
spoke O
likewise O
restraint O
, O
said O
, O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
have O
been O
long O
desiring O
my O
absence O
, O
nor O
have O
I O
any O
thing O
to O
plead O
in O
excuse O
of O
my O
stay O
, O
but O
real O
, O
though O
un- O
availing O
, O
concern O
. O
Would O
to O
heaven O
that O
any O
thing O
could O
be O
either O
said O
or O
done O
on O
my O
part O
, O
that O
might O
offer O
consolation O
to O
such O
distress.—But O
I O
will O
not O
torment O
you O
with O
vain O
wishes O
, O
which O
may O
seem O
purposely O
to O
ask O
for O
your O
thanks O
. O
This O
unfortunate O
affair O
will O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
prevent O
my O
sister O
's O
having O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
you O
at O
Pemberley O
to O
day O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
. O
Be O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
apologize O
for O
us O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
. O
Say O
that O
urgent O
business O
calls O
us O
home O
immediately O
. O
Conceal O
the O
unhappy O
truth O
as O
long O
as O
it O
is O
possible.—I O
know O
it O
can O
not O
be O
long O
. O
" O
He O
readily O
assured O
her O
of O
his O
secrecy—again O
expressed O
his O
sorrow O
for O
her O
distress O
, O
wished O
it O
a O
happier O
conclusion O
than O
there O
was O
at O
present O
reason O
to O
hope O
, O
and O
leaving O
his O
compliments O
for O
her O
relations O
, O
with O
only O
one O
serious O
, O
parting O
, O
look O
, O
went O
away O
. O
As O
he O
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
Elizabeth O
felt O
how O
improbable O
it O
was O
that O
they O
should O
ever O
see O
each O
other O
again O
on O
such O
terms O
of O
cordiality O
as O
had O
marked O
their O
several O
meetings O
in O
Derbyshire O
; O
and O
as O
she O
threw O
a O
retrospective O
glance O
over O
the O
whole O
of O
their O
acquaintance O
, O
so O
full O
of O
contradictions O
and O
varieties O
, O
sighed O
at O
the O
perverseness O
of O
those O
feelings O
which O
would O
now O
have O
promoted O
its O
continuance O
, O
and O
would O
formerly O
have O
rejoiced O
in O
its O
termination O
. O
If O
gratitude O
and O
esteem O
are O
good O
foundations O
of O
affection O
, O
Elizabeth O
's O
change O
of O
sentiment O
will O
be O
neither O
improbable O
nor O
faulty O
. O
But O
if O
otherwise O
, O
if O
the O
regard O
springing O
from O
such O
sources O
is O
unreasonable O
or O
unnatural O
, O
in O
comparison O
of O
what O
is O
so O
often O
described O
as O
arising O
on O
a O
first O
interview O
with O
its O
object O
, O
and O
even O
before O
two O
words O
have O
been O
exchanged O
, O
nothing O
can O
be O
said O
in O
her O
defence O
, O
except O
that O
she O
had O
given O
somewhat O
of O
a O
trial O
to O
the O
latter O
method O
, O
in O
her O
partiality O
for O
Wickham O
, O
and O
that O
its O
ill-success O
might O
perhaps O
authorise O
her O
to O
seek O
the O
other O
less O
interesting O
mode O
of O
attachment O
. O
Be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
she O
saw O
him O
go O
with O
regret O
; O
and O
in O
this O
early O
example O
of O
what O
Lydia O
's O
infamy O
must O
produce O
, O
found O
additional O
anguish O
as O
she O
reflected O
on O
that O
wretched O
business O
. O
Never O
, O
since O
reading O
Jane O
's O
second O
letter O
, O
had O
she O
entertained O
a O
hope O
of O
Wickham O
's O
meaning O
to O
marry O
her O
. O
No O
one O
but O
Jane O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
could O
flatter O
herself O
with O
such O
an O
expectation O
. O
Surprise O
was O
the O
least O
of O
her O
feelings O
on O
this O
developement O
. O
While O
the O
contents O
of O
the O
first O
letter O
remained O
on O
her O
mind O
, O
she O
was O
all O
surprise—all O
astonishment O
that O
Wickham O
should O
marry O
a O
girl O
, O
whom O
it O
was O
impossible O
he O
could O
marry O
for O
money O
; O
and O
how O
Lydia O
could O
ever O
have O
attached O
him O
, O
had O
appeared O
incomprehensible O
. O
But O
now O
it O
was O
all O
too O
natural O
. O
For O
such O
an O
attachment O
as O
this O
, O
she O
might O
have O
sufficient O
charms O
; O
and O
though O
she O
did O
not O
suppose O
Lydia O
to O
be O
deliberately O
engaging O
in O
an O
elopement O
, O
without O
the O
intention O
of O
marriage O
, O
she O
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
believing O
that O
neither O
her O
virtue O
nor O
her O
understanding O
would O
preserve O
her O
from O
falling O
an O
easy O
prey O
. O
She O
had O
never O
perceived O
, O
while O
the O
regiment O
was O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
that O
Lydia O
had O
any O
partiality O
for O
him O
, O
but O
she O
was O
convinced O
that O
Lydia O
had O
wanted O
only O
encouragement O
to O
attach O
herself O
to O
any O
body O
. O
Sometimes O
one O
officer O
, O
sometimes O
another O
had O
been O
her O
favourite O
, O
as O
their O
attentions O
raised O
them O
in O
her O
opinion O
. O
Her O
affections O
had O
been O
continually O
fluctuating O
, O
but O
never O
without O
an O
object O
. O
The O
mischief O
of O
neglect O
and O
mistaken O
indulgence O
towards O
such O
a O
girl.—Oh O
! O
how O
acutely O
did O
she O
now O
feel O
it O
. O
She O
was O
wild O
to O
be O
at O
home—to O
hear O
, O
to O
see O
, O
to O
be O
upon O
the O
spot O
, O
to O
share O
with O
Jane O
in O
the O
cares O
that O
must O
now O
fall O
wholly O
upon O
her O
, O
in O
a O
family O
so O
deranged O
; O
a O
father O
absent O
, O
a O
mother O
incapable O
of O
exertion O
, O
and O
requiring O
constant O
attendance O
; O
and O
though O
almost O
persuaded O
that O
nothing O
could O
be O
done O
for O
Lydia O
, O
her O
uncle O
's O
interference O
seemed O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
, O
and O
till O
he O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
the O
misery O
of O
her O
impatience O
was O
severe O
. O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
had O
hurried O
back O
in O
alarm O
, O
supposing O
, O
by O
the O
servant O
's O
account O
, O
that O
their O
niece O
was O
taken O
suddenly O
ill O
; O
—but O
satisfying O
them O
instantly O
on O
that O
head O
, O
she O
eagerly O
communicated O
the O
cause O
of O
their O
summons O
, O
reading O
the O
two O
letters O
aloud O
, O
and O
dwelling O
on O
the O
postscript O
of O
the O
last O
, O
with O
trembling O
energy.—Though O
Lydia O
had O
never O
been O
a O
favourite O
with O
them O
, O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
could O
not O
but O
be O
deeply O
affected O
. O
Not O
Lydia O
only O
, O
but O
all O
were O
concerned O
in O
it O
; O
and O
after O
the O
first O
exclamations O
of O
surprise O
and O
horror O
, O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
readily O
promised O
every O
assistance O
in O
his O
power.—Elizabeth O
, O
though O
expecting O
no O
less O
, O
thanked O
him O
with O
tears O
of O
gratitude O
; O
and O
all O
three O
being O
actuated O
by O
one O
spirit O
, O
every O
thing O
relating O
to O
their O
journey O
was O
speedily O
settled O
. O
They O
were O
to O
be O
off O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
" O
But O
what O
is O
to O
be O
done O
about O
Pemberley O
? O
" O
cried O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
. O
" O
John O
told O
us O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
here O
when O
you O
sent O
for O
us O
; O
—was O
it O
so O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
and O
I O
told O
him O
we O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
our O
engagement O
. O
That O
is O
all O
settled O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
all O
settled O
; O
" O
repeated O
the O
other O
, O
as O
she O
ran O
into O
her O
room O
to O
prepare O
. O
And O
are O
they O
upon O
such O
terms O
as O
for O
her O
to O
disclose O
the O
real O
truth O
! O
Oh O
, O
that O
I O
knew O
how O
it O
was O
! O
" O
But O
wishes O
were O
vain O
; O
or O
at O
best O
could O
serve O
only O
to O
amuse O
her O
in O
the O
hurry O
and O
confusion O
of O
the O
following O
hour O
. O
Had O
Elizabeth O
been O
at O
leisure O
to O
be O
idle O
, O
she O
would O
have O
remained O
certain O
that O
all O
employment O
was O
impossi- O
ble O
to O
one O
so O
wretched O
as O
herself O
; O
but O
she O
had O
her O
share O
of O
business O
as O
well O
as O
her O
aunt O
, O
and O
amongst O
the O
rest O
there O
were O
notes O
to O
be O
written O
to O
all O
their O
friends O
in O
Lambton O
, O
with O
false O
excuses O
for O
their O
sudden O
departure O
. O
An O
hour O
, O
however O
, O
saw O
the O
whole O
completed O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
meanwhile O
having O
settled O
his O
account O
at O
the O
inn O
, O
nothing O
remained O
to O
be O
done O
but O
to O
go O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
after O
all O
the O
misery O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
found O
herself O
, O
in O
a O
shorter O
space O
of O
time O
than O
she O
could O
have O
supposed O
, O
seated O
in O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
on O
the O
road O
to O
Longbourn O
. O
