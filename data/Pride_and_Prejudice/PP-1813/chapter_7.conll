Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
property O
consisted O
almost O
entirely O
in O
an O
estate O
of O
two O
thousand O
a O
year O
, O
which O
, O
unfortunately O
for O
his O
daughters O
, O
was O
entailed O
in O
default O
of O
heirs O
male O
, O
on O
a O
distant O
relation O
; O
and O
their O
mother O
's O
fortune O
, O
though O
ample O
for O
her O
situation O
in O
life O
, O
could O
but O
ill O
supply O
the O
deficiency O
of O
his O
. O
Her O
father O
had O
been O
an O
attorney O
in O
Meryton O
, O
and O
had O
left O
her O
four O
thousand O
pounds O
. O
She O
had O
a O
sister O
married O
to O
a O
Mr. O
Phillips O
, O
who O
had O
been O
a O
clerk O
to O
their O
father O
, O
and O
succeeded O
him O
in O
the O
business O
, O
and O
a O
brother O
settled O
in O
London O
in O
a O
respectable O
line O
of O
trade O
. O
The O
village O
of O
Longbourn O
was O
only O
one O
mile O
from O
Meryton O
; O
a O
most O
convenient O
distance O
for O
the O
young O
ladies O
, O
who O
were O
usually O
tempted O
thither O
three O
or O
four O
times O
a O
week O
, O
to O
pay O
their O
duty O
to O
their O
aunt O
and O
to O
a O
milliner O
's O
shop O
just O
over O
the O
way O
. O
The O
two O
youngest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
Catherine O
and O
Lydia O
, O
were O
particularly O
frequent O
in O
these O
attentions O
; O
their O
minds O
were O
more O
vacant O
than O
their O
sisters O
' O
, O
and O
when O
nothing O
better O
offered O
, O
a O
walk O
to O
Meryton O
was O
necessary O
to O
amuse O
their O
morning O
hours O
and O
furnish O
conversation O
for O
the O
evening O
; O
and O
however O
bare O
of O
news O
the O
country O
in O
general O
might O
be O
, O
they O
always O
contrived O
to O
learn O
some O
from O
their O
aunt O
. O
At O
present O
, O
indeed O
, O
they O
were O
well O
supplied O
both O
with O
news O
and O
happiness O
by O
the O
recent O
arrival O
of O
a O
militia O
regiment O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
; O
it O
was O
to O
remain O
the O
whole O
winter O
, O
and O
Meryton O
was O
the O
head O
quarters O
. O
Their O
visits O
to O
Mrs. O
Philips O
were O
now O
productive O
of O
the O
most O
interesting O
intelligence O
. O
Every O
day O
added O
something O
to O
their O
knowledge O
of O
the O
officers O
' O
names O
and O
connections O
. O
Their O
lodgings O
were O
not O
long O
a O
secret O
, O
and O
at O
length O
they O
began O
to O
know O
the O
officers O
themselves O
. O
Mr. O
Philips O
visited O
them O
all O
, O
and O
this O
opened O
to O
his O
nieces O
a O
source O
of O
felicity O
unknown O
before O
. O
They O
could O
talk O
of O
nothing O
but O
officers O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
large O
fortune O
, O
the O
mention O
of O
which O
gave O
animation O
to O
their O
mother O
, O
was O
worthless O
in O
their O
eyes O
when O
opposed O
to O
the O
regimentals O
of O
an O
ensign O
. O
After O
listening O
one O
morning O
to O
their O
effusions O
on O
this O
subject O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
coolly O
observed O
, O
" O
From O
all O
that O
I O
can O
collect O
by O
your O
manner O
of O
talking O
, O
you O
must O
be O
two O
of O
the O
silliest O
girls O
in O
the O
country O
. O
I O
have O
suspected O
it O
some O
time O
, O
but O
I O
am O
now O
convinced O
. O
" O
Catherine O
was O
disconcerted O
, O
and O
made O
no O
answer O
; O
but O
Lydia O
, O
with O
perfect O
indifference O
, O
continued O
to O
express O
her O
admiration O
of O
Captain O
Carter O
, O
and O
her O
hope O
of O
seeing O
him O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
, O
as O
he O
was O
going O
the O
next O
morning O
to O
London O
. O
" O
I O
am O
astonished O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
that O
you O
should O
be O
so O
ready O
to O
think O
your O
own O
children O
silly O
. O
If O
I O
wished O
to O
think O
slightingly O
of O
any O
body O
's O
children O
, O
it O
should O
not O
be O
of O
my O
own O
however O
. O
" O
" O
If O
my O
children O
are O
silly O
I O
must O
hope O
to O
be O
always O
sensible O
of O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Yes—but O
as O
it O
happens O
, O
they O
are O
all O
of O
them O
very O
clever O
. O
" O
" O
This O
is O
the O
only O
point O
, O
I O
flatter O
myself O
, O
on O
which O
we O
do O
not O
agree O
. O
I O
had O
hoped O
that O
our O
sentiments O
coincided O
in O
every O
particular O
, O
but O
I O
must O
so O
far O
differ O
from O
you O
as O
to O
think O
our O
two O
youngest O
daughters O
uncommonly O
foolish O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
you O
must O
not O
expect O
such O
girls O
to O
have O
the O
sense O
of O
their O
father O
and O
mother.—When O
they O
get O
to O
our O
age O
I O
dare O
say O
they O
will O
not O
think O
about O
officers O
any O
more O
than O
we O
do O
. O
I O
remember O
the O
time O
when O
I O
liked O
a O
red-coat O
myself O
very O
well—and O
indeed O
so O
I O
do O
still O
at O
my O
heart O
; O
and O
if O
a O
smart O
young O
colonel O
, O
with O
five O
or O
six O
thousand O
a O
year O
, O
should O
want O
one O
of O
my O
girls O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
say O
nay O
to O
him O
; O
and O
I O
thought O
Colonel O
Forster O
looked O
very O
becoming O
the O
other O
night O
at O
Sir O
William O
's O
in O
his O
regimentals O
. O
" O
" O
Mama O
, O
" O
cried O
Lydia O
, O
" O
my O
aunt O
says O
that O
Colonel O
Forster O
and O
Captain O
Carter O
do O
not O
go O
so O
often O
to O
Miss O
Watson O
's O
as O
they O
did O
when O
they O
first O
came O
; O
she O
sees O
them O
now O
very O
often O
standing O
in O
Clarke O
's O
library O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
prevented O
replying O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
footman O
with O
a O
note O
for O
Miss O
Bennet O
; O
it O
came O
from O
Netherfield O
, O
and O
the O
servant O
waited O
for O
an O
answer O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
eyes O
sparkled O
with O
pleasure O
, O
and O
she O
was O
eagerly O
calling O
out O
, O
while O
her O
daughter O
read O
, O
" O
Well O
, O
Jane O
, O
who O
is O
it O
from O
? O
what O
is O
it O
about O
? O
what O
does O
he O
say O
? O
well O
, O
Jane O
, O
make O
haste O
and O
tell O
us O
; O
make O
haste O
, O
my O
love O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
from O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
, O
and O
then O
read O
it O
aloud O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Friend O
, O
" O
If O
you O
are O
not O
so O
compassionate O
as O
to O
dine O
to-day O
with O
Louisa O
and O
me O
, O
we O
shall O
be O
in O
danger O
of O
hating O
each O
other O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
our O
lives O
, O
for O
a O
whole O
day O
's O
tête-à-tête O
between O
two O
women O
can O
never O
end O
without O
a O
quarrel O
. O
Come O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
on O
the O
receipt O
of O
this O
. O
My O
brother O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
are O
to O
dine O
with O
the O
officers O
. O
Yours O
ever O
, O
" O
Caroline O
Bingley O
. O
" O
" O
With O
the O
officers O
! O
" O
cried O
Lydia O
. O
" O
I O
wonder O
my O
aunt O
did O
not O
tell O
us O
of O
that O
. O
" O
" O
Dining O
out O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
that O
is O
very O
unlucky O
. O
" O
" O
Can O
I O
have O
the O
carriage O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
. O
" O
No O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
had O
better O
go O
on O
horseback O
, O
because O
it O
seems O
likely O
to O
rain O
; O
and O
then O
you O
must O
stay O
all O
night O
. O
" O
" O
That O
would O
be O
a O
good O
scheme O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
if O
you O
were O
sure O
that O
they O
would O
not O
offer O
to O
send O
her O
home O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
but O
the O
gentlemen O
will O
have O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
chaise O
to O
go O
to O
Meryton O
; O
and O
the O
Hursts O
have O
no O
horses O
to O
theirs O
. O
" O
" O
I O
had O
much O
rather O
go O
in O
the O
coach O
. O
" O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
your O
father O
can O
not O
spare O
the O
horses O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
. O
They O
are O
wanted O
in O
the O
farm O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
are O
not O
they O
? O
" O
" O
They O
are O
wanted O
in O
the O
farm O
much O
oftener O
than O
I O
can O
get O
them O
. O
" O
" O
But O
if O
you O
have O
got O
them O
to O
day O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
my O
mother O
's O
purdose O
will O
be O
answered O
. O
" O
She O
did O
at O
last O
extort O
from O
her O
father O
an O
acknowledgment O
that O
the O
horses O
were O
engaged O
, O
Jane O
was O
therefore O
obliged O
to O
go O
on O
horseback O
, O
and O
her O
mother O
attended O
her O
to O
the O
door O
with O
many O
cheerful O
prognostics O
of O
a O
bad O
day O
. O
Her O
hopes O
were O
answered O
; O
Jane O
had O
not O
been O
gone O
long O
before O
it O
rained O
hard O
. O
Her O
sisters O
were O
uneasy O
for O
her O
, O
but O
her O
mother O
was O
delighted O
. O
The O
rain O
continued O
the O
whole O
evening O
without O
intermission O
; O
Jane O
certainly O
could O
not O
come O
back O
. O
" O
This O
was O
a O
lucky O
idea O
of O
mine O
, O
indeed O
! O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
more O
than O
once O
, O
as O
if O
the O
credit O
of O
making O
it O
rain O
were O
all O
her O
own O
. O
Till O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
however O
, O
she O
was O
not O
aware O
of O
all O
the O
felicity O
of O
her O
contrivance O
. O
Breakfast O
was O
scarcely O
over O
when O
a O
servant O
from O
Netherfield O
brought O
the O
following O
note O
for O
Elizabeth O
: O
" O
My O
dearest O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
I O
find O
myself O
very O
unwell O
this O
morning O
, O
which O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
is O
to O
be O
imputed O
to O
my O
getting O
wet O
through O
yesterday O
. O
My O
kind O
friends O
will O
not O
hear O
of O
my O
returning O
home O
till O
I O
am O
better O
. O
They O
insist O
also O
on O
my O
seeing O
Mr. O
Jones—therefore O
do O
not O
be O
alarmed O
if O
you O
should O
hear O
of O
his O
having O
been O
to O
me—and O
excepting O
a O
sore-throat O
and O
head-ache O
there O
is O
not O
much O
the O
matter O
with O
me O
. O
" O
Yours O
, O
& O
c O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
when O
Elizabeth O
had O
read O
the O
note O
aloud O
, O
" O
if O
your O
daughter O
should O
have O
a O
dangerous O
fit O
of O
illness O
, O
if O
she O
should O
die O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
comfort O
to O
know O
that O
it O
was O
all O
in O
pursuit O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
and O
under O
your O
orders O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
I O
am O
not O
at O
all O
afraid O
of O
her O
dying O
. O
People O
do O
not O
die O
of O
little O
trifling O
colds O
. O
She O
will O
be O
taken O
good O
care O
of O
. O
As O
long O
as O
she O
stays O
there O
, O
it O
is O
all O
very O
well O
. O
I O
would O
go O
and O
see O
her O
, O
if O
I O
could O
have O
the O
carriage O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
, O
feeling O
really O
anxious O
, O
was O
determined O
to O
go O
to O
her O
, O
though O
the O
carriage O
was O
not O
to O
be O
had O
; O
and O
as O
she O
was O
no O
horse-woman O
, O
walking O
was O
her O
only O
alternative O
. O
She O
declared O
her O
resolution O
. O
" O
How O
can O
you O
be O
so O
silly O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
as O
to O
think O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
in O
all O
this O
dirt O
! O
You O
will O
not O
be O
fit O
to O
be O
seen O
when O
you O
get O
there O
. O
" O
" O
I O
shall O
be O
very O
fit O
to O
see O
Jane—which O
is O
all O
I O
want O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
this O
a O
hint O
to O
me O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
her O
father O
, O
" O
to O
send O
for O
the O
horses O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
indeed O
. O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
avoid O
the O
walk O
. O
The O
distance O
is O
nothing O
, O
when O
one O
has O
a O
motive O
; O
only O
three O
miles O
. O
I O
shall O
be O
back O
by O
dinner O
. O
" O
" O
I O
admire O
the O
activity O
of O
your O
benevolence O
, O
" O
observed O
Mary O
, O
" O
but O
every O
impulse O
of O
feeling O
should O
be O
guided O
by O
reason O
; O
and O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
exertion O
should O
always O
be O
in O
proportion O
to O
what O
is O
required O
. O
" O
" O
We O
will O
go O
as O
far O
as O
Meryton O
with O
you O
, O
" O
said O
Catherine O
and O
Lydia.—Elizabeth O
accepted O
their O
company O
, O
and O
the O
three O
young O
ladies O
set O
off O
together O
. O
" O
If O
we O
make O
haste O
, O
" O
said O
Lydia O
, O
as O
they O
walked O
along O
, O
" O
perhaps O
we O
may O
see O
something O
of O
Captain O
Carter O
before O
he O
goes O
. O
" O
In O
Meryton O
they O
parted O
; O
the O
two O
youngest O
repaired O
to O
the O
lodgings O
of O
one O
of O
the O
officers O
' O
wives O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
continued O
her O
walk O
alone O
, O
crossing O
field O
after O
field O
at O
a O
quick O
pace O
, O
jumping O
over O
stiles O
and O
springing O
over O
puddles O
with O
impatient O
activity O
, O
and O
finding O
herself O
at O
last O
within O
view O
of O
the O
house O
, O
with O
weary O
ancles O
, O
dirty O
stockings O
, O
and O
a O
face O
glowing O
with O
the O
warmth O
of O
exercise O
. O
She O
was O
shewn O
into O
the O
breakfast-parlour O
, O
where O
all O
but O
Jane O
were O
assembled O
, O
and O
where O
her O
appearance O
created O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
surprise.—That O
she O
should O
have O
walked O
three O
miles O
so O
early O
in O
the O
day O
, O
in O
such O
dirty O
weather O
, O
and O
by O
herself O
, O
was O
almost O
incredible O
to O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
convinced O
that O
they O
held O
her O
in O
contempt O
for O
it O
. O
She O
was O
received O
, O
however O
, O
very O
politely O
by O
them O
; O
and O
in O
their O
brother O
's O
manners O
there O
was O
something O
better O
than O
politeness O
; O
there O
was O
good O
humour O
and O
kindness.—Mr O
. O
Darcy O
said O
very O
little O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Hurst O
nothing O
at O
all O
. O
The O
former O
was O
divided O
between O
admiration O
of O
the O
brilliancy O
which O
exercise O
had O
given O
to O
her O
complexion O
, O
and O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
occasion O
's O
justifying O
her O
coming O
so O
far O
alone O
. O
The O
latter O
was O
thinking O
only O
of O
his O
breakfast O
. O
Her O
enquiries O
after O
her O
sister O
were O
not O
very O
favourably O
answered O
. O
Miss O
Bennet O
had O
slept O
ill O
, O
and O
though O
up O
, O
was O
very O
feverish O
and O
not O
well O
enough O
to O
leave O
her O
room O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
glad O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
her O
immediately O
; O
and O
Jane O
, O
who O
had O
only O
been O
withheld O
by O
the O
fear O
of O
giving O
alarm O
or O
inconvenience O
, O
from O
expressing O
in O
her O
note O
how O
much O
she O
longed O
for O
such O
a O
visit O
, O
was O
delighted O
at O
her O
entrance O
. O
She O
was O
not O
equal O
, O
however O
, O
to O
much O
conversation O
, O
and O
when O
Miss O
Bingley O
left O
them O
together O
, O
could O
attempt O
little O
beside O
expressions O
of O
gratitude O
for O
the O
extraordinary O
kindness O
she O
was O
treated O
with O
. O
Elizabeth O
silently O
attended O
her O
. O
When O
breakfast O
was O
over O
, O
they O
were O
joined O
by O
the O
sisters O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
began O
to O
like O
them O
herself O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
how O
much O
affection O
and O
solicitude O
they O
shewed O
for O
Jane O
. O
The O
apothecary O
came O
, O
and O
having O
examined O
his O
patient O
, O
said O
, O
as O
might O
be O
supposed O
, O
that O
she O
had O
caught O
a O
violent O
cold O
, O
and O
that O
they O
must O
endeavour O
to O
get O
the O
better O
of O
it O
; O
advised O
her O
to O
return O
to O
bed O
, O
and O
promised O
her O
some O
draughts O
. O
The O
advice O
was O
followed O
readily O
, O
for O
the O
feverish O
symptoms O
increased O
, O
and O
her O
head O
ached O
acutely O
. O
Elizabeth O
did O
not O
quit O
her O
room O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
nor O
were O
the O
other O
ladies O
often O
absent O
; O
the O
gentlemen O
being O
out O
, O
they O
had O
in O
fact O
nothing O
to O
do O
elsewhere O
. O
When O
the O
clock O
struck O
three O
, O
Elizabeth O
felt O
that O
she O
must O
go O
; O
and O
very O
unwillingly O
said O
so O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
offered O
her O
the O
carriage O
, O
and O
she O
only O
wanted O
a O
little O
pressing O
to O
accept O
it O
, O
when O
Jane O
testified O
such O
concern O
in O
parting O
with O
her O
, O
that O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
obliged O
to O
convert O
the O
offer O
of O
the O
chaise O
into O
an O
invitation O
to O
remain O
at O
Netherfield O
for O
the O
present O
. O
Elizabeth O
most O
thankfully O
consented O
, O
and O
a O
servant O
was O
dispatched O
to O
Longbourn O
to O
acquaint O
the O
family O
with O
her O
stay O
, O
and O
bring O
back O
a O
supply O
of O
clothes O
. O
