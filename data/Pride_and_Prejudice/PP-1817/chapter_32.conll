Elizabeth O
was O
sitting O
by O
herself O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
and O
writing O
to O
Jane O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Collins O
and O
Maria O
were O
gone O
on O
business O
into O
the O
village O
, O
when O
she O
was O
startled O
by O
a O
ring O
at O
the O
door O
, O
the O
certain O
signal O
of O
a O
visitor O
. O
As O
she O
had O
heard O
no O
carriage O
, O
she O
thought O
it O
not O
unlikely O
to O
be O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
and O
under O
that O
apprehension O
was O
putting O
away O
her O
half-finished O
letter O
that O
she O
might O
escape O
all O
impertinent O
questions O
, O
when O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
to O
her O
very O
great O
surprize O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
only O
, O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
He O
seemed O
astonished O
too O
on O
finding O
her O
alone O
, O
and O
apologised O
for O
his O
intrusion O
, O
by O
letting O
her O
know O
that O
he O
had O
understood O
all O
the O
ladies O
to O
be O
within O
. O
They O
then O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
when O
her O
inquiries O
after O
Rosings O
were O
made O
, O
seemed O
in O
danger O
of O
sinking O
into O
total O
silence O
. O
It O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
think O
of O
something O
, O
and O
in O
this O
emergence O
recollecting O
when O
she O
had O
seen O
him O
last O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
and O
feeling O
curious O
to O
know O
what O
he O
would O
say O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
their O
hasty O
departure O
, O
she O
observed O
, O
" O
How O
very O
suddenly O
you O
all O
quitted O
Netherfield O
last O
November O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
! O
It O
must O
have O
been O
a O
most O
agreeable O
surprize O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley O
to O
see O
you O
all O
after O
him O
so O
soon O
; O
for O
, O
if O
I O
recollect O
right O
, O
he O
went O
but O
the O
day O
before O
. O
He O
and O
his O
sisters O
were O
well O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
when O
you O
left O
London O
. O
" O
Perfectly O
so—I O
thank O
you O
. O
" O
She O
found O
that O
she O
was O
to O
receive O
no O
other O
answer—and O
, O
after O
a O
short O
pause O
, O
added O
, O
" O
I O
think O
I O
have O
understood O
that O
Mr. O
Bingley O
has O
not O
much O
idea O
of O
ever O
returning O
to O
Netherfield O
again O
? O
" O
" O
I O
have O
never O
heard O
him O
say O
so O
; O
but O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
he O
may O
spend O
very O
little O
of O
his O
time O
there O
in O
future O
. O
He O
has O
many O
friends O
, O
and O
he O
is O
at O
a O
time O
of O
life O
when O
friends O
and O
engagements O
are O
continually O
increasing O
. O
" O
" O
If O
he O
means O
to O
be O
but O
little O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
for O
the O
neighbourhood O
that O
he O
should O
give O
up O
the O
place O
entirely O
, O
for O
then O
we O
might O
possibly O
get O
a O
settled O
family O
there O
. O
But O
, O
perhaps O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
did O
not O
take O
the O
house O
so O
much O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
as O
for O
his O
own O
, O
and O
we O
must O
expect O
him O
to O
keep O
or O
quit O
it O
on O
the O
same O
principle O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
not O
be O
surprized O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
, O
" O
if O
he O
were O
to O
give O
it O
up O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
any O
eligible O
purchase O
offers O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
She O
was O
afraid O
of O
talking O
longer O
of O
his O
friend O
; O
and O
, O
having O
nothing O
else O
to O
say O
, O
was O
now O
determined O
to O
leave O
the O
trouble O
of O
finding O
a O
subject O
to O
him O
. O
He O
took O
the O
hint O
, O
and O
soon O
began O
with O
, O
" O
This O
seems O
a O
very O
comfortable O
house O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
did O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
it O
when O
Mr. O
Collins O
first O
came O
to O
Hunsford O
. O
" O
" O
I O
believe O
she O
did—and O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
could O
not O
have O
bestowed O
her O
kindness O
on O
a O
more O
grateful O
object O
. O
" O
" O
Mr. O
Collins O
appears O
very O
fortunate O
in O
his O
choice O
of O
a O
wife O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
indeed O
; O
his O
friends O
may O
well O
rejoice O
in O
his O
having O
met O
with O
one O
of O
the O
very O
few O
sensible O
women O
who O
would O
have O
accepted O
him O
, O
or O
have O
made O
him O
happy O
if O
they O
had O
. O
My O
friend O
has O
an O
excellent O
understanding—though O
I O
am O
not O
certain O
that O
I O
consider O
her O
marrying O
Mr. O
Collins O
as O
the O
wisest O
thing O
she O
ever O
did O
. O
She O
seems O
perfectly O
happy O
, O
however O
, O
and O
in O
a O
prudential O
light O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
a O
very O
good O
match O
for O
her O
. O
" O
" O
It O
must O
be O
very O
agreeable O
to O
her O
to O
be O
settled O
within O
so O
easy O
a O
distance O
of O
her O
own O
family O
and O
friends O
. O
" O
" O
An O
easy O
distance O
do O
you O
call O
it O
? O
It O
is O
nearly O
fifty O
miles O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
is O
fifty O
miles O
of O
good O
road O
? O
Little O
more O
than O
half O
a O
day O
's O
journey O
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
call O
it O
a O
very O
easy O
distance O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
never O
have O
considered O
the O
distance O
as O
one O
of O
the O
advantages O
of O
the O
match O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
I O
should O
never O
have O
said O
Mrs. O
Collins O
was O
settled O
near O
her O
family O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
a O
proof O
of O
your O
own O
attachment O
to O
Hertfordshire O
. O
Any O
thing O
beyond O
the O
very O
neighbourhood O
of O
Longbourn O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
would O
appear O
far O
. O
" O
As O
he O
spoke O
there O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
smile O
, O
which O
Elizabeth O
fancied O
she O
understood O
; O
he O
must O
be O
supposing O
her O
to O
be O
thinking O
of O
Jane O
and O
Netherfield O
, O
and O
she O
blushed O
as O
she O
answered O
, O
" O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
to O
say O
that O
a O
woman O
may O
not O
be O
settled O
too O
near O
her O
family O
. O
The O
far O
and O
the O
near O
must O
be O
relative O
, O
and O
depend O
on O
many O
varying O
circumstances O
. O
Where O
there O
is O
fortune O
to O
make O
the O
expense O
of O
travelling O
unimportant O
, O
distance O
becomes O
no O
evil O
. O
But O
that O
is O
not O
the O
case O
here O
. O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Collins O
have O
a O
comfortable O
income O
, O
but O
not O
such O
a O
one O
as O
will O
allow O
of O
frequent O
journeys—and O
I O
am O
persuaded O
my O
friend O
would O
not O
call O
herself O
near O
her O
family O
under O
less O
than O
half O
the O
present O
distance O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
drew O
his O
chair O
a O
little O
towards O
her O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
You O
can O
not O
have O
a O
right O
to O
such O
very O
strong O
local O
attachment O
. O
You O
can O
not O
have O
been O
always O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
looked O
surprized O
. O
The O
gentleman O
experienced O
some O
change O
of O
feeling O
; O
he O
drew O
back O
his O
chair O
, O
took O
a O
newspaper O
from O
the O
table O
, O
and O
glancing O
over O
it O
, O
said O
, O
in O
a O
colder O
voice O
, O
" O
Are O
you O
pleased O
with O
Kent O
? O
" O
A O
short O
dialogue O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
country O
ensued O
, O
on O
either O
side O
calm O
and O
concise—and O
soon O
put O
an O
end O
to O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
Charlotte O
and O
her O
sister O
, O
just O
returned O
from O
their O
walk O
. O
The O
tête-à-tête O
surprized O
them O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
related O
the O
mistake O
which O
had O
occasioned O
his O
intruding O
on O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
and O
after O
sitting O
a O
few O
minutes O
longer O
without O
saying O
much O
to O
any O
body O
, O
went O
away O
. O
" O
What O
can O
be O
the O
meaning O
of O
this O
! O
" O
said O
Charlotte O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
gone O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Eliza O
, O
he O
must O
be O
in O
love O
with O
you O
, O
or O
he O
would O
never O
have O
called O
on O
us O
in O
this O
familiar O
way O
. O
" O
But O
when O
Elizabeth O
told O
of O
his O
silence O
, O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
very O
likely O
, O
even O
to O
Charlotte O
's O
wishes O
, O
to O
be O
the O
case O
; O
and O
after O
various O
conjectures O
, O
they O
could O
at O
last O
only O
suppose O
his O
visit O
to O
proceed O
from O
the O
difficulty O
of O
finding O
any O
thing O
to O
do O
, O
which O
was O
the O
more O
probable O
from O
the O
time O
of O
year O
. O
All O
field O
sports O
were O
over O
. O
Within O
doors O
there O
was O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
books O
, O
and O
a O
billiard O
table O
, O
but O
gentlemen O
can O
not O
be O
always O
within O
doors O
; O
and O
in O
the O
nearness O
of O
the O
Parsonage O
, O
or O
the O
pleasantness O
of O
the O
walk O
to O
it O
, O
or O
of O
the O
people O
who O
lived O
in O
it O
, O
the O
two O
cousins O
found O
a O
temptation O
from O
this O
period O
of O
walking O
thither O
almost O
every O
day O
. O
They O
called O
at O
various O
times O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
sometimes O
separately O
, O
sometimes O
together O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
accompanied O
by O
their O
aunt O
. O
It O
was O
plain O
to O
them O
all O
that O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
came O
because O
he O
had O
pleasure O
in O
their O
society O
, O
a O
persuasion O
which O
of O
course O
recommended O
him O
still O
more O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
reminded O
by O
her O
own O
satisfaction O
in O
being O
with O
him O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
his O
evident O
admiration O
of O
her O
, O
of O
her O
former O
favourite O
George O
Wickham O
; O
and O
though O
, O
in O
comparing O
them O
, O
she O
saw O
there O
was O
less O
captivating O
softness O
in O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
's O
manners O
, O
she O
believed O
he O
might O
have O
the O
best O
informed O
mind O
. O
But O
why O
Mr. O
Darcy O
came O
so O
often O
to O
the O
Parsonage O
, O
it O
was O
more O
difficult O
to O
understand O
. O
It O
could O
not O
be O
for O
society O
, O
as O
he O
frequently O
sat O
there O
ten O
minutes O
together O
without O
opening O
his O
lips O
; O
and O
when O
he O
did O
speak O
, O
it O
seemed O
the O
effect O
of O
necessity O
rather O
than O
of O
choice—a O
sacrifice O
to O
propriety O
, O
not O
a O
pleasure O
to O
himself O
. O
He O
seldom O
appeared O
really O
animated O
. O
Mrs. O
Collins O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
make O
of O
him O
. O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
's O
occasionally O
laughing O
at O
his O
stupidity O
, O
proved O
that O
he O
was O
generally O
different O
, O
which O
her O
own O
knowledge O
of O
him O
could O
not O
have O
told O
her O
; O
and O
as O
she O
would O
have O
liked O
to O
believe O
this O
change O
the O
effect O
of O
love O
, O
and O
the O
object O
of O
that O
love O
, O
her O
friend O
Eliza O
, O
she O
set O
herself O
seriously O
to O
work O
to O
find O
it O
out—She O
watched O
him O
whenever O
they O
were O
at O
Rosings O
, O
and O
whenever O
he O
came O
to O
Hunsford O
; O
but O
without O
much O
success O
. O
He O
certainly O
looked O
at O
her O
friend O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
but O
the O
expression O
of O
that O
look O
was O
disputable O
. O
It O
was O
an O
earnest O
, O
stedfast O
gaze O
, O
but O
she O
often O
doubted O
whether O
there O
were O
much O
admiration O
in O
it O
, O
and O
sometimes O
it O
seemed O
nothing O
but O
absence O
of O
mind O
. O
She O
had O
once O
or O
twice O
suggested O
to O
Elizabeth O
the O
possibility O
of O
his O
being O
partial O
to O
her O
, O
but O
Elizabeth O
always O
laughed O
at O
the O
idea O
; O
and O
Mrs. O
Collins O
did O
not O
think O
it O
right O
to O
press O
the O
subject O
from O
the O
danger O
of O
raising O
expectations O
which O
might O
only O
end O
in O
disappointment O
; O
for O
in O
her O
opinion O
it O
admitted O
not O
of O
a O
doubt O
, O
that O
all O
her O
friend O
's O
dislike O
would O
vanish O
, O
if O
she O
could O
suppose O
him O
to O
be O
in O
her O
power O
. O
In O
her O
kind O
schemes O
for O
Elizabeth O
, O
she O
sometimes O
planned O
her O
marrying O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
. O
He O
was O
, O
beyond O
comparison O
, O
the O
pleasantest O
man O
; O
he O
certainly O
admired O
her O
, O
and O
his O
situation O
in O
life O
was O
most O
eligible O
; O
but O
, O
to O
counterbalance O
these O
advantages O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
considerable O
patronage O
in O
the O
church O
, O
and O
his O
cousin O
could O
have O
none O
at O
all O
. O
