Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
's O
manners O
were O
very O
much O
admired O
at O
the O
Parsonage O
, O
and O
the O
ladies O
all O
felt O
that O
he O
must O
add O
considerably O
to O
the O
pleasure O
of O
their O
engagements O
at O
Rosings O
. O
It O
was O
some O
days O
, O
however O
, O
before O
they O
received O
any O
invitation O
thither O
, O
for O
while O
there O
were O
visitors O
in O
the O
house O
, O
they O
could O
not O
be O
necessary O
; O
and O
it O
was O
not O
till O
Easter-day O
, O
almost O
a O
week O
after O
the O
gentlemen O
's O
arrival O
, O
that O
they O
were O
honoured O
by O
such O
an O
attention O
, O
and O
then O
they O
were O
merely O
asked O
on O
leaving O
church O
to O
come O
there O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
For O
the O
last O
week O
they O
had O
seen O
very O
little O
of O
either O
Lady O
Catherine O
or O
her O
daughter O
. O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
had O
called O
at O
the O
Parsonage O
more O
than O
once O
during O
the O
time O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Darcy O
they O
had O
only O
seen O
at O
church O
. O
The O
invitation O
was O
accepted O
of O
course O
, O
and O
at O
a O
proper O
hour O
they O
joined O
the O
party O
in O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
drawing O
room O
. O
Her O
ladyship O
received O
them O
civilly O
, O
but O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
their O
company O
was O
by O
no O
means O
so O
acceptable O
as O
when O
she O
could O
get O
nobody O
else O
; O
and O
she O
was O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
almost O
engrossed O
by O
her O
nephews O
, O
speaking O
to O
them O
, O
especially O
to O
Darcy O
, O
much O
more O
than O
to O
any O
other O
person O
in O
the O
room O
. O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
seemed O
really O
glad O
to O
see O
them O
; O
any O
thing O
was O
a O
welcome O
relief O
to O
him O
at O
Rosings O
; O
and O
Mrs. O
Collins O
's O
pretty O
friend O
had O
moreover O
caught O
his O
fancy O
very O
much O
. O
He O
now O
seated O
himself O
by O
her O
, O
and O
talked O
so O
agreeably O
of O
Kent O
and O
Hertfordshire O
, O
of O
travelling O
and O
staying O
at O
home O
, O
of O
new O
books O
and O
music O
, O
that O
Elizabeth O
had O
never O
been O
half O
so O
well O
entertained O
in O
that O
room O
before O
; O
and O
they O
conversed O
with O
so O
much O
spirit O
and O
flow O
, O
as O
to O
draw O
the O
attention O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
herself O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
His O
eyes O
had O
been O
soon O
and O
repeatedly O
turned O
towards O
them O
with O
a O
look O
of O
curiosity O
; O
and O
that O
her O
ladyship O
, O
after O
a O
while O
, O
shared O
the O
feeling O
, O
was O
more O
openly O
acknowledged O
, O
for O
she O
did O
not O
scruple O
to O
call O
out O
, O
" O
What O
is O
that O
you O
are O
saying O
, O
Fitzwilliam O
? O
What O
is O
it O
you O
are O
talking O
of O
? O
What O
are O
you O
telling O
Miss O
Bennet O
? O
Let O
me O
hear O
what O
it O
is O
. O
" O
" O
We O
are O
speaking O
of O
music O
, O
madam O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
when O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
avoid O
a O
reply O
. O
" O
Of O
music O
! O
Then O
pray O
speak O
aloud O
. O
It O
is O
of O
all O
subjects O
my O
delight O
. O
I O
must O
have O
my O
share O
in O
the O
conversation O
, O
if O
you O
are O
speaking O
of O
music O
. O
There O
are O
few O
people O
in O
England O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
who O
have O
more O
true O
enjoyment O
of O
music O
than O
myself O
, O
or O
a O
better O
natural O
taste O
. O
If O
I O
had O
ever O
learnt O
, O
I O
should O
have O
been O
a O
great O
proficient O
. O
And O
so O
would O
Anne O
, O
if O
her O
health O
had O
allowed O
her O
to O
apply O
. O
I O
am O
confident O
that O
she O
would O
have O
performed O
delightfully O
. O
How O
does O
Georgiana O
get O
on O
, O
Darcy O
? O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
spoke O
with O
affectionate O
praise O
of O
his O
sister O
's O
proficiency O
. O
" O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
to O
hear O
such O
a O
good O
account O
of O
her O
, O
" O
said O
Lady O
Catherine O
; O
" O
and O
pray O
tell O
her O
from O
me O
, O
that O
she O
can O
not O
expect O
to O
excel O
, O
if O
she O
does O
not O
practise O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
" O
" O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
madam O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
that O
she O
does O
not O
need O
such O
advice O
. O
She O
practises O
very O
constantly O
. O
" O
" O
So O
much O
the O
better O
. O
It O
can O
not O
be O
done O
too O
much O
; O
and O
when O
I O
next O
write O
to O
her O
, O
I O
shall O
charge O
her O
not O
to O
neglect O
it O
on O
any O
account O
. O
I O
often O
tell O
young O
ladies O
, O
that O
no O
excellence O
in O
music O
is O
to O
be O
acquired O
, O
without O
constant O
practice O
. O
I O
have O
told O
Miss O
Bennet O
several O
times O
, O
that O
she O
will O
never O
play O
really O
well O
, O
unless O
she O
practises O
more O
; O
and O
though O
Mrs. O
Collins O
has O
no O
instrument O
, O
she O
is O
very O
welcome O
, O
as O
I O
have O
often O
told O
her O
, O
to O
come O
to O
Rosings O
every O
day O
, O
and O
play O
on O
the O
piano O
forte O
in O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
's O
room O
. O
She O
would O
be O
in O
nobody O
's O
way O
, O
you O
know O
, O
in O
that O
part O
of O
the O
house O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
looked O
a O
little O
ashamed O
of O
his O
aunt O
's O
ill O
breeding O
, O
and O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
When O
coffee O
was O
over O
, O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
reminded O
Elizabeth O
of O
having O
promised O
to O
play O
to O
him O
; O
and O
she O
sat O
down O
directly O
to O
the O
instrument O
. O
He O
drew O
a O
chair O
near O
her O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
listened O
to O
half O
a O
song O
, O
and O
then O
talked O
, O
as O
before O
, O
to O
her O
other O
nephew O
; O
till O
the O
latter O
walked O
away O
from O
her O
, O
and O
moving O
with O
his O
usual O
deliberation O
towards O
the O
piano O
forte O
, O
stationed O
himself O
so O
as O
to O
command O
a O
full O
view O
of O
the O
fair O
performer O
's O
countenance O
. O
Elizabeth O
saw O
what O
he O
was O
doing O
, O
and O
at O
the O
first O
convenient O
pause O
, O
turned O
to O
him O
with O
an O
arch O
smile O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
You O
mean O
to O
frighten O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
by O
coming O
in O
all O
this O
state O
to O
hear O
me O
? O
But O
I O
will O
not O
be O
alarmed O
though O
your O
sister O
does O
play O
so O
well O
. O
There O
is O
a O
stubbornness O
about O
me O
that O
never O
can O
bear O
to O
be O
frightened O
at O
the O
will O
of O
others O
. O
My O
courage O
always O
rises O
with O
every O
attempt O
to O
intimidate O
me O
. O
" O
" O
I O
shall O
not O
say O
that O
you O
are O
mistaken O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
because O
you O
could O
not O
really O
believe O
me O
to O
entertain O
any O
design O
of O
alarming O
you O
; O
and O
I O
have O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
your O
acquaintance O
long O
enough O
to O
know O
, O
that O
you O
find O
great O
enjoyment O
in O
occasionally O
professing O
opinions O
which O
in O
fact O
are O
not O
your O
own O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
laughed O
heartily O
at O
this O
picture O
of O
herself O
, O
and O
said O
to O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
" O
Your O
cousin O
will O
give O
you O
a O
very O
pretty O
notion O
of O
me O
, O
and O
teach O
you O
not O
to O
believe O
a O
word O
I O
say O
. O
I O
am O
particularly O
unlucky O
in O
meeting O
with O
a O
person O
so O
well O
able O
to O
expose O
my O
real O
character O
, O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
where O
I O
had O
hoped O
to O
pass O
myself O
off O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
credit O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
it O
is O
very O
ungenerous O
in O
you O
to O
mention O
all O
that O
you O
knew O
to O
my O
disadvantage O
in O
Hertfordshire—and O
, O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
say O
, O
very O
impolitic O
too—for O
it O
is O
provoking O
me O
to O
retaliate O
, O
and O
such O
things O
may O
come O
out O
, O
as O
will O
shock O
your O
relations O
to O
hear O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
of O
you O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
smilingly O
. O
" O
Pray O
let O
me O
hear O
what O
you O
have O
to O
accuse O
him O
of O
, O
" O
cried O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
. O
" O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
how O
he O
behaves O
among O
strangers O
. O
" O
" O
You O
shall O
hear O
then—but O
prepare O
for O
something O
very O
dreadful O
. O
The O
first O
time O
of O
my O
ever O
seeing O
him O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
you O
must O
know O
, O
was O
at O
a O
ball—and O
at O
this O
ball O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
he O
did O
? O
He O
danced O
only O
four O
dances O
! O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
pain O
you—but O
so O
it O
was O
. O
He O
danced O
only O
four O
dances O
, O
though O
gentlemen O
were O
scarce O
; O
and O
, O
to O
my O
certain O
knowledge O
, O
more O
than O
one O
young O
lady O
was O
sitting O
down O
in O
want O
of O
a O
partner O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
you O
can O
not O
deny O
the O
fact O
. O
" O
" O
I O
had O
not O
at O
that O
time O
the O
honour O
of O
knowing O
any O
lady O
in O
the O
assembly O
beyond O
my O
own O
party O
. O
" O
" O
True O
; O
and O
nobody O
can O
ever O
be O
introduced O
in O
a O
ball O
room O
. O
Well O
, O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
what O
do O
I O
play O
next O
? O
My O
fingers O
wait O
your O
orders O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
, O
" O
I O
should O
have O
judged O
better O
, O
had O
I O
sought O
an O
introduction O
, O
but O
I O
am O
ill O
qualified O
to O
recommend O
myself O
to O
strangers O
. O
" O
" O
Shall O
we O
ask O
your O
cousin O
the O
reason O
of O
this O
? O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
still O
addressing O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
. O
" O
Shall O
we O
ask O
him O
why O
a O
man O
of O
sense O
and O
education O
, O
and O
who O
has O
lived O
in O
the O
world O
, O
is O
ill-qualified O
to O
recommend O
himself O
to O
strangers O
? O
" O
" O
I O
can O
answer O
your O
question O
, O
" O
said O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
" O
without O
applying O
to O
him O
. O
It O
is O
because O
he O
will O
not O
give O
himself O
the O
trouble O
. O
" O
" O
I O
certainly O
have O
not O
the O
talent O
which O
some O
people O
possess O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
, O
" O
of O
conversing O
easily O
with O
those O
I O
have O
never O
seen O
before O
. O
I O
can O
not O
catch O
their O
tone O
of O
conversation O
, O
or O
appear O
interested O
in O
their O
concerns O
, O
as O
I O
often O
see O
done O
. O
" O
" O
My O
fingers O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
do O
not O
move O
over O
this O
instrument O
in O
the O
masterly O
manner O
which O
I O
see O
so O
many O
women O
's O
do O
. O
They O
have O
not O
the O
same O
force O
or O
rapidity O
, O
and O
do O
not O
produce O
the O
same O
expression O
. O
But O
then O
I O
have O
always O
supposed O
it O
to O
be O
my O
own O
fault—because O
I O
would O
not O
take O
the O
trouble O
of O
practising O
. O
It O
is O
not O
that O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
my O
fingers O
as O
capable O
as O
any O
other O
woman O
's O
of O
superior O
execution O
. O
" O
Darcy O
smiled O
and O
said O
, O
" O
You O
are O
perfectly O
right O
. O
You O
have O
employed O
your O
time O
much O
better O
. O
No O
one O
admitted O
to O
the O
privilege O
of O
hearing O
you O
can O
think O
any O
thing O
wanting O
. O
We O
neither O
of O
us O
perform O
to O
strangers O
. O
" O
Here O
they O
were O
interrupted O
by O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
who O
called O
out O
to O
know O
what O
they O
were O
talking O
of O
. O
Elizabeth O
immediately O
began O
playing O
again O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
approached O
, O
and O
, O
after O
listening O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
said O
to O
Darcy O
, O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
would O
not O
play O
at O
all O
amiss O
, O
if O
she O
practised O
more O
, O
and O
could O
have O
the O
advantage O
of O
a O
London O
Master O
. O
She O
has O
a O
very O
good O
notion O
of O
fingering O
, O
though O
her O
taste O
is O
not O
equal O
to O
Anne O
's O
. O
Anne O
would O
have O
been O
a O
delightful O
performer O
, O
had O
her O
health O
allowed O
her O
to O
learn O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
looked O
at O
Darcy O
to O
see O
how O
cordially O
he O
assented O
to O
his O
cousin O
's O
praise O
; O
but O
neither O
at O
that O
moment O
nor O
at O
any O
other O
could O
she O
discern O
any O
symptom O
of O
love O
; O
and O
from O
the O
whole O
of O
his O
behaviour O
to O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
she O
derived O
this O
comfort O
for O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
that O
he O
might O
have O
been O
just O
as O
likely O
to O
marry O
her O
, O
had O
she O
been O
his O
relation O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
continued O
her O
remarks O
on O
Elizabeth O
's O
performance O
, O
mixing O
with O
them O
many O
instructions O
on O
execution O
and O
taste O
. O
Elizabeth O
received O
them O
with O
all O
the O
forbearance O
of O
civility O
; O
and O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
gentlemen O
remained O
at O
the O
instrument O
till O
her O
ladyship O
's O
carriage O
was O
ready O
to O
take O
them O
all O
home O
. O
