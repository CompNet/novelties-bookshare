Mr. O
Collins O
was O
not O
a O
sensible O
man O
, O
and O
the O
deficiency O
of O
nature O
had O
been O
but O
little O
assisted O
by O
education O
or O
society O
; O
the O
greatest O
part O
of O
his O
life O
having O
been O
spent O
under O
the O
guidance O
of O
an O
illiterate O
and O
miserly O
father O
; O
and O
though O
he O
belonged O
to O
one O
of O
the O
universities O
, O
he O
had O
merely O
kept O
the O
necessary O
terms O
, O
without O
forming O
at O
it O
any O
useful O
acquaintance O
. O
The O
subjection O
in O
which O
his O
father O
had O
brought O
him O
up O
, O
had O
given O
him O
originally O
great O
humility O
of O
manner O
, O
but O
it O
was O
now O
a O
good O
deal O
counteracted O
by O
the O
self-conceit O
of O
a O
weak O
head O
, O
living O
in O
retirement O
, O
and O
the O
consequential O
feelings O
of O
early O
and O
unexpected O
prosperity O
. O
A O
fortunate O
chance O
had O
recommended O
him O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
when O
the O
living O
of O
Hunsford O
was O
vacant O
; O
and O
the O
respect O
which O
he O
felt O
for O
her O
high O
rank O
, O
and O
his O
veneration O
for O
her O
as O
his O
patroness O
, O
mingling O
with O
a O
very O
good O
opinion O
of O
himself O
, O
of O
his O
authority O
as O
a O
clergyman O
, O
and O
his O
right O
as O
a O
rector O
, O
made O
him O
altogether O
a O
mixture O
of O
pride O
and O
obsequiousness O
, O
self-importance O
and O
humility O
. O
Having O
now O
a O
good O
house O
and O
very O
suffi- O
cient O
income O
, O
he O
intended O
to O
marry O
; O
and O
in O
seeking O
a O
reconciliation O
with O
the O
Longbourn O
family O
he O
had O
a O
wife O
in O
view O
, O
as O
he O
meant O
to O
chuse O
one O
of O
the O
daughters O
, O
if O
he O
found O
them O
as O
handsome O
and O
amiable O
as O
they O
were O
represented O
by O
common O
report O
. O
This O
was O
his O
plan O
of O
amends—of O
atonement—for O
inheriting O
their O
father O
's O
estate O
; O
and O
he O
thought O
it O
an O
excellent O
one O
, O
full O
of O
eligibility O
and O
suitableness O
, O
and O
excessively O
generous O
and O
disinterested O
on O
his O
own O
part O
. O
His O
plan O
did O
not O
vary O
on O
seeing O
them.—Miss O
Bennet O
's O
lovely O
face O
confirmed O
his O
views O
, O
and O
established O
all O
his O
strictest O
notions O
of O
what O
was O
due O
to O
seniority O
; O
and O
for O
the O
first O
evening O
she O
was O
his O
settled O
choice O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
, O
however O
, O
made O
an O
alteration O
; O
for O
in O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
's O
tête-à-tête O
with O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
before O
breakfast O
, O
a O
conversation O
beginning O
with O
his O
parsonage-house O
, O
and O
leading O
naturally O
to O
the O
avowal O
of O
his O
hopes O
, O
that O
a O
mistress O
for O
it O
might O
be O
found O
at O
Longbourn O
, O
produced O
from O
her O
, O
amid O
very O
complaisant O
smiles O
and O
general O
encouragement O
, O
a O
caution O
against O
the O
very O
Jane O
he O
had O
fixed O
on.— O
" O
As O
to O
her O
younger O
daughters O
she O
could O
not O
take O
upon O
her O
to O
say—she O
could O
not O
positively O
answer—but O
she O
did O
not O
know O
of O
any O
prepos- O
session O
; O
—her O
eldest O
daughter O
, O
she O
must O
just O
mention—she O
felt O
it O
incumbent O
on O
her O
to O
hint O
, O
was O
likely O
to O
be O
very O
soon O
engaged O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Collins O
had O
only O
to O
change O
from O
Jane O
to O
Elizabeth—and O
it O
was O
soon O
done—done O
while O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
stirring O
the O
fire.—Elizabeth O
, O
equally O
next O
to O
Jane O
in O
birth O
and O
beauty O
, O
succeeded O
her O
of O
course O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
treasured O
up O
the O
hint O
, O
and O
trusted O
that O
she O
might O
soon O
have O
two O
daughters O
married O
; O
and O
the O
man O
whom O
she O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
day O
before O
, O
was O
now O
high O
in O
her O
good O
graces O
. O
Lydia O
's O
intention O
of O
walking O
to O
Meryton O
was O
not O
forgotten O
; O
every O
sister O
except O
Mary O
agreed O
to O
go O
with O
her O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
to O
attend O
them O
, O
at O
the O
request O
of O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
who O
was O
most O
anxious O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him O
, O
and O
have O
his O
library O
to O
himself O
; O
for O
thither O
Mr. O
Collins O
had O
followed O
him O
after O
breakfast O
, O
and O
there O
he O
would O
continue O
, O
nominally O
engaged O
with O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
folios O
in O
the O
collection O
, O
but O
really O
talking O
to O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
with O
little O
cessation O
, O
of O
his O
house O
and O
garden O
at O
Hunsford O
. O
Such O
doings O
discomposed O
Mr. O
Bennet O
exceedingly O
. O
In O
his O
library O
he O
had O
been O
always O
sure O
of O
leisure O
and O
tranquillity O
; O
and O
though O
prepared O
, O
as O
he O
told O
Elizabeth O
, O
to O
meet O
with O
folly O
and O
conceit O
in O
every O
other O
room O
in O
the O
house O
, O
he O
was O
used O
to O
be O
free O
from O
them O
there O
; O
his O
civility O
, O
therefore O
, O
was O
most O
prompt O
in O
inviting O
Mr. O
Collins O
to O
join O
his O
daughters O
in O
their O
walk O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
being O
in O
fact O
much O
better O
fitted O
for O
a O
walker O
than O
a O
reader O
, O
was O
extremely O
well O
pleased O
to O
close O
his O
large O
book O
, O
and O
go O
. O
In O
pompous O
nothings O
on O
his O
side O
, O
and O
civil O
assents O
on O
that O
of O
his O
cousins O
, O
their O
time O
passed O
till O
they O
entered O
Meryton O
. O
The O
attention O
of O
the O
younger O
ones O
was O
then O
no O
longer O
to O
be O
gained O
by O
him O
. O
Their O
eyes O
were O
immediately O
wandering O
up O
in O
the O
street O
in O
quest O
of O
the O
officers O
, O
and O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
very O
smart O
bonnet O
indeed O
, O
or O
a O
really O
new O
muslin O
in O
a O
shop O
window O
, O
could O
recal O
them O
. O
But O
the O
attention O
of O
every O
lady O
was O
soon O
caught O
by O
a O
young O
man O
, O
whom O
they O
had O
never O
seen O
before O
, O
of O
most O
gentlemanlike O
appearance O
, O
walking O
with O
an O
officer O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
way O
. O
The O
officer O
was O
the O
very O
Mr. O
Denny O
, O
concerning O
whose O
return O
from O
London O
Lydia O
came O
to O
inquire O
, O
and O
he O
bowed O
as O
they O
passed O
. O
All O
were O
struck O
with O
the O
stranger O
's O
air O
, O
all O
wondered O
who O
he O
could O
be O
; O
and O
Kitty O
and O
Lydia O
, O
determined O
if O
possible O
to O
find O
out O
, O
led O
the O
way O
across O
the O
street O
, O
under O
pretence O
of O
wanting O
something O
in O
an O
opposite O
shop O
, O
and O
fortunately O
had O
just O
gained O
the O
pavement O
when O
the O
two O
gentlemen O
turning O
back O
had O
reached O
the O
same O
spot O
. O
Mr. O
Denny O
addressed O
them O
directly O
, O
and O
entreated O
permission O
to O
introduce O
his O
friend O
, O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
who O
had O
returned O
with O
him O
the O
day O
before O
from O
town O
, O
and O
he O
was O
happy O
to O
say O
had O
accepted O
a O
commission O
in O
their O
corps O
. O
This O
was O
exactly O
as O
it O
should O
be O
; O
for O
the O
young O
man O
wanted O
only O
regimentals O
to O
make O
him O
completely O
charming O
. O
His O
appearance O
was O
greatly O
in O
his O
favour O
; O
he O
had O
all O
the O
best O
part O
of O
beauty O
, O
a O
fine O
countenance O
, O
a O
good O
figure O
, O
and O
very O
pleasing O
address O
. O
The O
introduction O
was O
followed O
up O
on O
his O
side O
by O
a O
happy O
readiness O
of O
conversation—a O
readiness O
at O
the O
same O
time O
perfectly O
correct O
and O
unassuming O
; O
and O
the O
whole O
party O
were O
still O
standing O
and O
talking O
together O
very O
agreeably O
, O
when O
the O
sound O
of O
horses O
drew O
their O
notice O
, O
and O
Darcy O
and O
Bingley O
were O
seen O
riding O
down O
the O
street O
. O
On O
distinguishing O
the O
ladies O
of O
the O
group O
, O
the O
two O
gentlemen O
came O
directly O
towards O
them O
, O
and O
began O
the O
usual O
civilities O
. O
Bingley O
was O
the O
principal O
spokesman O
, O
and O
Miss O
Bennet O
the O
principal O
object O
. O
He O
was O
then O
, O
he O
said O
, O
on O
his O
way O
to O
Longbourn O
on O
purpose O
to O
inquire O
after O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
corroborated O
it O
with O
a O
bow O
, O
and O
was O
beginning O
to O
determine O
not O
to O
fix O
his O
eyes O
on O
Elizabeth O
, O
when O
they O
were O
suddenly O
arrested O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
stranger O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
happening O
to O
see O
the O
countenance O
of O
both O
as O
they O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
, O
was O
all O
astonishment O
at O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
meeting O
. O
Both O
changed O
colour O
, O
one O
looked O
white O
, O
the O
other O
red O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
after O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
touched O
his O
hat—a O
salutation O
which O
Mr. O
Darcy O
just O
deigned O
to O
return O
. O
What O
could O
be O
the O
meaning O
of O
it O
? O
—It O
was O
impossible O
to O
imagine O
; O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
long O
to O
know O
. O
In O
another O
minute O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
but O
without O
seeming O
to O
have O
noticed O
what O
passed O
, O
took O
leave O
and O
rode O
on O
with O
his O
friend O
. O
Mr. O
Denny O
and O
Mr. O
Wickham O
walked O
with O
the O
young O
ladies O
to O
the O
door O
of O
Mr. O
Philips O
's O
house O
, O
and O
then O
made O
their O
bows O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
Miss O
Lydia O
's O
pressing O
entreaties O
that O
they O
would O
come O
in O
, O
and O
even O
in O
spite O
of O
Mrs. O
Philips O
's O
throwing O
up O
the O
parlour O
window O
, O
and O
loudly O
seconding O
the O
invitation O
. O
Mrs. O
Philips O
was O
always O
glad O
to O
see O
her O
nieces O
; O
and O
the O
two O
eldest O
, O
from O
their O
recent O
absence O
, O
were O
particularly O
welcome O
, O
and O
she O
was O
eagerly O
expressing O
her O
surprise O
at O
their O
sudden O
return O
home O
, O
which O
, O
as O
their O
own O
carriage O
had O
not O
fetched O
them O
, O
she O
should O
have O
known O
nothing O
about O
, O
if O
she O
had O
not O
happened O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Jones O
's O
shop-boy O
in O
the O
street O
, O
who O
had O
told O
her O
that O
they O
were O
not O
to O
send O
any O
more O
draughts O
to O
Netherfield O
because O
the O
Miss O
Bennets O
were O
come O
away O
, O
when O
her O
civility O
was O
claimed O
towards O
Mr. O
Collins O
by O
Jane O
's O
introduction O
of O
him O
. O
She O
received O
him O
with O
her O
very O
best O
politeness O
, O
which O
he O
returned O
with O
as O
much O
more O
, O
apologising O
for O
his O
intrusion O
, O
without O
any O
previous O
acquaintance O
with O
her O
, O
which O
he O
could O
not O
help O
flattering O
himself O
however O
might O
be O
justified O
by O
his O
relationship O
to O
the O
young O
ladies O
who O
introduced O
him O
to O
her O
notice O
. O
Mrs. O
Philips O
was O
quite O
awed O
by O
such O
an O
excess O
of O
good O
breeding O
; O
but O
her O
contemplation O
of O
one O
stranger O
was O
soon O
put O
an O
end O
to O
by O
exclamations O
and O
inquiries O
about O
the O
other O
, O
of O
whom O
, O
however O
, O
she O
could O
only O
tell O
her O
nieces O
what O
they O
already O
knew O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Denny O
had O
brought O
him O
from O
London O
, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
to O
have O
a O
lieutenant O
's O
commission O
in O
the O
——————shire O
. O
She O
had O
been O
watching O
him O
the O
last O
hour O
, O
she O
said O
, O
as O
he O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
street O
, O
and O
had O
Mr. O
Wickham O
appeared O
Kitty O
and O
Lydia O
would O
certainly O
have O
continued O
the O
occupation O
, O
but O
unluckily O
no O
one O
passed O
the O
windows O
now O
except O
a O
few O
of O
the O
officers O
, O
who O
, O
in O
comparison O
with O
the O
stranger O
, O
were O
become O
" O
stupid O
, O
disagreeable O
fellows O
. O
" O
Some O
of O
them O
were O
to O
dine O
with O
the O
Philipses O
the O
next O
day O
, O
and O
their O
aunt O
promised O
to O
make O
her O
husband O
call O
on O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
and O
give O
him O
an O
invitation O
also O
, O
if O
the O
family O
from O
Longbourn O
would O
come O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
This O
was O
agreed O
to O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Philips O
protested O
that O
they O
would O
have O
a O
nice O
comfortable O
noisy O
game O
of O
lottery O
tickets O
, O
and O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
hot O
supper O
afterwards O
. O
The O
prospect O
of O
such O
delights O
was O
very O
cheering O
, O
and O
they O
parted O
in O
mutual O
good O
spirits O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
repeated O
his O
apologies O
in O
quitting O
the O
room O
, O
and O
was O
assured O
with O
unwearying O
civility O
that O
they O
were O
perfectly O
needless O
. O
As O
they O
walked O
home O
, O
Elizabeth O
related O
to O
Jane O
what O
she O
had O
seen O
pass O
between O
the O
two O
gentlemen O
; O
but O
though O
Jane O
would O
have O
defended O
either O
or O
both O
, O
had O
they O
appeared O
to O
be O
wrong O
, O
she O
could O
no O
more O
explain O
such O
behaviour O
than O
her O
sister O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
on O
his O
return O
highly O
gratified O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
by O
admiring O
Mrs. O
Philips O
's O
manners O
and O
politeness O
. O
He O
protested O
that O
except O
Lady O
Catherine O
and O
her O
daughter O
, O
he O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
more O
elegant O
woman O
; O
for O
she O
had O
not O
only O
received O
him O
with O
the O
utmost O
civility O
, O
but O
had O
even O
pointedly O
included O
him O
in O
her O
invitation O
for O
the O
next O
evening O
, O
although O
utterly O
unknown O
to O
her O
before O
. O
Something O
he O
supposed O
might O
be O
attributed O
to O
his O
connection O
with O
them O
, O
but O
yet O
he O
had O
never O
met O
with O
so O
much O
attention O
in O
the O
whole O
course O
of O
his O
life O
. O
