The O
ladies O
of O
Longbourn O
soon O
waited O
on O
those O
of O
Netherfield O
. O
The O
visit O
was O
returned O
in O
due O
form O
. O
Miss O
Bennet O
's O
pleasing O
manners O
grew O
on O
the O
good-will O
of O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
; O
and O
though O
the O
mother O
was O
found O
to O
be O
intolerable O
and O
the O
younger O
sisters O
not O
worth O
speaking O
to O
, O
a O
wish O
of O
being O
better O
acquainted O
with O
them O
, O
was O
expressed O
towards O
the O
two O
eldest O
. O
By O
Jane O
this O
attention O
was O
received O
with O
the O
greatest O
pleasure O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
still O
saw O
superciliousness O
in O
their O
treatment O
of O
every O
body O
, O
hardly O
excepting O
even O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
could O
not O
like O
them O
; O
though O
their O
kindness O
to O
Jane O
, O
such O
as O
it O
was O
, O
had O
a O
value O
as O
arising O
in O
all O
probability O
from O
the O
influence O
of O
their O
brother O
's O
admiration O
. O
It O
was O
generally O
evident O
whenever O
they O
met O
, O
that O
he O
did O
admire O
her O
; O
and O
to O
her O
it O
was O
equally O
evident O
that O
Jane O
was O
yielding O
to O
the O
preference O
which O
she O
had O
begun O
to O
entertain O
for O
him O
from O
the O
first O
, O
and O
was O
in O
a O
way O
to O
be O
very O
much O
in O
love O
; O
but O
she O
considered O
with O
pleasure O
that O
it O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
discovered O
by O
the O
world O
in O
general O
, O
since O
Jane O
united O
with O
great O
strength O
of O
feeling O
, O
a O
composure O
of O
temper O
and O
a O
uniform O
cheerfulness O
of O
manner O
, O
which O
would O
guard O
her O
from O
the O
suspicions O
of O
the O
impertinent O
. O
She O
mentioned O
this O
to O
her O
friend O
Miss O
Lucas O
. O
" O
It O
may O
perhaps O
be O
pleasant O
, O
" O
replied O
Charlotte O
, O
" O
to O
be O
able O
to O
impose O
on O
the O
public O
in O
such O
a O
case O
; O
but O
it O
is O
sometimes O
a O
disadvantage O
to O
be O
so O
very O
guarded O
. O
If O
a O
woman O
conceals O
her O
affection O
with O
the O
same O
skill O
from O
the O
object O
of O
it O
, O
she O
may O
lose O
the O
opportunity O
of O
fixing O
him O
; O
and O
it O
will O
then O
be O
but O
poor O
consolation O
to O
believe O
the O
world O
equally O
in O
the O
dark O
. O
There O
is O
so O
much O
of O
gratitude O
or O
vanity O
in O
almost O
every O
attachment O
, O
that O
it O
is O
not O
safe O
to O
leave O
any O
to O
itself O
. O
We O
can O
all O
begin O
freely—a O
slight O
preference O
is O
natural O
enough O
; O
but O
there O
are O
very O
few O
of O
us O
who O
have O
heart O
enough O
to O
be O
really O
in O
love O
without O
encouragement O
. O
In O
nine O
cases O
out O
of O
ten O
, O
a O
woman O
had O
better O
shew O
more O
affection O
than O
she O
feels O
. O
Bingley O
likes O
your O
sister O
undoubtedly O
; O
but O
he O
may O
never O
do O
more O
than O
like O
her O
, O
if O
she O
does O
not O
help O
him O
on O
. O
" O
" O
But O
she O
does O
help O
him O
on O
, O
as O
much O
as O
her O
nature O
will O
allow O
. O
If O
I O
can O
perceive O
her O
regard O
for O
him O
, O
he O
must O
be O
a O
simpleton O
indeed O
not O
to O
discover O
it O
too O
. O
" O
" O
Remember O
, O
Eliza O
, O
that O
he O
does O
not O
know O
Jane O
's O
disposition O
as O
you O
do O
. O
" O
" O
But O
if O
a O
woman O
is O
partial O
to O
a O
man O
, O
and O
does O
not O
endeavour O
to O
conceal O
it O
, O
he O
must O
find O
it O
out O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
he O
must O
, O
if O
he O
sees O
enough O
of O
her O
. O
But O
though O
Bingley O
and O
Jane O
meet O
tolerably O
often O
, O
it O
is O
never O
for O
many O
hours O
together O
; O
and O
as O
they O
always O
see O
each O
other O
in O
large O
mixed O
parties O
, O
it O
is O
impossible O
that O
every O
moment O
should O
be O
employed O
in O
conversing O
together O
. O
Jane O
should O
therefore O
make O
the O
most O
of O
every O
half O
hour O
in O
which O
she O
can O
command O
his O
attention O
. O
When O
she O
is O
secure O
of O
him O
, O
there O
will O
be O
leisure O
for O
falling O
in O
love O
as O
much O
as O
she O
chooses O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
plan O
is O
a O
good O
one O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
where O
nothing O
is O
in O
question O
but O
the O
desire O
of O
being O
well O
married O
; O
and O
if O
I O
were O
determined O
to O
get O
a O
rich O
husband O
, O
or O
any O
husband O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
I O
should O
adopt O
it O
. O
But O
these O
are O
not O
Jane O
's O
feelings O
; O
she O
is O
not O
acting O
by O
design O
. O
As O
yet O
she O
can O
not O
even O
be O
certain O
of O
the O
degree O
of O
her O
own O
regard O
, O
nor O
of O
its O
reasonableness O
. O
She O
has O
known O
him O
only O
a O
fortnight O
. O
She O
danced O
four O
dances O
with O
him O
at O
Meryton O
; O
she O
saw O
him O
one O
morning O
at O
his O
own O
house O
, O
and O
has O
since O
dined O
in O
company O
with O
him O
four O
times O
. O
This O
is O
not O
quite O
enough O
to O
make O
her O
understand O
his O
character O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
as O
you O
represent O
it O
. O
Had O
she O
merely O
dined O
with O
him O
, O
she O
might O
only O
have O
discovered O
whether O
he O
had O
a O
good O
appetite O
; O
but O
you O
must O
remember O
that O
four O
evenings O
have O
been O
also O
spent O
together—and O
four O
evenings O
may O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
these O
four O
evenings O
have O
enabled O
them O
to O
ascertain O
that O
they O
both O
like O
Vingt-un O
better O
than O
Commerce O
; O
but O
with O
respect O
to O
any O
other O
leading O
characteristic O
, O
I O
do O
not O
imagine O
that O
much O
has O
been O
unfolded O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
" O
said O
Charlotte O
, O
" O
I O
wish O
Jane O
success O
with O
all O
my O
heart O
; O
and O
if O
she O
were O
married O
to O
him O
to-morrow O
, O
I O
should O
think O
she O
had O
as O
good O
a O
chance O
of O
happiness O
, O
as O
if O
she O
were O
to O
be O
studying O
his O
character O
for O
a O
twelvemonth O
. O
Happiness O
in O
marriage O
is O
entirely O
a O
matter O
of O
chance O
. O
If O
the O
dispositions O
of O
the O
parties O
are O
ever O
so O
well O
known O
to O
each O
other O
, O
or O
ever O
so O
similar O
before-hand O
, O
it O
does O
not O
advance O
their O
felicity O
in O
the O
least O
. O
They O
always O
continue O
to O
grow O
sufficiently O
unlike O
afterwards O
to O
have O
their O
share O
of O
vexation O
; O
and O
it O
is O
better O
to O
know O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
of O
the O
defects O
of O
the O
person O
with O
whom O
you O
are O
to O
pass O
your O
life O
. O
" O
" O
You O
make O
me O
laugh O
, O
Charlotte O
; O
but O
it O
is O
not O
sound O
. O
You O
know O
it O
is O
not O
sound O
, O
and O
that O
you O
would O
never O
act O
in O
this O
way O
yourself O
. O
" O
Occupied O
in O
observing O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
attentions O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
far O
from O
suspecting O
that O
she O
was O
herself O
becoming O
an O
object O
of O
some O
interest O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
his O
friend O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
at O
first O
scarcely O
allowed O
her O
to O
be O
pretty O
; O
he O
had O
looked O
at O
her O
without O
admiration O
at O
the O
ball O
; O
and O
when O
they O
next O
met O
, O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
only O
to O
criticise O
. O
But O
no O
sooner O
had O
he O
made O
it O
clear O
to O
himself O
and O
his O
friends O
that O
she O
had O
hardly O
a O
good O
feature O
in O
her O
face O
, O
than O
he O
began O
to O
find O
it O
was O
rendered O
uncommonly O
intelligent O
by O
the O
beautiful O
expression O
of O
her O
dark O
eyes O
. O
To O
this O
discovery O
succeeded O
some O
others O
equally O
mortifying O
. O
Though O
he O
had O
detected O
with O
a O
critical O
eye O
more O
than O
one O
failure O
of O
perfect O
symmetry O
in O
her O
form O
, O
he O
was O
forced O
to O
acknowledge O
her O
figure O
to O
be O
light O
and O
pleasing O
; O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
asserting O
that O
her O
manners O
were O
not O
those O
of O
the O
fashionable O
world O
, O
he O
was O
caught O
by O
their O
easy O
playfulness O
. O
Of O
this O
she O
was O
perfectly O
unaware O
; O
—to O
her O
he O
was O
only O
the O
man O
who O
made O
himself O
agreeable O
no O
where O
, O
and O
who O
had O
not O
thought O
her O
handsome O
enough O
to O
dance O
with O
. O
He O
began O
to O
wish O
to O
know O
more O
of O
her O
, O
and O
as O
a O
step O
towards O
conversing O
with O
her O
himself O
, O
attended O
to O
her O
conversation O
with O
others O
. O
His O
doing O
so O
drew O
her O
notice O
. O
It O
was O
at O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
's O
, O
where O
a O
large O
party O
were O
assembled O
. O
" O
What O
does O
Mr. O
Darcy O
mean O
, O
" O
said O
she O
to O
Charlotte O
, O
" O
by O
listening O
to O
my O
conversation O
with O
Colonel O
Forster O
? O
" O
" O
That O
is O
a O
question O
which O
Mr. O
Darcy O
only O
can O
answer O
. O
" O
" O
But O
if O
he O
does O
it O
any O
more O
I O
shall O
certainly O
let O
him O
know O
that O
I O
see O
what O
he O
is O
about O
. O
He O
has O
a O
very O
satirical O
eye O
, O
and O
if O
I O
do O
not O
begin O
by O
being O
impertinent O
myself O
, O
I O
shall O
soon O
grow O
afraid O
of O
him O
. O
" O
On O
his O
approaching O
them O
soon O
afterwards O
, O
though O
without O
seeming O
to O
have O
any O
intention O
of O
speaking O
, O
Miss O
Lucas O
defied O
her O
friend O
to O
mention O
such O
a O
subject O
to O
him O
, O
which O
immediately O
provoking O
Elizabeth O
to O
do O
it O
, O
she O
turned O
to O
him O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Did O
not O
you O
think O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
that O
I O
expressed O
myself O
uncommonly O
well O
just O
now O
, O
when O
I O
was O
teasing O
Colonel O
Forster O
to O
give O
us O
a O
ball O
at O
Meryton O
? O
" O
" O
With O
great O
energy O
; O
—but O
it O
is O
a O
subject O
which O
always O
makes O
a O
lady O
energetic O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
severe O
on O
us O
. O
" O
" O
It O
will O
be O
her O
turn O
soon O
to O
be O
teased O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Lucas O
. O
" O
I O
am O
going O
to O
open O
the O
instrument O
, O
Eliza O
, O
and O
you O
know O
what O
follows O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
a O
very O
strange O
creature O
by O
way O
of O
a O
friend O
! O
—always O
wanting O
me O
to O
play O
and O
sing O
before O
any O
body O
and O
every O
body O
! O
—If O
my O
vanity O
had O
taken O
a O
musical O
turn O
, O
you O
would O
have O
been O
invaluable O
, O
but O
as O
it O
is O
, O
I O
would O
really O
rather O
not O
sit O
down O
before O
those O
who O
must O
be O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
hearing O
the O
very O
best O
performers O
. O
" O
On O
Miss O
Lucas O
's O
persevering O
, O
however O
, O
she O
added O
, O
" O
Very O
well O
; O
if O
it O
must O
be O
so O
, O
it O
must O
. O
" O
And O
gravely O
glancing O
at O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
" O
There O
is O
a O
fine O
old O
saying O
, O
which O
every O
body O
here O
is O
of O
course O
familiar O
with—'Keep O
your O
breath O
to O
cool O
your O
porridge O
, O
'—and O
I O
shall O
keep O
mine O
to O
swell O
my O
song O
. O
" O
Her O
performance O
was O
pleasing O
, O
though O
by O
no O
means O
capital O
. O
After O
a O
song O
or O
two O
, O
and O
before O
she O
could O
reply O
to O
the O
entreaties O
of O
several O
that O
she O
would O
sing O
again O
, O
she O
was O
eagerly O
succeeded O
at O
the O
instrument O
by O
her O
sister O
Mary O
, O
who O
having O
, O
in O
consequence O
of O
being O
the O
only O
plain O
one O
in O
the O
family O
, O
worked O
hard O
for O
knowledge O
and O
accomplishments O
, O
was O
always O
impatient O
for O
display O
. O
Mary O
had O
neither O
genius O
nor O
taste O
; O
and O
though O
vanity O
had O
given O
her O
application O
, O
it O
had O
given O
her O
likewise O
a O
pedantic O
air O
and O
conceited O
manner O
, O
which O
would O
have O
injured O
a O
higher O
degree O
of O
excellence O
than O
she O
had O
reached.—Elizabeth O
, O
easy O
and O
unaffected O
, O
had O
been O
listened O
to O
with O
much O
more O
pleasure O
, O
though O
not O
playing O
half O
so O
well O
; O
and O
Mary O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
long O
concerto O
, O
was O
glad O
to O
purchase O
praise O
and O
gratitude O
by O
Scotch O
and O
Irish O
airs O
, O
at O
the O
request O
of O
her O
younger O
sisters O
, O
who O
with O
some O
of O
the O
Lucases O
and O
two O
or O
three O
officers O
joined O
eagerly O
in O
dancing O
at O
one O
end O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
stood O
near O
them O
in O
silent O
indignation O
at O
such O
a O
mode O
of O
passing O
the O
evening O
, O
to O
the O
exclusion O
of O
all O
conversation O
, O
and O
was O
too O
much O
engrossed O
by O
his O
own O
thoughts O
to O
perceive O
that O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
was O
his O
neighbour O
, O
till O
Sir O
William O
thus O
began O
: O
" O
What O
a O
charming O
amusement O
for O
young O
people O
this O
is O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
! O
—There O
is O
nothing O
like O
dancing O
after O
all.—I O
consider O
it O
as O
one O
of O
the O
first O
refinements O
of O
polished O
societies O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
, O
Sir O
; O
—and O
it O
has O
the O
advantage O
also O
of O
being O
in O
vogue O
amongst O
the O
less O
polished O
societies O
of O
the O
world—Every O
savage O
can O
dance O
. O
" O
Sir O
William O
only O
smiled O
. O
" O
Your O
friend O
performs O
delightfully O
; O
" O
he O
continued O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
on O
seeing O
Bingley O
join O
the O
group O
; O
— O
" O
and O
I O
doubt O
not O
that O
you O
are O
an O
adept O
in O
the O
science O
yourself O
, O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
. O
" O
" O
You O
saw O
me O
dance O
at O
Meryton O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
Sir O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
indeed O
, O
and O
received O
no O
inconsiderable O
pleasure O
from O
the O
sight O
. O
Do O
you O
often O
dance O
at O
St O
. O
James O
's O
? O
" O
" O
Never O
, O
Sir O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
not O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
proper O
compliment O
to O
the O
place O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
a O
compliment O
which O
I O
never O
pay O
to O
any O
place O
if O
I O
can O
avoid O
it O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
a O
house O
in O
town O
, O
I O
conclude O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
bowed O
. O
" O
I O
had O
once O
some O
thoughts O
of O
fixing O
in O
town O
myself—for O
I O
am O
fond O
of O
superior O
society O
; O
but O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
quite O
certain O
that O
the O
air O
of O
London O
would O
agree O
with O
Lady O
Lucas O
. O
" O
He O
paused O
in O
hopes O
of O
an O
answer O
; O
but O
his O
companion O
was O
not O
disposed O
to O
make O
any O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
at O
that O
instant O
moving O
towards O
them O
, O
he O
was O
struck O
with O
the O
notion O
of O
doing O
a O
very O
gallant O
thing O
, O
and O
called O
out O
to O
her O
, O
" O
My O
dear O
Miss O
Eliza O
, O
why O
are O
not O
you O
dancing O
? O
—Mr O
. O
Darcy O
, O
you O
must O
allow O
me O
to O
present O
this O
young O
lady O
to O
you O
as O
a O
very O
desirable O
partner.—You O
can O
not O
refuse O
to O
dance O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
when O
so O
much O
beauty O
is O
before O
you O
. O
" O
And O
taking O
her O
hand O
, O
he O
would O
have O
given O
it O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
who O
, O
though O
extremely O
surprized O
, O
was O
not O
unwilling O
to O
receive O
it O
, O
when O
she O
instantly O
drew O
back O
, O
and O
said O
with O
some O
discomposure O
to O
Sir O
William O
, O
" O
Indeed O
, O
Sir O
, O
I O
have O
not O
the O
least O
intention O
of O
dancing.—I O
entreat O
you O
not O
to O
suppose O
that O
I O
moved O
this O
way O
in O
order O
to O
beg O
for O
a O
partner O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
with O
grave O
propriety O
, O
requested O
to O
be O
allowed O
the O
honour O
of O
her O
hand O
; O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
determined O
; O
nor O
did O
Sir O
William O
at O
all O
shake O
her O
purpose O
by O
his O
attempt O
at O
persuasion O
. O
" O
You O
excel O
so O
much O
in O
the O
dance O
, O
Miss O
Eliza O
, O
that O
it O
is O
cruel O
to O
deny O
me O
the O
happiness O
of O
seeing O
you O
; O
and O
though O
this O
gentleman O
dislikes O
the O
amusement O
in O
general O
, O
he O
can O
have O
no O
objection O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
to O
oblige O
us O
for O
one O
half O
hour O
. O
" O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
all O
politeness O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
smiling O
. O
" O
He O
is O
indeed—but O
considering O
the O
inducement O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Eliza O
, O
we O
can O
not O
wonder O
at O
his O
complaisance O
; O
for O
who O
would O
object O
to O
such O
a O
partner O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
looked O
archly O
, O
and O
turned O
away O
. O
Her O
resistance O
had O
not O
injured O
her O
with O
the O
gentleman O
, O
and O
he O
was O
thinking O
of O
her O
with O
some O
complacency O
, O
when O
thus O
accosted O
by O
Miss O
Bingley O
. O
" O
I O
can O
guess O
the O
subject O
of O
your O
reverie O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
imagine O
not O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
considering O
how O
insupportable O
it O
would O
be O
to O
pass O
many O
evenings O
in O
this O
manner—in O
such O
society O
; O
and O
indeed O
I O
am O
quite O
of O
your O
opinion O
. O
I O
was O
never O
more O
annoyed O
! O
The O
insipidity O
and O
yet O
the O
noise O
; O
the O
nothingness O
and O
yet O
the O
self-importance O
of O
all O
these O
people O
! O
—What O
would O
I O
give O
to O
hear O
your O
strictures O
on O
them O
! O
" O
" O
Your O
conjecture O
is O
totally O
wrong O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
. O
My O
mind O
was O
more O
agreeably O
engaged O
. O
I O
have O
been O
meditating O
on O
the O
very O
great O
pleasure O
which O
a O
pair O
of O
fine O
eyes O
in O
the O
face O
of O
a O
pretty O
woman O
can O
bestow O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bingley O
immediately O
fixed O
her O
eyes O
on O
his O
face O
, O
and O
desired O
he O
would O
tell O
her O
what O
lady O
had O
the O
credit O
of O
inspiring O
such O
reflections O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
replied O
with O
great O
intrepidity O
, O
" O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
Bennet O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
Bennet O
! O
" O
repeated O
Miss O
Bingley O
. O
" O
I O
am O
all O
astonishment O
. O
How O
long O
has O
she O
been O
such O
a O
favourite O
? O
—and O
pray O
when O
am O
I O
to O
wish O
you O
joy O
? O
" O
" O
That O
is O
exactly O
the O
question O
which O
I O
expected O
you O
to O
ask O
. O
A O
lady O
's O
imagination O
is O
very O
rapid O
; O
it O
jumps O
from O
admiration O
to O
love O
, O
from O
love O
to O
matrimony O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
I O
knew O
you O
would O
be O
wishing O
me O
joy O
. O
" O
" O
Nay O
, O
if O
you O
are O
so O
serious O
about O
it O
, O
I O
shall O
consider O
the O
matter O
as O
absolutely O
settled.—You O
will O
have O
a O
charming O
mother-in-law O
, O
indeed O
, O
and O
of O
course O
she O
will O
be O
always O
at O
Pemberley O
with O
you O
. O
" O
He O
listened O
to O
her O
with O
perfect O
indifference O
, O
while O
she O
chose O
to O
entertain O
herself O
in O
this O
manner O
; O
and O
as O
his O
composure O
convinced O
her O
that O
all O
was O
safe O
, O
her O
wit O
flowed O
long O
. O
