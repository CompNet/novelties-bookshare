I O
have O
been O
thinking O
it O
over O
again O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
said O
her O
uncle O
, O
as O
they O
drove O
from O
the O
town O
; O
" O
and O
really O
, O
upon O
serious O
consideration O
, O
I O
am O
much O
more O
inclined O
than O
I O
was O
to O
judge O
as O
your O
eldest O
sister O
does O
of O
the O
matter O
. O
It O
appears O
to O
me O
so O
very O
unlikely O
, O
that O
any O
young O
man O
should O
form O
such O
a O
design O
against O
a O
girl O
who O
is O
by O
no O
means O
unprotected O
or O
friendless O
, O
and O
who O
was O
actually O
staying O
in O
his O
Colonel O
's O
family O
, O
that O
I O
am O
strongly O
inclined O
to O
hope O
the O
best O
. O
Could O
he O
expect O
that O
her O
friends O
would O
not O
step O
forward O
? O
Could O
he O
expect O
to O
be O
noticed O
again O
by O
the O
regiment O
, O
after O
such O
an O
affront O
to O
Colonel O
Forster O
? O
His O
temptation O
is O
not O
adequate O
to O
the O
risk O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
really O
think O
so O
? O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
brightening O
up O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
" O
I O
begin O
to O
be O
of O
your O
uncle O
's O
opinion O
. O
It O
is O
really O
too O
great O
a O
violation O
of O
decency O
, O
honour O
, O
and O
interest O
, O
for O
him O
to O
be O
guilty O
of O
it O
. O
I O
can O
not O
think O
so O
very O
ill O
of O
Wickham O
. O
Can O
you O
, O
yourself O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
so O
wholly O
give O
him O
up O
, O
as O
to O
believe O
him O
capable O
of O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
perhaps O
of O
neglecting O
his O
own O
interest O
. O
But O
of O
every O
other O
neglect O
I O
can O
believe O
him O
capable O
. O
If O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
should O
be O
so O
! O
But O
I O
dare O
not O
hope O
it O
. O
Why O
should O
they O
not O
go O
on O
to O
Scotland O
, O
if O
that O
had O
been O
the O
case O
? O
" O
" O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
" O
there O
is O
no O
absolute O
proof O
that O
they O
are O
not O
gone O
to O
Scotland O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
but O
their O
removing O
from O
the O
chaise O
into O
an O
hackney O
coach O
is O
such O
a O
presumption O
! O
And O
, O
besides O
, O
no O
traces O
of O
them O
were O
to O
be O
found O
on O
the O
Barnet O
road O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
then—supposing O
them O
to O
be O
in O
London O
. O
They O
may O
be O
there O
, O
though O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
concealment O
, O
for O
no O
more O
exceptionable O
purpose O
. O
It O
is O
not O
likely O
that O
money O
should O
be O
very O
abundant O
on O
either O
side O
; O
and O
it O
might O
strike O
them O
that O
they O
could O
be O
more O
economically O
, O
though O
less O
expeditiously O
, O
married O
in O
London O
, O
than O
in O
Scotland O
. O
" O
" O
But O
why O
all O
this O
secrecy O
? O
Why O
any O
fear O
of O
detection O
? O
Why O
must O
their O
marriage O
be O
private O
? O
Oh O
! O
no O
, O
no O
, O
this O
is O
not O
likely O
. O
His O
most O
particular O
friend O
, O
you O
see O
by O
Jane O
's O
account O
, O
was O
persuaded O
of O
his O
never O
intending O
to O
marry O
her O
. O
Wickham O
will O
never O
marry O
a O
woman O
without O
some O
money O
. O
He O
can O
not O
afford O
it O
. O
And O
what O
claims O
has O
Lydia O
, O
what O
attractions O
has O
she O
beyond O
youth O
, O
health O
, O
and O
good O
humour O
, O
that O
could O
make O
him O
for O
her O
sake O
forego O
every O
chance O
of O
benefiting O
himself O
by O
marrying O
well O
? O
As O
to O
what O
restraint O
the O
apprehensions O
of O
disgrace O
in O
the O
corps O
might O
throw O
on O
a O
dishonourable O
elopement O
with O
her O
, O
I O
am O
not O
able O
to O
judge O
; O
for O
I O
know O
nothing O
of O
the O
effects O
that O
such O
a O
step O
might O
produce O
. O
But O
as O
to O
your O
other O
objection O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
it O
will O
hardly O
hold O
good O
. O
Lydia O
has O
no O
brothers O
to O
step O
forward O
; O
and O
he O
might O
imagine O
, O
from O
my O
father O
's O
behaviour O
, O
from O
his O
indolence O
and O
the O
little O
attention O
he O
has O
ever O
seemed O
to O
give O
to O
what O
was O
going O
forward O
in O
his O
family O
, O
that O
he O
would O
do O
as O
little O
, O
and O
think O
as O
little O
about O
it O
, O
as O
any O
father O
could O
do O
, O
in O
such O
a O
matter O
. O
" O
" O
But O
can O
you O
think O
that O
Lydia O
is O
so O
lost O
to O
every O
thing O
but O
love O
of O
him O
, O
as O
to O
consent O
to O
live O
with O
him O
on O
any O
other O
terms O
than O
marriage O
? O
" O
" O
It O
does O
seem O
, O
and O
it O
is O
most O
shocking O
indeed O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
with O
tears O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
" O
that O
a O
sister O
's O
sense O
of O
decency O
and O
virtue O
in O
such O
a O
point O
should O
admit O
of O
doubt O
. O
But O
, O
really O
, O
I O
know O
not O
what O
to O
say O
. O
Perhaps O
I O
am O
not O
doing O
her O
justice O
. O
But O
she O
is O
very O
young O
; O
she O
has O
never O
been O
taught O
to O
think O
on O
serious O
subjects O
; O
and O
for O
the O
last O
half O
year O
, O
nay O
, O
for O
a O
twelvemonth O
, O
she O
has O
been O
given O
up O
to O
nothing O
but O
amusement O
and O
vanity O
. O
She O
has O
been O
allowed O
to O
dispose O
of O
her O
time O
in O
the O
most O
idle O
and O
frivolous O
manner O
, O
and O
to O
adopt O
any O
opinions O
that O
came O
in O
her O
way O
. O
Since O
the O
————shire O
were O
first O
quartered O
in O
Meryton O
, O
nothing O
but O
love O
, O
flirtation O
, O
and O
officers O
, O
have O
been O
in O
her O
head O
. O
She O
has O
been O
doing O
every O
thing O
in O
her O
power O
by O
thinking O
and O
talking O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
to O
give O
greater—what O
shall O
I O
call O
it O
? O
susceptibility O
to O
her O
feelings O
; O
which O
are O
naturally O
lively O
enough O
. O
And O
we O
all O
know O
that O
Wickham O
has O
every O
charm O
of O
person O
and O
address O
that O
can O
captivate O
a O
woman O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
see O
that O
Jane O
, O
" O
said O
her O
aunt O
, O
" O
does O
not O
think O
so O
ill O
of O
Wickham O
, O
as O
to O
believe O
him O
capable O
of O
the O
attempt O
. O
" O
" O
Of O
whom O
does O
Jane O
ever O
think O
ill O
? O
And O
who O
is O
there O
, O
whatever O
might O
be O
their O
former O
conduct O
, O
that O
she O
would O
believe O
capable O
of O
such O
an O
attempt O
, O
till O
it O
were O
proved O
against O
them O
? O
But O
Jane O
knows O
, O
as O
well O
as O
I O
do O
, O
what O
Wickham O
really O
is O
. O
We O
both O
know O
that O
he O
has O
been O
profligate O
in O
every O
sense O
of O
the O
word O
. O
That O
he O
has O
neither O
integrity O
nor O
honour O
. O
That O
he O
is O
as O
false O
and O
deceitful O
as O
he O
is O
insinuating O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
really O
know O
all O
this O
? O
" O
cried O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
whose O
curiosity O
as O
to O
the O
mode O
of O
her O
intelligence O
was O
all O
alive O
. O
" O
I O
do O
, O
indeed O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
colouring O
. O
" O
I O
told O
you O
the O
other O
day O
, O
of O
his O
infamous O
behaviour O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
; O
and O
you O
, O
yourself O
, O
when O
last O
at O
Longbourn O
, O
heard O
in O
what O
manner O
he O
spoke O
of O
the O
man O
who O
had O
behaved O
with O
such O
forbearance O
and O
liberality O
towards O
him O
. O
And O
there O
are O
other O
circumstances O
which O
I O
am O
not O
at O
liberty———which O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
while O
to O
relate O
; O
but O
his O
lies O
about O
the O
whole O
Pemberley O
family O
are O
endless O
. O
From O
what O
he O
said O
of O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
I O
was O
thoroughly O
prepared O
to O
see O
a O
proud O
, O
reserved O
, O
disagreeable O
girl O
. O
Yet O
he O
knew O
to O
the O
contrary O
himself O
. O
He O
must O
know O
that O
she O
was O
as O
amiable O
and O
unpretending O
as O
we O
have O
found O
her O
. O
" O
" O
But O
does O
Lydia O
know O
nothing O
of O
this O
; O
can O
she O
be O
ignorant O
of O
what O
you O
and O
Jane O
seem O
so O
well O
to O
understand O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
yes O
! O
—that O
, O
that O
is O
the O
worst O
of O
all O
. O
Till O
I O
was O
in O
Kent O
, O
and O
saw O
so O
much O
both O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
and O
his O
relation O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
I O
was O
ignorant O
of O
the O
truth O
myself O
. O
And O
when O
I O
returned O
home O
the O
———shire O
was O
to O
leave O
Meryton O
in O
a O
week O
or O
fortnight O
's O
time O
. O
As O
that O
was O
the O
case O
, O
neither O
Jane O
, O
to O
whom O
I O
related O
the O
whole O
, O
nor O
I O
, O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
make O
our O
knowledge O
public O
; O
for O
of O
what O
use O
could O
it O
apparently O
be O
to O
any O
one O
, O
that O
the O
good O
opinion O
, O
which O
all O
the O
neighbourhood O
had O
of O
him O
, O
should O
then O
be O
overthrown O
? O
And O
even O
when O
it O
was O
settled O
that O
Lydia O
should O
go O
with O
Mrs. O
Forster O
, O
the O
necessity O
of O
opening O
her O
eyes O
to O
his O
character O
never O
occurred O
to O
me O
. O
That O
she O
could O
be O
in O
any O
danger O
from O
the O
deception O
never O
entered O
my O
head O
. O
That O
such O
a O
consequence O
as O
this O
should O
ensue O
, O
you O
may O
easily O
believe O
was O
far O
enough O
from O
my O
thoughts O
. O
" O
" O
When O
they O
all O
removed O
to O
Brighton O
, O
therefore O
, O
you O
had O
no O
reason O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
believe O
them O
fond O
of O
each O
other O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
the O
slightest O
. O
I O
can O
remember O
no O
symptom O
of O
affection O
on O
either O
side O
; O
and O
had O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
kind O
been O
perceptible O
, O
you O
must O
be O
aware O
that O
our O
's O
is O
not O
a O
family O
, O
on O
which O
it O
could O
be O
thrown O
away O
. O
When O
first O
he O
entered O
the O
corps O
, O
she O
was O
ready O
enough O
to O
admire O
him O
; O
but O
so O
we O
all O
were O
. O
Every O
girl O
in O
, O
or O
near O
Meryton O
, O
was O
out O
of O
her O
senses O
about O
him O
for O
the O
first O
two O
months O
; O
but O
he O
never O
distinguished O
her O
by O
any O
particular O
attention O
; O
and O
, O
consequently O
, O
after O
a O
moderate O
period O
of O
extravagant O
and O
wild O
admiration O
, O
her O
fancy O
for O
him O
gave O
way O
, O
and O
others O
of O
the O
regiment O
, O
who O
treated O
her O
with O
more O
distinction O
, O
again O
became O
her O
favourites O
. O
" O
* O
* O
* O
It O
may O
be O
easily O
believed O
, O
that O
however O
little O
of O
novelty O
could O
be O
added O
to O
their O
fears O
, O
hopes O
, O
and O
conjectures O
, O
on O
this O
interesting O
subject O
, O
by O
its O
repeated O
discussion O
, O
no O
other O
could O
detain O
them O
from O
it O
long O
, O
during O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
journey O
. O
From O
Elizabeth O
's O
thoughts O
it O
was O
never O
absent O
. O
Fixed O
there O
by O
the O
keenest O
of O
all O
anguish O
, O
self-reproach O
, O
she O
could O
find O
no O
interval O
of O
ease O
or O
forgetfulness O
. O
They O
travelled O
as O
expeditiously O
as O
possible O
; O
and O
sleeping O
one O
night O
on O
the O
road O
, O
reached O
Longbourn O
by O
dinner-time O
the O
next O
day O
. O
It O
was O
a O
comfort O
to O
Elizabeth O
to O
consider O
that O
Jane O
could O
not O
have O
been O
wearied O
by O
long O
expectations O
. O
The O
little O
Gardiners O
, O
attracted O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
chaise O
, O
were O
standing O
on O
the O
steps O
of O
the O
house O
, O
as O
they O
entered O
the O
paddock O
; O
and O
when O
the O
carriage O
drove O
up O
to O
the O
door O
, O
the O
joyful O
surprize O
that O
lighted O
up O
their O
faces O
and O
displayed O
itself O
over O
their O
whole O
bodies O
, O
in O
a O
variety O
of O
capers O
and O
frisks O
, O
was O
the O
first O
pleasing O
earnest O
of O
their O
welcome O
. O
Elizabeth O
jumped O
out O
; O
and O
after O
giving O
each O
of O
them O
an O
hasty O
kiss O
, O
hurried O
into O
the O
vestibule O
, O
where O
Jane O
, O
who O
came O
running O
down O
stairs O
from O
her O
mother O
's O
apartment O
, O
immediately O
met O
her O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
as O
she O
affectionately O
embraced O
her O
, O
whilst O
tears O
filled O
the O
eyes O
of O
both O
, O
lost O
not O
a O
moment O
in O
asking O
whether O
any O
thing O
had O
been O
heard O
of O
the O
fugitives O
. O
" O
Not O
yet O
, O
" O
replied O
Jame O
. O
" O
But O
now O
that O
my O
dear O
uncle O
is O
come O
, O
I O
hope O
every O
thing O
will O
be O
well O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
my O
father O
in O
town O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
he O
went O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
as O
I O
wrote O
you O
word O
. O
" O
" O
And O
have O
you O
heard O
from O
him O
often O
? O
" O
" O
We O
have O
heard O
only O
once O
. O
He O
wrote O
me O
a O
few O
lines O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
to O
say O
that O
he O
had O
arrived O
in O
safety O
, O
and O
to O
give O
me O
his O
directions O
, O
which O
I O
particularly O
begged O
him O
to O
do O
. O
He O
merely O
added O
, O
that O
he O
should O
not O
write O
again O
, O
till O
he O
had O
something O
of O
importance O
to O
mention O
. O
" O
" O
And O
my O
mother—How O
is O
she O
? O
How O
are O
you O
all O
? O
" O
" O
My O
mother O
is O
tolerably O
well O
, O
I O
trust O
; O
though O
her O
spirits O
are O
greatly O
shaken O
. O
She O
is O
up O
stairs O
, O
and O
will O
have O
great O
satisfaction O
in O
seeing O
you O
all O
. O
She O
does O
not O
yet O
leave O
her O
dressing-room O
. O
Mary O
and O
Kitty O
, O
thank O
Heaven O
! O
are O
quite O
well O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you—How O
are O
you O
? O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
You O
look O
pale O
. O
How O
much O
you O
must O
have O
gone O
through O
! O
" O
Her O
sister O
, O
however O
, O
assured O
her O
of O
her O
being O
perfectly O
well O
; O
and O
their O
conversation O
, O
which O
had O
been O
passing O
while O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
were O
engaged O
with O
their O
children O
, O
was O
now O
put O
an O
end O
to O
, O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
. O
Jane O
ran O
to O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
and O
welcomed O
and O
thanked O
them O
both O
, O
with O
alternate O
smiles O
and O
tears O
. O
When O
they O
were O
all O
in O
the O
drawing O
room O
, O
the O
questions O
which O
Elizabeth O
had O
already O
asked O
, O
were O
of O
course O
repeated O
by O
the O
others O
, O
and O
they O
soon O
found O
that O
Jane O
had O
no O
intelligence O
to O
give O
. O
The O
sanguine O
hope O
of O
good O
, O
however O
, O
which O
the O
benevolence O
of O
her O
heart O
suggested O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
deserted O
her O
; O
she O
still O
expected O
that O
it O
would O
all O
end O
well O
, O
and O
that O
every O
morning O
would O
bring O
some O
letter O
, O
either O
from O
Lydia O
or O
her O
father O
, O
to O
explain O
their O
proceedings O
, O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
announce O
the O
marriage O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
to O
whose O
apartment O
they O
all O
repaired O
, O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
conversation O
together O
, O
received O
them O
exactly O
as O
might O
be O
expected O
; O
with O
tears O
and O
lamentations O
of O
regret O
, O
invectives O
against O
the O
villanous O
conduct O
of O
Wickham O
, O
and O
complaints O
of O
her O
own O
sufferings O
and O
ill O
usage O
. O
Blaming O
every O
body O
but O
the O
person O
to O
whose O
ill-judging O
indulgence O
the O
errors O
of O
her O
daughter O
must O
be O
principally O
owing O
. O
" O
If O
I O
had O
been O
able O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
to O
carry O
my O
point O
in O
going O
to O
Brighton O
with O
all O
my O
family O
, O
this O
would O
not O
have O
happened O
; O
but O
poor O
dear O
Lydia O
had O
nobody O
to O
take O
care O
of O
her O
. O
Why O
did O
the O
Forsters O
ever O
let O
her O
go O
out O
of O
their O
sight O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
there O
was O
some O
great O
neglect O
or O
other O
on O
their O
side O
, O
for O
she O
is O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
girl O
to O
do O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
if O
she O
had O
been O
well O
looked O
after O
. O
I O
always O
thought O
they O
were O
very O
unfit O
to O
have O
the O
charge O
of O
her O
; O
but O
I O
was O
overruled O
, O
as O
I O
always O
am O
. O
Poor O
, O
dear O
child O
! O
And O
now O
here O
's O
Mr. O
Bennet O
gone O
away O
, O
and O
I O
know O
he O
will O
fight O
Wickham O
, O
wherever O
he O
meets O
him O
, O
and O
then O
he O
will O
be O
killed O
, O
and O
what O
is O
to O
become O
of O
us O
all O
? O
The O
Collinses O
will O
turn O
us O
out O
, O
before O
he O
is O
cold O
in O
his O
grave O
; O
and O
if O
you O
are O
not O
kind O
to O
us O
, O
brother O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
we O
shall O
do O
. O
" O
They O
all O
exclaimed O
against O
such O
terrific O
ideas O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
after O
general O
assurances O
of O
his O
affection O
for O
her O
and O
all O
her O
family O
, O
told O
her O
that O
he O
meant O
to O
be O
in O
London O
the O
very O
next O
day O
, O
and O
would O
assist O
Mr. O
Bennet O
in O
every O
endeavour O
for O
recovering O
Lydia O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
give O
way O
to O
useless O
alarm O
, O
" O
added O
he O
; O
" O
though O
it O
is O
right O
to O
be O
prepared O
for O
the O
worst O
, O
there O
is O
no O
occasion O
to O
look O
on O
it O
as O
certain O
. O
It O
is O
not O
quite O
a O
week O
since O
they O
left O
Brighton O
. O
In O
a O
few O
days O
more O
, O
we O
may O
gain O
some O
news O
of O
them O
, O
and O
till O
we O
know O
that O
they O
are O
not O
married O
, O
and O
have O
no O
design O
of O
marrying O
, O
do O
not O
let O
us O
give O
the O
matter O
over O
as O
lost O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
to O
town O
, O
I O
shall O
go O
to O
my O
brother O
, O
and O
make O
him O
come O
home O
with O
me O
to O
Gracechurch-street O
, O
and O
then O
we O
may O
consult O
together O
as O
to O
what O
is O
to O
be O
done O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
brother O
, O
" O
replied O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
could O
most O
wish O
for O
. O
And O
now O
do O
, O
when O
you O
get O
to O
town O
, O
find O
them O
out O
, O
wherever O
they O
may O
be O
; O
and O
if O
they O
are O
not O
married O
already O
, O
make O
them O
marry O
. O
And O
as O
for O
wedding O
clothes O
, O
do O
not O
let O
them O
wait O
for O
that O
, O
but O
tell O
Lydia O
she O
shall O
have O
as O
much O
money O
as O
she O
chuses O
to O
buy O
them O
, O
after O
they O
are O
married O
. O
And O
, O
above O
all O
things O
, O
keep O
Mr. O
Bennet O
from O
fighting O
. O
Tell O
him O
what O
a O
dreadful O
state O
I O
am O
in—that O
I O
am O
frighted O
out O
of O
my O
wits O
; O
and O
have O
such O
tremblings O
, O
such O
flutterings O
, O
all O
over O
me O
, O
such O
spasms O
in O
my O
side O
, O
and O
pains O
in O
my O
head O
, O
and O
such O
beatings O
at O
heart O
, O
that O
I O
can O
get O
no O
rest O
by O
night O
nor O
by O
day O
. O
And O
tell O
my O
dear O
Lydia O
, O
not O
to O
give O
any O
directions O
about O
her O
clothes O
, O
till O
she O
has O
seen O
me O
, O
for O
she O
does O
not O
know O
which O
are O
the O
best O
warehouses O
. O
Oh O
! O
brother O
, O
how O
kind O
you O
are O
! O
I O
know O
you O
will O
contrive O
it O
all O
. O
" O
But O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
though O
he O
assured O
her O
again O
of O
his O
earnest O
endeavours O
in O
the O
cause O
, O
could O
not O
avoid O
recommending O
moderation O
to O
her O
, O
as O
well O
in O
her O
hopes O
as O
her O
fears O
; O
and O
after O
talking O
with O
her O
in O
this O
manner O
till O
dinner O
was O
on O
table O
, O
they O
left O
her O
to O
vent O
all O
her O
feelings O
on O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
who O
attended O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
her O
daughters O
. O
Though O
her O
brother O
and O
sister O
were O
persuaded O
that O
there O
was O
no O
real O
occasion O
for O
such O
a O
seclusion O
from O
the O
family O
, O
they O
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
oppose O
it O
, O
for O
they O
knew O
that O
she O
had O
not O
prudence O
enough O
to O
hold O
her O
tongue O
before O
the O
servants O
, O
while O
they O
waited O
at O
table O
, O
and O
judged O
it O
better O
that O
one O
only O
of O
the O
household O
, O
and O
the O
one O
whom O
they O
could O
most O
trust O
, O
should O
comprehend O
all O
her O
fears O
and O
solicitude O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
In O
the O
dining-room O
they O
were O
soon O
joined O
by O
Mary O
and O
Kitty O
, O
who O
had O
been O
too O
busily O
engaged O
in O
their O
separate O
apartments O
, O
to O
make O
their O
appearance O
before O
. O
One O
came O
from O
her O
books O
, O
and O
the O
other O
from O
her O
toilette O
. O
The O
faces O
of O
both O
, O
however O
, O
were O
tolerably O
calm O
; O
and O
no O
change O
was O
visible O
in O
either O
, O
except O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
her O
favourite O
sister O
, O
or O
the O
anger O
which O
she O
had O
herself O
incurred O
in O
the O
business O
, O
had O
given O
something O
more O
of O
fretfulness O
than O
usual O
to O
the O
accents O
of O
Kitty O
. O
As O
for O
Mary O
, O
she O
was O
mistress O
enough O
of O
herself O
to O
whisper O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
with O
a O
countenance O
of O
grave O
reflection O
, O
soon O
after O
they O
were O
seated O
at O
table— O
" O
This O
is O
a O
most O
unfortunate O
affair O
; O
and O
will O
probably O
be O
much O
talked O
of O
. O
But O
we O
must O
stem O
the O
tide O
of O
malice O
, O
and O
pour O
into O
the O
wounded O
bosoms O
of O
each O
other O
the O
balm O
of O
sisterly O
consolation O
. O
" O
Then O
, O
perceiving O
in O
Elizabeth O
no O
inclination O
of O
replying O
, O
she O
added O
, O
" O
Unhappy O
as O
the O
event O
must O
be O
for O
Lydia O
, O
we O
may O
draw O
from O
it O
this O
useful O
lesson O
: O
that O
loss O
of O
virtue O
in O
a O
female O
is O
irretrievable—that O
one O
false O
step O
involves O
her O
in O
endless O
ruin—that O
her O
reputation O
is O
no O
less O
brittle O
than O
it O
is O
beautiful O
, O
—and O
that O
she O
can O
not O
be O
too O
much O
guarded O
in O
her O
behaviour O
towards O
the O
undeserving O
of O
the O
other O
sex O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
lifted O
up O
her O
eyes O
in O
amazement O
, O
but O
was O
too O
much O
oppressed O
to O
make O
any O
reply O
. O
Mary O
, O
however O
, O
continued O
to O
console O
herself O
with O
such O
kind O
of O
moral O
extractions O
from O
the O
evil O
before O
them O
. O
In O
the O
afternoon O
, O
the O
two O
elder O
Miss O
Bennets O
were O
able O
to O
be O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
by O
themselves O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
instantly O
availed O
herself O
of O
the O
opportunity O
of O
making O
any O
inquiries O
, O
which O
Jane O
was O
equally O
eager O
to O
satisfy O
. O
After O
joining O
in O
general O
lamentations O
over O
the O
dreadful O
sequel O
of O
this O
event O
, O
which O
Elizabeth O
considered O
as O
all O
but O
certain O
, O
and O
Miss O
Bennet O
could O
not O
assert O
to O
be O
wholly O
impossible O
; O
the O
former O
continued O
the O
subject O
, O
by O
saying O
, O
" O
But O
tell O
me O
all O
and O
every O
thing O
about O
it O
, O
which O
I O
have O
not O
already O
heard O
. O
Give O
me O
further O
particulars O
. O
What O
did O
Colonel O
Forster O
say O
? O
Had O
they O
no O
apprehension O
of O
any O
thing O
before O
the O
elopement O
took O
place O
? O
They O
must O
have O
seen O
them O
together O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
" O
Colonel O
Forster O
did O
own O
that O
he O
had O
often O
suspected O
some O
partiality O
, O
especially O
on O
Lydia O
's O
side O
, O
but O
nothing O
to O
give O
him O
any O
alarm O
. O
I O
am O
so O
grieved O
for O
him O
. O
His O
behaviour O
was O
attentive O
and O
kind O
to O
the O
utmost O
. O
He O
was O
coming O
to O
us O
, O
in O
order O
to O
assure O
us O
of O
his O
concern O
, O
before O
he O
had O
any O
idea O
of O
their O
not O
being O
gone O
to O
Scotland O
: O
when O
that O
apprehension O
first O
got O
abroad O
, O
it O
hastened O
his O
journey O
. O
" O
" O
And O
was O
Denny O
convinced O
that O
Wickham O
would O
not O
marry O
? O
Did O
he O
know O
of O
their O
intending O
to O
go O
off O
? O
Had O
Colonel O
Forster O
seen O
Denny O
himself O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
but O
when O
questioned O
by O
him O
Denny O
denied O
knowing O
any O
thing O
of O
their O
plan O
, O
and O
would O
not O
give O
his O
real O
opinion O
about O
it O
. O
He O
did O
not O
repeat O
his O
persuasion O
of O
their O
not O
marrying—and O
from O
that O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
hope O
, O
he O
might O
have O
been O
misunderstood O
before O
. O
" O
" O
And O
till O
Colonel O
Forster O
came O
himself O
, O
not O
one O
of O
you O
entertained O
a O
doubt O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
of O
their O
being O
really O
married O
? O
" O
" O
How O
was O
it O
possible O
that O
such O
an O
idea O
should O
enter O
our O
brains O
! O
I O
felt O
a O
little O
uneasy—a O
little O
fearful O
of O
my O
sister O
's O
happiness O
with O
him O
in O
marriage O
, O
because O
I O
knew O
that O
his O
conduct O
had O
not O
been O
always O
quite O
right O
. O
My O
father O
and O
mother O
knew O
nothing O
of O
that O
, O
they O
only O
felt O
how O
imprudent O
a O
match O
it O
must O
be O
. O
Kitty O
then O
owned O
, O
with O
a O
very O
natural O
triumph O
on O
knowing O
more O
than O
the O
rest O
of O
us O
, O
that O
in O
Lydia O
's O
last O
letter O
, O
she O
had O
prepared O
her O
for O
such O
a O
step O
. O
She O
had O
known O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
of O
their O
being O
in O
love O
with O
each O
other O
, O
many O
weeks O
. O
" O
" O
But O
not O
before O
they O
went O
to O
Brighton O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
I O
believe O
not O
. O
" O
" O
And O
did O
Colonel O
Forster O
appear O
to O
think O
ill O
of O
Wickham O
himself O
? O
Does O
he O
know O
his O
real O
character O
? O
" O
" O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
he O
did O
not O
speak O
so O
well O
of O
Wickham O
as O
he O
formerly O
did O
. O
He O
believed O
him O
to O
be O
imprudent O
and O
extravagant O
. O
And O
since O
this O
sad O
affair O
has O
taken O
place O
, O
it O
is O
said O
that O
he O
left O
Meryton O
greatly O
in O
debt O
; O
but O
I O
hope O
this O
may O
be O
false O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
Jane O
, O
had O
we O
been O
less O
secret O
, O
had O
we O
told O
what O
we O
knew O
of O
him O
, O
this O
could O
not O
have O
happened O
! O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
it O
would O
have O
been O
better O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
sister O
. O
" O
But O
to O
expose O
the O
former O
faults O
of O
any O
person O
, O
without O
knowing O
what O
their O
present O
feelings O
were O
, O
seemed O
unjustifiable O
. O
We O
acted O
with O
the O
best O
intentions O
. O
" O
" O
Could O
Colonel O
Forster O
repeat O
the O
particulars O
of O
Lydia O
's O
note O
to O
his O
wife O
? O
" O
" O
He O
brought O
it O
with O
him O
for O
us O
to O
see O
. O
" O
Jane O
then O
took O
it O
from O
her O
pocket-book O
, O
and O
gave O
it O
to O
Elizabeth O
. O
These O
were O
the O
contents O
: O
" O
My O
dear O
Harriet O
, O
" O
You O
will O
laugh O
when O
you O
know O
where O
I O
am O
gone O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
help O
laughing O
myself O
at O
your O
surprize O
to-morrow O
morning O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
am O
missed O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
Gretna O
Green O
, O
and O
if O
you O
can O
not O
guess O
with O
who O
, O
I O
shall O
think O
you O
a O
simpleton O
, O
for O
there O
is O
but O
one O
man O
in O
the O
world O
I O
love O
, O
and O
he O
is O
an O
angel O
. O
I O
should O
never O
be O
happy O
without O
him O
, O
so O
think O
it O
no O
harm O
to O
be O
off O
. O
You O
need O
not O
send O
them O
word O
at O
Longbourn O
of O
my O
going O
, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
like O
it O
, O
for O
it O
will O
make O
the O
surprize O
the O
greater O
, O
when O
I O
write O
to O
them O
, O
and O
sign O
my O
name O
Lydia O
Wickham O
. O
What O
a O
good O
joke O
it O
will O
be O
! O
I O
can O
hardly O
write O
for O
laughing O
. O
Pray O
make O
my O
excuses O
to O
Pratt O
, O
for O
not O
keeping O
my O
engagement O

and O
dancing O

to O
night O

Tell O
him O

hope O

will O
excuse O

knows O
all O

and O
tell O

will O
dance O
with O
him O
at O
the O
next O
ball O

with O
great O
pleasure O

I O
shall O
send O
for O
my O
clothes O
when O
I O
get O
to O
Longbourn O
; O
but O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
tell O
Sally O
to O
mend O
a O
great O
slit O
in O
my O
worked O
muslin O
gown O
, O
before O
they O
are O
packed O
up O
. O
Good O
by O

Give O

Colonel O

Your O
affectionate O
friend O

Lydia O
Bennet O

" O
" O
Oh O
! O
thoughtless O
, O
thoughtless O
Lydia O
! O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
when O
she O
had O
finished O
it O
. O
" O
What O
a O
letter O
is O
this O
, O
to O
be O
written O
at O
such O
a O
moment O
! O
But O
at O
least O
it O
shews O
, O
that O
she O
was O
serious O
in O
the O
object O
of O
her O
journey O
. O
Whatever O
he O
might O
afterwards O
persuade O
her O
to O
, O
it O
was O
not O
on O
her O
side O
a O
scheme O
of O
infamy O
. O
My O
poor O
father O
! O
how O
he O
must O
have O
felt O
it O
! O
" O
" O
I O
never O
saw O
any O
one O
so O
shocked O
. O
He O
could O
not O
speak O
a O
word O
for O
full O
ten O
minutes O
. O
My O
mother O
was O
taken O
ill O
immediately O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
house O
in O
such O
confusion O
! O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
Jane O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
was O
there O
a O
servant O
belonging O
to O
it O
, O
who O
did O
not O
know O
the O
whole O
story O
before O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know.—I O
hope O
there O
was.—But O
to O
be O
guarded O
at O
such O
a O
time O
, O
is O
very O
difficult O
. O
My O
mother O
was O
in O
hysterics O
, O
and O
though O
I O
endeavoured O
to O
give O
her O
every O
assistance O
in O
my O
power O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
did O
not O
do O
so O
much O
as O
I O
might O
have O
done O
! O
but O
the O
horror O
of O
what O
might O
possibly O
happen O
, O
almost O
took O
from O
me O
my O
faculties O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
attendance O
upon O
her O
has O
been O
too O
much O
for O
you O
. O
You O
do O
not O
look O
well O
. O
Oh O
! O
that O
I O
had O
been O
with O
you O
! O
you O
have O
had O
every O
care O
and O
anxiety O
upon O
yourself O
alone O
. O
" O
" O
Mary O
and O
Kitty O
have O
been O
very O
kind O
, O
and O
would O
have O
shared O
in O
every O
fatigue O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
think O
it O
right O
for O
either O
of O
them O
. O
Kitty O
is O
slight O
and O
delicate O
, O
and O
Mary O
studies O
so O
much O
that O
her O
hours O
of O
repose O
should O
not O
be O
broken O
in O
on O
. O
My O
aunt O
Philips O
came O
to O
Longbourn O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
after O
my O
father O
went O
away O
; O
and O
was O
so O
good O
as O
to O
stay O
till O
Thursday O
with O
me O
. O
She O
was O
of O
great O
use O
and O
comfort O
to O
us O
all O
, O
and O
Lady O
Lucas O
has O
been O
very O
kind O
; O
she O
walked O
here O
on O
Wednesday O
morning O
to O
condole O
with O
us O
, O
and O
offered O
her O
services O
, O
or O
any O
of O
her O
daughters O
, O
if O
they O
could O
be O
of O
use O
to O
us O
. O
" O
" O
She O
had O
better O
have O
stayed O
at O
home O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
perhaps O
she O
meant O
well O
, O
but O
, O
under O
such O
a O
misfortune O
as O
this O
, O
one O
can O
not O
see O
too O
little O
of O
one O
's O
neighbours O
. O
Assistance O
is O
impossible O
; O
condolence O
, O
insufferable O
. O
Let O
them O
triumph O
over O
us O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
and O
be O
satisfied O
. O
" O
She O
then O
proceeded O
to O
inquire O
into O
the O
measures O
which O
her O
father O
had O
intended O
to O
pursue O
, O
while O
in O
town O
, O
for O
the O
recovery O
of O
his O
daughter O
. O
" O
He O
meant O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
" O
replied O
Jane O
, O
" O
to O
go O
to O
Epsom O
, O
the O
place O
were O
they O
last O
changed O
horses O
, O
see O
the O
postilions O
, O
and O
try O
if O
any O
thing O
could O
be O
made O
out O
from O
them O
. O
His O
principal O
object O
must O
be O
to O
discover O
the O
number O
of O
the O
hackney O
coach O
which O
took O
them O
from O
Clapham O
. O
It O
had O
come O
with O
a O
fare O
from O
London O
; O
and O
as O
he O
thought O
the O
circumstance O
of O
a O
gentleman O
and O
lady O
's O
removing O
from O
one O
carriage O
into O
another O
, O
might O
be O
remarked O
, O
he O
meant O
to O
make O
inquiries O
at O
Clapham O
. O
If O
he O
could O
any O
how O
discover O
at O
what O
house O
the O
coachman O
had O
before O
set O
down O
his O
fare O
, O
he O
determined O
to O
make O
inquiries O
there O
, O
and O
hoped O
it O
might O
not O
be O
impossible O
to O
find O
out O
the O
stand O
and O
number O
of O
the O
coach O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
of O
any O
other O
designs O
that O
he O
had O
formed O
: O
but O
he O
was O
in O
such O
a O
hurry O
to O
be O
gone O
, O
and O
his O
spirits O
so O
greatly O
discomposed O
, O
that O
I O
had O
difficulty O
in O
finding O
out O
even O
so O
much O
as O
this O
. O
