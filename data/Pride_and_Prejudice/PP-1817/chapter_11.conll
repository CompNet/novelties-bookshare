When O
the O
ladies O
removed O
after O
dinner O
, O
Elizabeth O
ran O
up O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
seeing O
her O
well O
guarded O
from O
cold O
, O
attended O
her O
into O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
where O
she O
was O
welcomed O
by O
her O
two O
friends O
with O
many O
professions O
of O
pleasure O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
had O
never O
seen O
them O
so O
agreeable O
as O
they O
were O
during O
the O
hour O
which O
passed O
before O
the O
gentlemen O
appeared O
. O
Their O
powers O
of O
conversation O
were O
considerable O
. O
They O
could O
describe O
an O
entertainment O
with O
accuracy O
, O
relate O
an O
anecdote O
with O
humour O
, O
and O
laugh O
at O
their O
acquaintance O
with O
spirit O
. O
But O
when O
the O
gentlemen O
entered O
, O
Jane O
was O
no O
longer O
the O
first O
object O
; O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
eyes O
were O
instantly O
turned O
towards O
Darcy O
, O
and O
she O
had O
something O
to O
say O
to O
him O
before O
he O
had O
advanced O
many O
steps O
. O
He O
addressed O
himself O
directly O
to O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
with O
a O
polite O
congratulation O
; O
Mr. O
Hurst O
also O
made O
her O
a O
slight O
bow O
, O
and O
said O
he O
was O
" O
very O
glad O
; O
" O
but O
diffuseness O
and O
warmth O
remained O
for O
Bingley O
's O
salutation O
. O
He O
was O
full O
of O
joy O
and O
attention O
. O
The O
first O
half O
hour O
was O
spent O
in O
piling O
up O
the O
fire O
, O
lest O
she O
should O
suffer O
from O
the O
change O
of O
room O
; O
and O
she O
removed O
at O
his O
desire O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
fire-place O
, O
that O
she O
might O
be O
farther O
from O
the O
door O
. O
He O
then O
sat O
down O
by O
her O
, O
and O
talked O
scarcely O
to O
any O
one O
else O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
at O
work O
in O
the O
opposite O
corner O
, O
saw O
it O
all O
with O
great O
delight O
. O
When O
tea O
was O
over O
, O
Mr. O
Hurst O
reminded O
his O
sister-in-law O
of O
the O
card-table—but O
in O
vain O
. O
She O
had O
obtained O
private O
intelligence O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
did O
not O
wish O
for O
cards O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Hurst O
soon O
found O
even O
his O
open O
petition O
rejected O
. O
She O
assured O
him O
that O
no O
one O
intended O
to O
play O
, O
and O
the O
silence O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
seemed O
to O
justify O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Hurst O
had O
therefore O
nothing O
to O
do O
, O
but O
to O
stretch O
himself O
on O
one O
of O
the O
sophas O
and O
go O
to O
sleep O
. O
Darcy O
took O
up O
a O
book O
; O
Miss O
Bingley O
did O
the O
same O
; O
and O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
, O
principally O
occupied O
in O
playing O
with O
her O
bracelets O
and O
rings O
, O
joined O
now O
and O
then O
in O
her O
brother O
's O
conversation O
with O
Miss O
Bennet O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
attention O
was O
quite O
as O
much O
engaged O
in O
watching O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
progress O
through O
his O
book O
, O
as O
in O
reading O
her O
own O
; O
and O
she O
was O
perpetually O
either O
making O
some O
inquiry O
, O
or O
looking O
at O
his O
page O
. O
She O
could O
not O
win O
him O
, O
however O
, O
to O
any O
conversation O
; O
he O
merely O
answered O
her O
question O
, O
and O
read O
on O
. O
At O
length O
, O
quite O
exhausted O
by O
the O
attempt O
to O
be O
amused O
with O
her O
own O
book O
, O
which O
she O
had O
only O
chosen O
because O
it O
was O
the O
second O
volume O
of O
his O
, O
she O
gave O
a O
great O
yawn O
and O
said O
, O
" O
How O
pleasant O
it O
is O
to O
spend O
an O
evening O
in O
this O
way O
! O
I O
declare O
after O
all O
there O
is O
no O
enjoyment O
like O
reading O
! O
How O
much O
sooner O
one O
tires O
of O
any O
thing O
than O
of O
a O
book O
! O
—When O
I O
have O
a O
house O
of O
my O
own O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
miserable O
if O
I O
have O
not O
an O
excellent O
library O
. O
" O
No O
one O
made O
any O
reply O
. O
She O
then O
yawned O
again O
, O
threw O
aside O
her O
book O
, O
and O
cast O
her O
eyes O
round O
the O
room O
in O
quest O
of O
some O
amusement O
; O
when O
hearing O
her O
brother O
mentioning O
a O
ball O
to O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
she O
turned O
suddenly O
towards O
him O
and O
said O
, O
" O
By O
the O
bye O
, O
Charles O
, O
are O
you O
really O
serious O
in O
meditating O
a O
dance O
at O
Netherfield O
? O
—I O
would O
advise O
you O
, O
before O
you O
determine O
on O
it O
, O
to O
consult O
the O
wishes O
of O
the O
present O
party O
; O
I O
am O
much O
mistaken O
if O
there O
are O
not O
some O
among O
us O
to O
whom O
a O
ball O
would O
be O
rather O
a O
punishment O
than O
a O
pleasure O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
mean O
Darcy O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
brother O
, O
" O
he O
may O
go O
to O
bed O
, O
if O
he O
chuses O
, O
before O
it O
begins—but O
as O
for O
the O
ball O
, O
it O
is O
quite O
a O
settled O
thing O
; O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
Nicholls O
has O
made O
white O
soup O
enough O
I O
shall O
send O
round O
my O
cards O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
like O
balls O
infinitely O
better O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
if O
they O
were O
carried O
on O
in O
a O
different O
manner O
; O
but O
there O
is O
something O
insufferably O
tedious O
in O
the O
usual O
process O
of O
such O
a O
meeting O
. O
It O
would O
surely O
be O
much O
more O
rational O
if O
conversation O
instead O
of O
dancing O
made O
the O
order O
of O
the O
day O
. O
" O
" O
Much O
more O
rational O
, O
my O
dear O
Caroline O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
but O
it O
would O
not O
be O
near O
so O
much O
like O
a O
ball O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bingley O
made O
no O
answer O
; O
and O
soon O
afterwards O
got O
up O
and O
walked O
about O
the O
room O
. O
Her O
figure O
was O
elegant O
, O
and O
she O
walked O
well O
; O
—but O
Darcy O
, O
at O
whom O
it O
was O
all O
aimed O
, O
was O
still O
inflexibly O
studious O
. O
In O
the O
desperation O
of O
her O
feelings O
she O
resolved O
on O
one O
effort O
more O
; O
and O
, O
turning O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
said O
, O
" O
Miss O
Eliza O
Bennet O
, O
let O
me O
persuade O
you O
to O
follow O
my O
example O
, O
and O
take O
a O
turn O
about O
the O
room.—I O
assure O
you O
it O
is O
very O
refreshing O
after O
sitting O
so O
long O
in O
one O
attitude O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
surprised O
, O
but O
agreed O
to O
it O
immediately O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
succeeded O
no O
less O
in O
the O
real O
object O
of O
her O
civility O
; O
Mr. O
Darcy O
looked O
up O
. O
He O
was O
as O
much O
awake O
to O
the O
novelty O
of O
attention O
in O
that O
quarter O
as O
Elizabeth O
herself O
could O
be O
, O
and O
unconsciously O
closed O
his O
book O
. O
He O
was O
directly O
invited O
to O
join O
their O
party O
, O
but O
he O
declined O
it O
, O
observing O
, O
that O
he O
could O
imagine O
but O
two O
motives O
for O
their O
chusing O
to O
walk O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
together O
, O
with O
either O
of O
which O
motives O
his O
joining O
them O
would O
interfere O
. O
" O
What O
could O
he O
mean O
? O
she O
was O
dying O
to O
know O
what O
could O
be O
his O
meaning O
" O
—and O
asked O
Elizabeth O
whether O
she O
could O
at O
all O
understand O
him O
? O
" O
Not O
at O
all O
, O
" O
was O
her O
answer O
; O
" O
but O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
he O
means O
to O
be O
severe O
on O
us O
, O
and O
our O
surest O
way O
of O
disappointing O
him O
, O
will O
be O
to O
ask O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
however O
, O
was O
incapable O
of O
disappointing O
Mr. O
Darcy O
in O
any O
thing O
, O
and O
persevered O
therefore O
in O
requiring O
an O
explanation O
of O
his O
two O
motives O
. O
" O
I O
have O
not O
the O
smallest O
objection O
to O
explaining O
them O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
allowed O
him O
to O
speak O
. O
" O
You O
either O
chuse O
this O
method O
of O
passing O
the O
evening O
because O
you O
are O
in O
each O
other O
's O
confidence O
and O
have O
secret O
affairs O
to O
discuss O
, O
or O
because O
you O
are O
conscious O
that O
your O
figures O
appear O
to O
the O
greatest O
advantage O
in O
walking O
; O
—if O
the O
first O
, O
I O
should O
be O
completely O
in O
your O
way O
; O
—and O
if O
the O
second O
, O
I O
can O
admire O
you O
much O
better O
as O
I O
sit O
by O
the O
fire O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
shocking O
! O
" O
cried O
Miss O
Bingley O
. O
" O
I O
never O
heard O
any O
thing O
so O
abominable O
. O
How O
shall O
we O
punish O
him O
for O
such O
a O
speech O
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
so O
easy O
, O
if O
you O
have O
but O
the O
inclination O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
We O
can O
all O
plague O
and O
punish O
one O
another O
. O
Tease O
him—laugh O
at O
him.—Intimate O
as O
you O
are O
, O
you O
must O
know O
how O
it O
is O
to O
be O
done O
. O
" O
" O
But O
upon O
my O
honour O
I O
do O
not O
. O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
that O
my O
intimacy O
has O
not O
yet O
taught O
me O
that O
. O
Tease O
calmness O
of O
temper O
and O
presence O
of O
mind O
! O
No O
, O
no—I O
feel O
he O
may O
defy O
us O
there O
. O
And O
as O
to O
laughter O
, O
we O
will O
not O
expose O
ourselves O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
by O
attempting O
to O
laugh O
without O
a O
subject O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
may O
hug O
himself O
. O
" O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
not O
to O
be O
laughed O
at O
! O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
That O
is O
an O
uncommon O
advantage O
, O
and O
uncommon O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
continue O
, O
for O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
loss O
to O
me O
to O
have O
many O
such O
acquaintance O
. O
I O
dearly O
love O
a O
laugh O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
has O
given O
me O
credit O
for O
more O
than O
can O
be O
. O
The O
wisest O
and O
the O
best O
of O
men O
, O
nay O
, O
the O
wisest O
and O
best O
of O
their O
actions O
, O
may O
be O
rendered O
ridiculous O
by O
a O
person O
whose O
first O
object O
in O
life O
is O
a O
joke O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth— O
" O
there O
are O
such O
people O
, O
but O
I O
hope O
I O
am O
not O
one O
of O
them O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
never O
ridicule O
what O
is O
wise O
or O
good O
. O
Follies O
and O
nonsense O
, O
whims O
and O
inconsistencies O
do O
divert O
me O
, O
I O
own O
, O
and O
I O
laugh O
at O
them O
whenever O
I O
can.—But O
these O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
are O
precisely O
what O
you O
are O
without O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
that O
is O
not O
possible O
for O
any O
one O
. O
But O
it O
has O
been O
the O
study O
of O
my O
life O
to O
avoid O
those O
weaknesses O
which O
often O
expose O
a O
strong O
understanding O
to O
ridicule O
. O
" O
" O
Such O
as O
vanity O
and O
pride O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
vanity O
is O
a O
weakness O
indeed O
. O
But O
pride—where O
there O
is O
a O
real O
superiority O
of O
mind O
, O
pride O
will O
be O
always O
under O
good O
regulation O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
turned O
away O
to O
hide O
a O
smile O
. O
" O
Your O
examination O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
over O
, O
I O
presume O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
; O
— O
" O
and O
pray O
what O
is O
the O
result O
? O
" O
" O
I O
am O
perfectly O
convinced O
by O
it O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
has O
no O
defect O
. O
He O
owns O
it O
himself O
without O
disguise O
. O
" O
" O
No O
" O
—said O
Darcy O
, O
" O
I O
have O
made O
no O
such O
pretension O
. O
I O
have O
faults O
enough O
, O
but O
they O
are O
not O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
of O
understanding O
. O
My O
temper O
I O
dare O
not O
vouch O
for.—It O
is O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
too O
little O
yielding—certainly O
too O
little O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
the O
world O
. O
I O
can O
not O
forget O
the O
follies O
and O
vices O
of O
others O
so O
soon O
as O
I O
ought O
, O
nor O
their O
offences O
against O
myself O
. O
My O
feelings O
are O
not O
puffed O
about O
with O
every O
attempt O
to O
move O
them O
. O
My O
temper O
would O
perhaps O
be O
called O
resentful O
. O
My O
good O
opinion O
once O
lost O
is O
lost O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
a O
failing O
indeed O
! O
" O
—cried O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
Implacable O
resentment O
is O
a O
shade O
in O
a O
character O
. O
But O
you O
have O
chosen O
your O
fault O
well.—I O
really O
can O
not O
laugh O
at O
it O
. O
You O
are O
safe O
from O
me O

" O
" O
There O
is O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
in O
every O
disposition O
a O
tendency O
to O
some O
particular O
evil O
, O
a O
natural O
defect O
, O
which O
not O
even O
the O
best O
education O
can O
overcome O
. O
" O
" O
And O
your O
defect O
is O
a O
propensity O
to O
hate O
every O
body O

yours O

" O
he O
replied O
, O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
" O
is O
wilfully O
to O
misunderstand O
them O

" O
" O
Do O
let O
us O
have O
a O
little O
music O
, O
" O
—cried O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
tired O
of O
a O
conversation O
in O
which O
she O
had O
no O
share.— O
" O
Louisa O
, O
you O
will O
not O
mind O
my O
waking O

Hurst O

" O
Her O
sister O
made O
not O
the O
smallest O
objection O

the O
piano-forte O
was O
opened O
; O
and O
Darcy O
, O
after O
a O
few O
moments O
' O
recollection O
, O
was O
not O
sorry O
for O
it O
. O
He O
began O
to O
feel O
the O
danger O

much O
attention O
