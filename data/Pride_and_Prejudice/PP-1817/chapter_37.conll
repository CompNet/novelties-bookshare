The O
two O
gentlemen O
left O
Rosings O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
having O
been O
in O
waiting O
near O
the O
lodges O
, O
to O
make O
them O
his O
parting O
obeisance O
, O
was O
able O
to O
bring O
home O
the O
pleasing O
intelligence O
, O
of O
their O
appearing O
in O
very O
good O
health O
, O
and O
in O
as O
tolerable O
spirits O
as O
could O
be O
expected O
, O
after O
the O
melancholy O
scene O
so O
lately O
gone O
through O
at O
Rosings O
. O
To O
Rosings O
he O
then O
hastened O
to O
console O
Lady O
Catherine O
and O
her O
daughter O
; O
and O
on O
his O
return O
, O
brought O
back O
, O
with O
great O
satisfaction O
, O
a O
message O
from O
her O
ladyship O
, O
importing O
that O
she O
felt O
herself O
so O
dull O
as O
to O
make O
her O
very O
desirous O
of O
having O
them O
all O
to O
dine O
with O
her O
. O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
see O
Lady O
Catherine O
without O
recollecting O
, O
that O
had O
she O
chosen O
it O
, O
she O
might O
by O
this O
time O
have O
been O
presented O
to O
her O
, O
as O
her O
future O
niece O
; O
nor O
could O
she O
think O
, O
without O
a O
smile O
, O
of O
what O
her O
ladyship O
's O
indignation O
would O
have O
been O
. O
" O
What O
would O
she O
have O
said O
? O
—how O
would O
she O
have O
behaved O
? O
" O
were O
questions O
with O
which O
she O
amused O
herself O
. O
Their O
first O
subject O
was O
the O
diminution O
of O
the O
Rosings O
party.— O
" O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
exceedingly O
, O
" O
said O
Lady O
Catherine O
; O
" O
I O
believe O
nobody O
feels O
the O
loss O
of O
friends O
so O
much O
as O
I O
do O
. O
But O
I O
am O
particularly O
attached O
to O
these O
young O
men O
; O
and O
know O
them O
to O
be O
so O
much O
attached O
to O
me O
! O
—They O
were O
excessively O
sorry O
to O
go O
! O
But O
so O
they O
always O
are O
. O
The O
dear O
colonel O
rallied O
his O
spirits O
tolerably O
till O
just O
at O
last O
; O
but O
Darcy O
seemed O
to O
feel O
it O
most O
acutely O
, O
more O
I O
think O
than O
last O
year O
. O
His O
attachment O
to O
Rosings O
certainly O
increases O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Collins O
had O
a O
compliment O
, O
and O
an O
allusion O
to O
throw O
in O
here O
, O
which O
were O
kindly O
smiled O
on O
by O
the O
mother O
and O
daughter O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
observed O
, O
after O
dinner O
, O
that O
Miss O
Bennet O
seemed O
out O
of O
spirits O
, O
and O
immediately O
accounting O
for O
it O
herself O
, O
by O
supposing O
that O
she O
did O
not O
like O
to O
go O
home O
again O
so O
soon O
, O
she O
added O
, O
" O
But O
if O
that O
is O
the O
case O
, O
you O
must O
write O
to O
your O
mother O
to O
beg O
that O
you O
may O
stay O
a O
little O
longer O
. O
Mrs. O
Collins O
will O
be O
very O
glad O
of O
your O
company O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
much O
obliged O
to O
your O
ladyship O
for O
your O
kind O
invitation O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
but O
it O
is O
not O
in O
my O
power O
to O
accept O
it.—I O
must O
be O
in O
town O
next O
Saturday O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
at O
that O
rate O
, O
you O
will O
have O
been O
here O
only O
six O
weeks O
. O
I O
expected O
you O
to O
stay O
two O
months O
. O
I O
told O
Mrs. O
Collins O
so O
before O
you O
came O
. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
occasion O
for O
your O
going O
so O
soon O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
could O
certainly O
spare O
you O
for O
another O
fortnight O
. O
" O
" O
But O
my O
father O
can O
not O
.—He O
wrote O
last O
week O
to O
hurry O
my O
return O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
your O
father O
of O
course O
may O
spare O
you O
, O
if O
your O
mother O
can O
. O
Daughters O
are O
never O
of O
so O
much O
consequence O
to O
a O
father O
. O
And O
if O
you O
will O
stay O
another O
month O
complete O
, O
it O
will O
be O
in O
my O
power O
to O
take O
one O
of O
you O
as O
far O
as O
London O
, O
for O
I O
am O
going O
there O
early O
in O
June O
, O
for O
a O
week O
; O
and O
as O
Dawson O
does O
not O
object O
to O
the O
Barouche O
box O
, O
there O
will O
be O
very O
good O
room O
for O
one O
of O
you—and O
indeed O
, O
if O
the O
weather O
should O
happen O
to O
be O
cool O
, O
I O
should O
not O
object O
to O
taking O
you O
both O
, O
as O
you O
are O
neither O
of O
you O
large O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
all O
kindness O
, O
madam O
; O
but O
I O
believe O
we O
must O
abide O
by O
our O
original O
plan O
. O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
seemed O
resigned.— O
" O
Mrs. O
Collins O
, O
you O
must O
send O
a O
servant O
with O
them O
. O
You O
know O
I O
always O
speak O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
the O
idea O
of O
two O
young O
women O
travelling O
post O
by O
themselves O
. O
It O
is O
highly O
improper O
. O
You O
must O
contrive O
to O
send O
somebody O
. O
I O
have O
the O
greatest O
dislike O
in O
the O
world O
to O
that O
sort O
of O
thing.—Young O
women O
should O
always O
be O
properly O
guarded O
and O
attended O
, O
according O
to O
their O
situation O
in O
life O
. O
When O
my O
niece O
Georgiana O
went O
to O
Ramsgate O
last O
summer O
, O
I O
made O
a O
point O
of O
her O
having O
two O
men O
servants O
go O
with O
her.—Miss O
Darcy O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
of O
Pemberley O
, O
and O
Lady O
Anne O
, O
could O
not O
have O
appeared O
with O
propriety O
in O
a O
different O
manner.—I O
am O
excessively O
attentive O
to O
all O
those O
things O
. O
You O
must O
send O
John O
with O
the O
young O
ladies O
, O
Mrs. O
Collins O
. O
I O
am O
glad O
it O
occurred O
to O
me O
to O
mention O
it O
; O
for O
it O
would O
really O
be O
discreditable O
to O
you O
to O
let O
them O
go O
alone O
. O
" O
" O
My O
uncle O
is O
to O
send O
a O
servant O
for O
us O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
—Your O
uncle O
! O
—He O
keeps O
a O
man-servant O
, O
does O
he O
? O
—I O
am O
very O
glad O
you O
have O
somebody O
who O
thinks O
of O
those O
things O
. O
Where O
shall O
you O
change O
horses O
? O
—Oh O
! O
—Bromley O
, O
of O
course O
. O
If O
you O
mention O
my O
name O
at O
the O
Bell O
, O
you O
will O
be O
attended O
to O
. O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
had O
many O
other O
questions O
to O
ask O
respecting O
their O
journey O
, O
and O
as O
she O
did O
not O
answer O
them O
all O
herself O
, O
attention O
was O
necessary O
, O
which O
Elizabeth O
believed O
to O
be O
lucky O
for O
her O
; O
or O
, O
with O
a O
mind O
so O
occupied O
, O
she O
might O
have O
forgotten O
where O
she O
was O
. O
Reflection O
must O
be O
reserved O
for O
solitary O
hours O
; O
whenever O
she O
was O
alone O
, O
she O
gave O
way O
to O
it O
as O
the O
greatest O
relief O
; O
and O
not O
a O
day O
went O
by O
without O
a O
solitary O
walk O
, O
in O
which O
she O
might O
indulge O
in O
all O
the O
delight O
of O
unpleasant O
recollections O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
letter O
she O
was O
in O
a O
fair O
way O
of O
soon O
knowing O
by O
heart O
. O
She O
studied O
every O
sentence O
: O
and O
her O
feelings O
towards O
its O
writer O
were O
at O
times O
widely O
different O
. O
When O
she O
remembered O
the O
style O
of O
his O
address O
, O
she O
was O
still O
full O
of O
indignation O
; O
but O
when O
she O
considered O
how O
unjustly O
she O
had O
condemned O
and O
upbraided O
him O
, O
her O
anger O
was O
turned O
against O
herself O
; O
and O
his O
disappointed O
feelings O
became O
the O
object O
of O
compassion O
. O
His O
attachment O
excited O
gratitude O
, O
his O
general O
character O
respect O
; O
but O
she O
could O
not O
approve O
him O
; O
nor O
could O
she O
for O
a O
moment O
repent O
her O
refusal O
, O
or O
feel O
the O
slightest O
inclination O
ever O
to O
see O
him O
again O
. O
In O
her O
own O
past O
behaviour O
, O
there O
was O
a O
constant O
source O
of O
vexation O
and O
regret O
; O
and O
in O
the O
unhappy O
defects O
of O
her O
family O
a O
subject O
of O
yet O
heavier O
chagrin O
. O
They O
were O
hopeless O
of O
remedy O
. O
Her O
father O
, O
contented O
with O
laughing O
at O
them O
, O
would O
never O
exert O
himself O
to O
restrain O
the O
wild O
giddiness O
of O
his O
youngest O
daughters O
; O
and O
her O
mother O
, O
with O
manners O
so O
far O
from O
right O
herself O
, O
was O
entirely O
insensible O
of O
the O
evil O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
frequently O
united O
with O
Jane O
in O
an O
endeavour O
to O
check O
the O
imprudence O
of O
Catherine O
and O
Lydia O
; O
but O
while O
they O
were O
supported O
by O
their O
mother O
's O
indulgence O
, O
what O
chance O
could O
there O
be O
of O
improvement O
? O
Catherine O
, O
weak-spirited O
, O
irritable O
, O
and O
completely O
under O
Lydia O
's O
guidance O
, O
had O
been O
always O
affronted O
by O
their O
advice O
; O
and O
Lydia O
, O
self-willed O
and O
careless O
, O
would O
scarcely O
give O
them O
a O
hearing O
. O
They O
were O
ignorant O
, O
idle O
, O
and O
vain O
. O
While O
there O
was O
an O
officer O
in O
Meryton O
, O
they O
would O
flirt O
with O
him O
; O
and O
while O
Meryton O
was O
within O
a O
walk O
of O
Longbourn O
, O
they O
would O
be O
going O
there O
for O
ever O
. O
Anxiety O
on O
Jane O
's O
behalf O
was O
another O
prevailing O
concern O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
explanation O
, O
by O
restoring O
Bingley O
to O
all O
her O
former O
good O
opinion O
, O
heightened O
the O
sense O
of O
what O
Jane O
had O
lost O
. O
His O
affection O
was O
proved O
to O
have O
been O
sincere O
, O
and O
his O
conduct O
cleared O
of O
all O
blame O
, O
unless O
any O
could O
attach O
to O
the O
implicitness O
of O
his O
confidence O
in O
his O
friend.—How O
grievous O
then O
was O
the O
thought O
that O
, O
of O
a O
situation O
so O
desirable O
in O
every O
respect O
, O
so O
replete O
with O
advantage O
, O
so O
promising O
for O
happiness O
, O
Jane O
had O
been O
deprived O
, O
by O
the O
folly O
and O
indecorum O
of O
her O
own O
family O
! O
When O
to O
these O
recollections O
was O
added O
the O
developement O
of O
Wickham O
's O
character O
, O
it O
may O
be O
easily O
believed O
that O
the O
happy O
spirits O
which O
had O
seldom O
been O
depressed O
before O
, O
were O
now O
so O
much O
affected O
as O
to O
make O
it O
almost O
impossible O
for O
her O
to O
appear O
tolerably O
cheerful O
. O
Their O
engagements O
at O
Rosings O
were O
as O
frequent O
during O
the O
last O
week O
of O
her O
stay O
as O
they O
had O
been O
at O
first O
. O
The O
very O
last O
evening O
was O
spent O
there O
; O
and O
her O
ladyship O
again O
inquired O
minutely O
into O
the O
particulars O
of O
their O
journey O
, O
gave O
them O
directions O
as O
to O
the O
best O
method O
of O
packing O
, O
and O
was O
so O
urgent O
on O
the O
necessity O
of O
placing O
gowns O
in O
the O
only O
right O
way O
, O
that O
Maria O
thought O
herself O
obliged O
, O
on O
her O
return O
, O
to O
undo O
all O
the O
work O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
pack O
her O
trunk O
afresh O
. O
When O
they O
parted O
, O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
with O
great O
condescension O
, O
wished O
them O
a O
good O
journey O
, O
and O
invited O
them O
to O
come O
to O
Hunsford O
again O
next O
year O
; O
and O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
exerted O
herself O
so O
far O
as O
to O
courtsey O
and O
hold O
out O
her O
hand O
to O
both O
. O
