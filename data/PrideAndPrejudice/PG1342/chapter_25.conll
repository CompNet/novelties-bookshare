After O
a O
week O
spent O
in O
professions O
of O
love O
and O
schemes O
of O
felicity O
, O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
was O
called O
from O
his O
amiable O
Charlotte O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
Saturday O
. O
The O
pain O
of O
separation O
, O
however O
, O
might O
be O
alleviated O
on O
his O
side O
by O
preparations O
for O
the O
reception O
of O
his O
bride O
, O
as O
he O
had O
reason O
to O
hope O
, O
that O
shortly O
after O
his O
next O
return O
into O
Hertfordshire O
, O
the O
day O
would O
be O
fixed O
that O
was O
to O
make O
him O
the O
happiest O
of O
men O
. O
He O
took O
leave O
of O
his O
relations O
at O
Longbourn O
with O
as O
much O
solemnity O
as O
before O
; O
wished O
his O
fair O
cousins O
health O
and O
happiness O
again O
, O
and O
promised O
their O
father O
another O
letter O
of O
thanks O
. O
On O
the O
following O
Monday O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
receiving O
her O
brother O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
who O
came O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
to O
spend O
the O
Christmas O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
was O
a O
sensible O
, O
gentlemanlike O
man O
, O
greatly O
superior O
to O
his O
sister O
, O
as O
well O
by O
nature O
as O
education O
. O
The O
Netherfield O
ladies O
would O
have O
had O
difficulty O
in O
believing O
that O
a O
man O
who O
lived O
by O
trade O
, O
and O
within O
view O
of O
his O
own O
warehouses O
, O
could O
have O
been O
so O
well-bred O
and O
agreeable O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
who O
was O
several O
years O
younger O
than O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
and O
Mrs. O
Philips O
, O
was O
an O
amiable O
, O
intelligent O
, O
elegant O
woman O
, O
and O
a O
great O
favourite O
with O
her O
Longbourn O
nieces O
. O
Between O
the O
two O
eldest O
and O
herself O
especially O
, O
there O
subsisted O
a O
very O
particular O
regard O
. O
They O
had O
frequently O
been O
staying O
with O
her O
in O
town O
. O
The O
first O
part O
of O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
's O
business O
, O
on O
her O
arrival O
, O
was O
to O
distribute O
her O
presents O
and O
describe O
the O
newest O
fashions O
. O
When O
this O
was O
done O
, O
she O
had O
a O
less O
active O
part O
to O
play O
. O
It O
became O
her O
turn O
to O
listen O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
many O
grievances O
to O
relate O
, O
and O
much O
to O
complain O
of O
. O
They O
had O
all O
been O
very O
ill-used O
since O
she O
last O
saw O
her O
sister O
. O
Two O
of O
her O
girls O
had O
been O
on O
the O
point O
of O
marriage O
, O
and O
after O
all O
there O
was O
nothing O
in O
it O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
blame O
Jane O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
" O
for O
Jane O
would O
have O
got O
Mr O
. O
Bingley O
if O
she O
could O
. O
But O
, O
Lizzy O
! O
Oh O
, O
sister O
! O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
think O
that O
she O
might O
have O
been O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
wife O
by O
this O
time O
, O
had O
not O
it O
been O
for O
her O
own O
perverseness O
. O
He O
made O
her O
an O
offer O
in O
this O
very O
room O
, O
and O
she O
refused O
him O
. O
The O
consequence O
of O
it O
is O
, O
that O
Lady O
Lucas O
will O
have O
a O
daughter O
married O
before O
I O
have O
, O
and O
that O
Longbourn O
estate O
is O
just O
as O
much O
entailed O
as O
ever O
. O
The O
Lucases O
are O
very O
artful O
people O
, O
indeed O
, O
sister O
. O
They O
are O
all O
for O
what O
they O
can O
get O
. O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
it O
of O
them O
, O
but O
so O
it O
is O
. O
It O
makes O
me O
very O
nervous O
and O
poorly O
, O
to O
be O
thwarted O
so O
in O
my O
own O
family O
, O
and O
to O
have O
neighbours O
who O
think O
of O
themselves O
before O
anybody O
else O
. O
However O
, O
your O
coming O
just O
at O
this O
time O
is O
the O
greatest O
of O
comforts O
, O
and O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
to O
hear O
what O
you O
tell O
us O
of O
long O
sleeves O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
to O
whom O
the O
chief O
of O
this O
news O
had O
been O
given O
before O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
's O
correspondence O
with O
her O
, O
made O
her O
sister O
a O
slight O
answer O
, O
and O
, O
in O
compassion O
to O
her O
nieces O
, O
turned O
the O
conversation O
. O
When O
alone O
with O
Elizabeth O
afterwards O
, O
she O
spoke O
more O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
" O
It O
seems O
likely O
to O
have O
been O
a O
desirable O
match O
for O
Jane O
, O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
it O
went O
off O
. O
But O
these O
things O
happen O
so O
often O
! O
A O
young O
man O
, O
such O
as O
you O
describe O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
so O
easily O
falls O
in O
love O
with O
a O
pretty O
girl O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
and O
, O
when O
accident O
separates O
them O
, O
so O
easily O
forgets O
her O
, O
that O
these O
sort O
of O
inconstancies O
are O
very O
frequent O
. O
" O
" O
An O
excellent O
consolation O
in O
its O
way O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
but O
it O
will O
not O
do O
for O
_us_ O
. O
We O
do O
not O
suffer O
by O
accident O
. O
It O
does O
not O
often O
happen O
that O
the O
interference O
of O
friends O
will O
persuade O
a O
young O
man O
of O
independent O
fortune O
to O
think O
no O
more O
of O
a O
girl O
whom O
he O
was O
violently O
in O
love O
with O
only O
a O
few O
days O
before O
. O
" O
" O
But O
that O
expression O
of O
'violently O
in O
love O
' O
is O
so O
hackneyed O
, O
so O
doubtful O
, O
so O
indefinite O
, O
that O
it O
gives O
me O
very O
little O
idea O
. O
It O
is O
as O
often O
applied O
to O
feelings O
which O
arise O
only O
from O
a O
half O
hour O
's O
acquaintance O
, O
as O
to O
a O
real O
, O
strong O
attachment O
. O
Pray O
, O
how O
_violent O
was_ O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
love O
? O
" O
" O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
more O
promising O
inclination O
; O
he O
was O
growing O
quite O
inattentive O
to O
other O
people O
, O
and O
wholly O
engrossed O
by O
her O
. O
Every O
time O
they O
met O
, O
it O
was O
more O
decided O
and O
remarkable O
. O
At O
his O
own O
ball O
he O
offended O
two O
or O
three O
young O
ladies O
by O
not O
asking O
them O
to O
dance O
; O
and O
I O
spoke O
to O
him O
twice O
myself O
without O
receiving O
an O
answer O
. O
Could O
there O
be O
finer O
symptoms O
? O
Is O
not O
general O
incivility O
the O
very O
essence O
of O
love O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
love O
which O
I O
suppose O
him O
to O
have O
felt O
. O
Poor O
Jane O
! O
I O
am O
sorry O
for O
her O
, O
because O
, O
with O
her O
disposition O
, O
she O
may O
not O
get O
over O
it O
immediately O
. O
It O
had O
better O
have O
happened O
to O
_you_ O
, O
Lizzy O
; O
you O
would O
have O
laughed O
yourself O
out O
of O
it O
sooner O
. O
But O
do O
you O
think O
she O
would O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
go O
back O
with O
us O
? O
Change O
of O
scene O
might O
be O
of O
service O
-- O
and O
perhaps O
a O
little O
relief O
from O
home O
may O
be O
as O
useful O
as O
anything O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
exceedingly O
pleased O
with O
this O
proposal O
, O
and O
felt O
persuaded O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
ready O
acquiescence O
. O
" O
I O
hope O
, O
" O
added O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
" O
that O
no O
consideration O
with O
regard O
to O
this O
young O
man O
will O
influence O
her O
. O
We O
live O
in O
so O
different O
a O
part O
of O
town O
, O
all O
our O
connections O
are O
so O
different O
, O
and O
, O
as O
you O
well O
know O
, O
we O
go O
out O
so O
little O
, O
that O
it O
is O
very O
improbable O
they O
should O
meet O
at O
all O
, O
unless O
he O
really O
comes O
to O
see O
her O
. O
" O
" O
And O
_that_ O
is O
quite O
impossible O
; O
for O
he O
is O
now O
in O
the O
custody O
of O
his O
friend O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
would O
no O
more O
suffer O
him O
to O
call O
on O
Jane O
in O
such O
a O
part O
of O
London O
! O
My O
dear O
aunt O
, O
how O
could O
you O
think O
of O
it O
? O
Mr. O
Darcy O
may O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
_heard_ O
of O
such O
a O
place O
as O
Gracechurch O
Street O
, O
but O
he O
would O
hardly O
think O
a O
month O
's O
ablution O
enough O
to O
cleanse O
him O
from O
its O
impurities O
, O
were O
he O
once O
to O
enter O
it O
; O
and O
, O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
never O
stirs O
without O
him O
. O
" O
" O
So O
much O
the O
better O
. O
I O
hope O
they O
will O
not O
meet O
at O
all O
. O
But O
does O
not O
Jane O
correspond O
with O
his O
sister O
? O
_She_ O
will O
not O
be O
able O
to O
help O
calling O
. O
" O
" O
She O
will O
drop O
the O
acquaintance O
entirely O
. O
" O
But O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
certainty O
in O
which O
Elizabeth O
affected O
to O
place O
this O
point O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
still O
more O
interesting O
one O
of O
Bingley O
's O
being O
withheld O
from O
seeing O
Jane O
, O
she O
felt O
a O
solicitude O
on O
the O
subject O
which O
convinced O
her O
, O
on O
examination O
, O
that O
she O
did O
not O
consider O
it O
entirely O
hopeless O
. O
It O
was O
possible O
, O
and O
sometimes O
she O
thought O
it O
probable O
, O
that O
his O
affection O
might O
be O
re-animated O
, O
and O
the O
influence O
of O
his O
friends O
successfully O
combated O
by O
the O
more O
natural O
influence O
of O
Jane O
's O
attractions O
. O
Miss O
Bennet O
accepted O
her O
aunt O
's O
invitation O
with O
pleasure O
; O
and O
the O
Bingleys O
were O
no O
otherwise O
in O
her O
thoughts O
at O
the O
same O
time O
than O
as O
she O
hoped O
, O
by O
Caroline O
's O
not O
living O
in O
the O
same O
house O
with O
her O
brother O
, O
she O
might O
occasionally O
spend O
a O
morning O
with O
her O
, O
without O
any O
danger O
of O
seeing O
him O
. O
The O
Gardiners O
stayed O
a O
week O
at O
Longbourn O
; O
and O
what O
with O
the O
Philipses O
, O
the O
Lucases O
, O
and O
the O
officers O
, O
there O
was O
not O
a O
day O
without O
its O
engagement O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
so O
carefully O
provided O
for O
the O
entertainment O
of O
her O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
that O
they O
did O
not O
once O
sit O
down O
to O
a O
family O
dinner O
. O
When O
the O
engagement O
was O
for O
home O
, O
some O
of O
the O
officers O
always O
made O
part O
of O
it O
, O
of O
which O
officers O
Mr. O
Wickham O
was O
sure O
to O
be O
one O
; O
and O
on O
these O
occasions O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
rendered O
suspicious O
by O
Elizabeth O
's O
warm O
commendation O
of O
him O
, O
narrowly O
observed O
them O
both O
. O
Without O
supposing O
them O
, O
from O
what O
she O
saw O
, O
to O
be O
very O
seriously O
in O
love O
, O
their O
preference O
of O
each O
other O
was O
plain O
enough O
to O
make O
her O
a O
little O
uneasy O
; O
and O
she O
resolved O
to O
speak O
to O
Elizabeth O
on O
the O
subject O
before O
she O
left O
Hertfordshire O
, O
and O
represent O
to O
her O
the O
imprudence O
of O
encouraging O
such O
an O
attachment O
. O
To O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
Wickham O
had O
one O
means O
of O
affording O
pleasure O
, O
unconnected O
with O
his O
general O
powers O
. O
About O
ten O
or O
a O
dozen O
years O
ago O
, O
before O
her O
marriage O
, O
she O
had O
spent O
a O
considerable O
time O
in O
that O
very O
part O
of O
Derbyshire O
to O
which O
he O
belonged O
. O
They O
had O
, O
therefore O
, O
many O
acquaintance O
in O
common O
; O
and O
, O
though O
Wickham O
had O
been O
little O
there O
since O
the O
death O
of O
Darcy O
's O
father O
, O
five O
years O
before O
, O
it O
was O
yet O
in O
his O
power O
to O
give O
her O
fresher O
intelligence O
of O
her O
former O
friends O
than O
she O
had O
been O
in O
the O
way O
of O
procuring O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
had O
seen O
Pemberley O
, O
and O
known O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Darcy O
by O
character O
perfectly O
well O
. O
Here O
, O
consequently O
, O
was O
an O
inexhaustible O
subject O
of O
discourse O
. O
In O
comparing O
her O
recollection O
of O
Pemberley O
with O
the O
minute O
description O
which O
Wickham O
could O
give O
, O
and O
in O
bestowing O
her O
tribute O
of O
praise O
on O
the O
character O
of O
its O
late O
possessor O
, O
she O
was O
delighting O
both O
him O
and O
herself O
. O
On O
being O
made O
acquainted O
with O
the O
present O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
treatment O
of O
him O
, O
she O
tried O
to O
remember O
something O
of O
that O
gentleman O
's O
reputed O
disposition O
, O
when O
quite O
a O
lad O
, O
which O
might O
agree O
with O
it O
; O
and O
was O
confident O
, O
at O
last O
, O
that O
she O
recollected O
having O
heard O
Mr. O
Fitzwilliam O
Darcy O
formerly O
spoken O
of O
as O
a O
very O
proud O
, O
ill-natured O
boy O
. O
