Elizabeth O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
receiving O
an O
answer O
to O
her O
letter O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
possibly O
could O
. O
She O
was O
no O
sooner O
in O
possession O
of O
it O
, O
than O
hurrying O
into O
the O
little O
copse O
, O
where O
she O
was O
least O
likely O
to O
be O
interrupted O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
on O
one O
of O
the O
benches O
, O
and O
prepared O
to O
be O
happy O
; O
for O
the O
length O
of O
the O
letter O
convinced O
her O
that O
it O
did O
not O
contain O
a O
denial O

" O
My O
dear O
Niece O
, O
" O
I O
have O
just O
received O
your O
letter O
, O
and O
shall O
devote O
this O
whole O
morning O
to O
answering O
it O
, O
as O
I O
foresee O
that O
a O
_little_ O
writing O
will O
not O
comprise O
what O
I O
have O
to O
tell O
you O
. O
I O
must O
confess O
myself O
surprised O
by O
your O
application O
; O
I O
did O
not O
expect O
it O
from O
_you_ O
. O
Do O
n't O
think O
me O
angry O
, O
however O
, O
for O
I O
only O
mean O
to O
let O
you O
know O
, O
that O
I O
had O
not O
imagined O
such O
inquiries O
to O
be O
necessary O
on O
_your_ O
side O
. O
If O
you O
do O
not O
choose O
to O
understand O
me O
, O
forgive O
my O
impertinence O
. O
Your O
uncle O
is O
as O
much O
surprised O
as O
I O
am O
; O
and O
nothing O
but O
the O
belief O
of O
your O
being O
a O
party O
concerned O
would O
have O
allowed O
him O
to O
act O
as O
he O
has O
done O
. O
But O
if O
you O
are O
really O
innocent O
and O
ignorant O
, O
I O
must O
be O
more O
explicit O
. O
On O
the O
very O
day O
of O
my O
coming O
home O
from O
Longbourn O
, O
your O
uncle O
had O
a O
most O
unexpected O
visitor O
. O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
called O
, O
and O
was O
shut O
up O
with O
him O
several O
hours O
. O
It O
was O
all O
over O
before O
I O
arrived O
; O
so O
my O
curiosity O
was O
not O
so O
dreadfully O
racked O
as O
_yours_ O
seems O
to O
have O
been O
. O
He O
came O
to O
tell O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
that O
he O
had O
found O
out O
where O
your O
sister O
and O
Mr. O
Wickham O
were O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
seen O
and O
talked O
with O
them O
both O
-- O
Wickham O
repeatedly O
, O
Lydia O
once O
. O
From O
what O
I O
can O
collect O
, O
he O
left O
Derbyshire O
only O
one O
day O
after O
ourselves O
, O
and O
came O
to O
town O
with O
the O
resolution O
of O
hunting O
for O
them O
. O
The O
motive O
professed O
was O
his O
conviction O
of O
its O
being O
owing O
to O
himself O
that O
Wickham O
's O
worthlessness O
had O
not O
been O
so O
well O
known O
as O
to O
make O
it O
impossible O
for O
any O
young O
woman O
of O
character O
to O
love O
or O
confide O
in O
him O
. O
He O
generously O
imputed O
the O
whole O
to O
his O
mistaken O
pride O
, O
and O
confessed O
that O
he O
had O
before O
thought O
it O
beneath O
him O
to O
lay O
his O
private O
actions O
open O
to O
the O
world O
. O
His O
character O
was O
to O
speak O
for O
itself O
. O
He O
called O
it O
, O
therefore O
, O
his O
duty O
to O
step O
forward O
, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
remedy O
an O
evil O
which O
had O
been O
brought O
on O
by O
himself O
. O
If O
he O
_had O
another_ O
motive O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
would O
never O
disgrace O
him O
. O
He O
had O
been O
some O
days O
in O
town O
before O
he O
was O
able O
to O
discover O
them O
; O
but O
he O
had O
something O
to O
direct O
his O
search O
, O
which O
was O
more O
than O
_we_ O
had O
; O
and O
the O
consciousness O
of O
this O
was O
another O
reason O
for O
his O
resolving O
to O
follow O
us O
. O
There O
is O
a O
lady O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
a O
Mrs. O
Younge O
, O
who O
was O
some O
time O
ago O
governess O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
and O
was O
dismissed O
from O
her O
charge O
on O
some O
cause O
of O
disapprobation O
, O
though O
he O
did O
not O
say O
what O
. O
She O
then O
took O
a O
large O
house O
in O
Edward O
Street O
, O
and O
has O
since O
maintained O
herself O
by O
letting O
lodgings O
. O
This O
Mrs O
. O
Younge O
was O
, O
he O
knew O
, O
intimately O
acquainted O
with O
Wickham O
; O
and O
he O
went O
to O
her O
for O
intelligence O
of O
him O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
got O
to O
town O
. O
But O
it O
was O
two O
or O
three O
days O
before O
he O
could O
get O
from O
her O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O
She O
would O
not O
betray O
her O
trust O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
without O
bribery O
and O
corruption O
, O
for O
she O
really O
did O
know O
where O
her O
friend O
was O
to O
be O
found O
. O
Wickham O
, O
indeed O
, O
had O
gone O
to O
her O
on O
their O
first O
arrival O
in O
London O
; O
and O
had O
she O
been O
able O
to O
receive O
them O
into O
her O
house O
, O
they O
would O
have O
taken O
up O
their O
abode O
with O
her O
. O
At O
length O
, O
however O
, O
our O
kind O
friend O
procured O
the O
wished-for O
direction O
. O
They O
were O
in O
-- O
-- O
Street O
. O
He O
saw O
Wickham O
, O
and O
afterwards O
insisted O
on O
seeing O
Lydia O
. O
His O
first O
object O
with O
her O
, O
he O
acknowledged O
, O
had O
been O
to O
persuade O
her O
to O
quit O
her O
present O
disgraceful O
situation O
, O
and O
return O
to O
her O
friends O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
could O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
receive O
her O
, O
offering O
his O
assistance O
as O
far O
as O
it O
would O
go O
. O
But O
he O
found O
Lydia O
absolutely O
resolved O
on O
remaining O
where O
she O
was O
. O
She O
cared O
for O
none O
of O
her O
friends O
; O
she O
wanted O
no O
help O
of O
his O
; O
she O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
leaving O
Wickham O
. O
She O
was O
sure O
they O
should O
be O
married O
some O
time O
or O
other O
, O
and O
it O
did O
not O
much O
signify O
when O
. O
Since O
such O
were O
her O
feelings O
, O
it O
only O
remained O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
to O
secure O
and O
expedite O
a O
marriage O
, O
which O
, O
in O
his O
very O
first O
conversation O
with O
Wickham O
, O
he O
easily O
learnt O
had O
never O
been O
_his_ O
design O
. O
He O
confessed O
himself O
obliged O
to O
leave O
the O
regiment O
on O
account O
of O
some O
debts O
of O
honour O
which O
were O
very O
pressing O
; O
and O
scrupled O
not O
to O
lay O
all O
the O
ill O
consequences O
of O
Lydia O
's O
flight O
on O
her O
own O
folly O
alone O
. O
He O
meant O
to O
resign O
his O
commission O
immediately O
; O
and O
as O
to O
his O
future O
situation O
, O
he O
could O
conjecture O
very O
little O
about O
it O
. O
He O
must O
go O
somewhere O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
know O
where O
, O
and O
he O
knew O
he O
should O
have O
nothing O
to O
live O
on O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
asked O
why O
he O
did O
not O
marry O
your O
sister O
at O
once O
. O
Though O
Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
not O
imagined O
to O
be O
very O
rich O
, O
he O
would O
have O
been O
able O
to O
do O
something O
for O
him O
, O
and O
his O
situation O
must O
have O
been O
benefited O
by O
marriage O
. O
But O
he O
found O
, O
in O
reply O
to O
this O
question O
, O
that O
Wickham O
still O
cherished O
the O
hope O
of O
more O
effectually O
making O
his O
fortune O
by O
marriage O
, O
in O
some O
other O
country O
. O
Under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
however O
, O
he O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
proof O
against O
the O
temptation O
of O
immediate O
relief O
. O
They O
met O
several O
times O
, O
for O
there O
was O
much O
to O
be O
discussed O
. O
Wickham O
, O
of O
course O
, O
wanted O
more O
than O
he O
could O
get O
; O
but O
at O
length O
was O
reduced O
to O
be O
reasonable O
. O
Everything O
being O
settled O
between O
_them_ O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
next O
step O
was O
to O
make O
your O
uncle O
acquainted O
with O
it O
, O
and O
he O
first O
called O
in O
Gracechurch O
Street O
the O
evening O
before O
I O
came O
home O
. O
But O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
could O
not O
be O
seen O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
found O
, O
on O
further O
inquiry O
, O
that O
your O
father O
was O
still O
with O
him O
, O
but O
would O
quit O
town O
the O
next O
morning O
. O
He O
did O
not O
judge O
your O
father O
to O
be O
a O
person O
whom O
he O
could O
so O
properly O
consult O
as O
your O
uncle O
, O
and O
therefore O
readily O
postponed O
seeing O
him O
till O
after O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
former O
. O
He O
did O
not O
leave O
his O
name O
, O
and O
till O
the O
next O
day O
it O
was O
only O
known O
that O
a O
gentleman O
had O
called O
on O
business O
. O
On O
Saturday O
he O
came O
again O
. O
Your O
father O
was O
gone O
, O
your O
uncle O
at O
home O
, O
and O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
, O
they O
had O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
talk O
together O
. O
They O
met O
again O
on O
Sunday O
, O
and O
then O
_I_ O
saw O
him O
too O
. O
It O
was O
not O
all O
settled O
before O
Monday O
: O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
, O
the O
express O
was O
sent O
off O
to O
Longbourn O
. O
But O
our O
visitor O
was O
very O
obstinate O
. O
I O
fancy O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
that O
obstinacy O
is O
the O
real O
defect O
of O
his O
character O
, O
after O
all O
. O
He O
has O
been O
accused O
of O
many O
faults O
at O
different O
times O
; O
but O
_this_ O
is O
the O
true O
one O
. O
Nothing O
was O
to O
be O
done O
that O
he O
did O
not O
do O
himself O
; O
though O
I O
am O
sure O
( O
and O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
it O
to O
be O
thanked O
, O
therefore O
say O
nothing O
about O
it O
) O
your O
uncle O
would O
most O
readily O
have O
settled O
the O
whole O
. O
They O
battled O
it O
together O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
which O
was O
more O
than O
either O
the O
gentleman O
or O
lady O
concerned O
in O
it O
deserved O
. O
But O
at O
last O
your O
uncle O
was O
forced O
to O
yield O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
being O
allowed O
to O
be O
of O
use O
to O
his O
niece O
, O
was O
forced O
to O
put O
up O
with O
only O
having O
the O
probable O
credit O
of O
it O
, O
which O
went O
sorely O
against O
the O
grain O
; O
and O
I O
really O
believe O
your O
letter O
this O
morning O
gave O
him O
great O
pleasure O
, O
because O
it O
required O
an O
explanation O
that O
would O
rob O
him O
of O
his O
borrowed O
feathers O
, O
and O
give O
the O
praise O
where O
it O
was O
due O
. O
But O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
this O
must O
go O
no O
further O
than O
yourself O
, O
or O
Jane O
at O
most O
. O
You O
know O
pretty O
well O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
what O
has O
been O
done O
for O
the O
young O
people O
. O
His O
debts O
are O
to O
be O
paid O
, O
amounting O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
to O
considerably O
more O
than O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
another O
thousand O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
own O
settled O
upon O
_her_ O
, O
and O
his O
commission O
purchased O
. O
The O
reason O
why O
all O
this O
was O
to O
be O
done O
by O
him O
alone O
, O
was O
such O
as O
I O
have O
given O
above O
. O
It O
was O
owing O
to O
him O
, O
to O
his O
reserve O
and O
want O
of O
proper O
consideration O
, O
that O
Wickham O
's O
character O
had O
been O
so O
misunderstood O
, O
and O
consequently O
that O
he O
had O
been O
received O
and O
noticed O
as O
he O
was O
. O
Perhaps O
there O
was O
some O
truth O
in O
_this_ O
; O
though O
I O
doubt O
whether O
_his_ O
reserve O
, O
or O
_anybody's_ O
reserve O
can O
be O
answerable O
for O
the O
event O
. O
But O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
this O
fine O
talking O
, O
my O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
you O
may O
rest O
perfectly O
assured O
that O
your O
uncle O
would O
never O
have O
yielded O
, O
if O
we O
had O
not O
given O
him O
credit O
for O
_another O
interest_ O
in O
the O
affair O
. O
When O
all O
this O
was O
resolved O
on O
, O
he O
returned O
again O
to O
his O
friends O
, O
who O
were O
still O
staying O
at O
Pemberley O
; O
but O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
he O
should O
be O
in O
London O
once O
more O
when O
the O
wedding O
took O
place O
, O
and O
all O
money O
matters O
were O
then O
to O
receive O
the O
last O
finish O
. O
I O
believe O
I O
have O
now O
told O
you O
everything O
. O
It O
is O
a O
relation O
which O
you O
tell O
me O
is O
to O
give O
you O
great O
surprise O
; O
I O
hope O
at O
least O
it O
will O
not O
afford O
you O
any O
displeasure O
. O
Lydia O
came O
to O
us O
, O
and O
Wickham O
had O
constant O
admission O
to O
the O
house O
. O
_He_ O
was O
exactly O
what O
he O
had O
been O
when O
I O
knew O
him O
in O
Hertfordshire O
; O
but O
I O
would O
not O
tell O
you O
how O
little O
I O
was O
satisfied O
with O
_her_ O
behaviour O
while O
she O
stayed O
with O
us O
, O
if O
I O
had O
not O
perceived O
, O
by O
Jane O
's O
letter O
last O
Wednesday O
, O
that O
her O
conduct O
on O
coming O
home O
was O
exactly O
of O
a O
piece O
with O
it O
, O
and O
therefore O
what O
I O
now O
tell O
you O
can O
give O
you O
no O
fresh O
pain O
. O
I O
talked O
to O
her O
repeatedly O
in O
the O
most O
serious O
manner O
, O
representing O
to O
her O
the O
wickedness O
of O
what O
she O
had O
done O
, O
and O
all O
the O
unhappiness O
she O
had O
brought O
on O
her O
family O
. O
If O
she O
heard O
me O
, O
it O
was O
by O
good O
luck O
, O
for O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
did O
not O
listen O
. O
I O
was O
sometimes O
quite O
provoked O
; O
but O
then O
I O
recollected O
my O
dear O
Elizabeth O
and O
Jane O
, O
and O
for O
their O
sakes O
had O
patience O
with O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
punctual O
in O
his O
return O
, O
and O
, O
as O
Lydia O
informed O
you O
, O
attended O
the O
wedding O
. O
He O
dined O
with O
us O
the O
next O
day O
, O
and O
was O
to O
leave O
town O
again O
on O
Wednesday O
or O
Thursday O
. O
Will O
you O
be O
very O
angry O
with O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
if O
I O
take O
this O
opportunity O
of O
saying O
( O
what O
I O
was O
never O
bold O
enough O
to O
say O
before O
) O
how O
much O
I O
like O
him O
? O
His O
behaviour O
to O
us O
has O
, O
in O
every O
respect O
, O
been O
as O
pleasing O
as O
when O
we O
were O
in O
Derbyshire O
. O
His O
understanding O
and O
opinions O
all O
please O
me O
; O
he O
wants O
nothing O
but O
a O
little O
more O
liveliness O
, O
and O
_that_ O
, O
if O
he O
marry O
_prudently_ O
, O
his O
wife O
may O
teach O
him O
. O
I O
thought O
him O
very O
sly O
; O
he O
hardly O
ever O
mentioned O
your O
name O

But O
slyness O
seems O
the O
fashion O
. O
Pray O
forgive O
me O
, O
if O
I O
have O
been O
very O
presuming O
, O
or O
at O
least O
do O
not O
punish O
me O
so O
far O
as O
to O
exclude O
me O
from O
P. O
I O
shall O
never O
be O
quite O
happy O
till O
I O
have O
been O
all O
round O
the O
park O
. O
A O
low O
phaeton O
with O
a O
nice O
little O
pair O
of O
ponies O
would O
be O
the O
very O
thing O
. O
But O
I O
must O
write O
no O
more O

The O
children O
have O
been O
wanting O
me O
this O
half O
hour O

The O
contents O
of O
this O
letter O
threw O
Elizabeth O
into O
a O
flutter O
of O
spirits O
, O
in O
which O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
determine O
whether O
pleasure O
or O
pain O
bore O
the O
greatest O
share O
. O
The O
vague O
and O
unsettled O
suspicions O
which O
uncertainty O
had O
produced O
, O
of O
what O
Mr. O
Darcy O
might O
have O
been O
doing O
to O
forward O
her O
sister O
's O
match O
-- O
which O
she O
had O
feared O
to O
encourage O
, O
as O
an O
exertion O
of O
goodness O
too O
great O
to O
be O
probable O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
dreaded O
to O
be O
just O
, O
from O
the O
pain O
of O
obligation O
-- O
were O
proved O
beyond O
their O
greatest O
extent O
to O
be O
true O
! O
He O
had O
followed O
them O
purposely O
to O
town O
, O
he O
had O
taken O
on O
himself O
all O
the O
trouble O
and O
mortification O
attendant O
on O
such O
a O
research O
; O
in O
which O
supplication O
had O
been O
necessary O
to O
a O
woman O
whom O
he O
must O
abominate O
and O
despise O
, O
and O
where O
he O
was O
reduced O
to O
meet O
, O
frequently O
meet O
, O
reason O
with O
, O
persuade O
, O
and O
finally O
bribe O
the O
man O
whom O
he O
always O
most O
wished O
to O
avoid O
, O
and O
whose O
very O
name O
it O
was O
punishment O
to O
him O
to O
pronounce O
. O
He O
had O
done O
all O
this O
for O
a O
girl O
whom O
he O
could O
neither O
regard O
nor O
esteem O
. O
Her O
heart O
did O
whisper O
that O
he O
had O
done O
it O
for O
her O
. O
But O
it O
was O
a O
hope O
shortly O
checked O
by O
other O
considerations O
; O
and O
she O
soon O
felt O
that O
even O
her O
vanity O
was O
insufficient O
, O
when O
required O
to O
depend O
on O
his O
affection O
for O
her O
, O
for O
a O
woman O
who O
had O
already O
refused O
him O
, O
as O
able O
to O
overcome O
a O
sentiment O
so O
natural O
as O
abhorrence O
against O
relationship O
with O
Wickham O
. O
Brother-in-law O
of O
Wickham O
! O
Every O
kind O
of O
pride O
must O
revolt O
from O
the O
connection O
. O
He O
had O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
done O
much O
. O
She O
was O
ashamed O
to O
think O
how O
much O
. O
But O
he O
had O
given O
a O
reason O
for O
his O
interference O
, O
which O
asked O
no O
extraordinary O
stretch O
of O
belief O
. O
It O
was O
reasonable O
that O
he O
should O
feel O
he O
had O
been O
wrong O
; O
he O
had O
liberality O
, O
and O
he O
had O
the O
means O
of O
exercising O
it O
; O
and O
though O
she O
would O
not O
place O
herself O
as O
his O
principal O
inducement O
, O
she O
could O
perhaps O
believe O
, O
that O
remaining O
partiality O
for O
her O
might O
assist O
his O
endeavours O
in O
a O
cause O
where O
her O
peace O
of O
mind O
must O
be O
materially O
concerned O
. O
It O
was O
painful O
, O
exceedingly O
painful O
, O
to O
know O
that O
they O
were O
under O
obligations O
to O
a O
person O
who O
could O
never O
receive O
a O
return O
. O
They O
owed O
the O
restoration O
of O
Lydia O
, O
her O
character O
, O
everything O
to O
him O
. O
Oh O
, O
how O
heartily O
did O
she O
grieve O
over O
every O
ungracious O
sensation O
she O
had O
ever O
encouraged O
, O
every O
saucy O
speech O
she O
had O
ever O
directed O
towards O
him O
! O
For O
herself O
she O
was O
humbled O
; O
but O
she O
was O
proud O
of O
him O
, O
-- O
proud O
that O
in O
a O
cause O
of O
compassion O
and O
honour O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
get O
the O
better O
of O
himself O
. O
She O
read O
over O
her O
aunt O
's O
commendation O
of O
him O
again O
and O
again O
. O
It O
was O
hardly O
enough O
; O
but O
it O
pleased O
her O
. O
She O
was O
even O
sensible O
of O
some O
pleasure O
, O
though O
mixed O
with O
regret O
, O
on O
finding O
how O
steadfastly O
both O
she O
and O
her O
uncle O
had O
been O
persuaded O
that O
affection O
and O
confidence O
subsisted O
between O
Mr. O
Darcy O
and O
herself O
. O
She O
was O
roused O
from O
her O
seat O
and O
her O
reflections O
, O
by O
someone O
's O
approach O
; O
and O
, O
before O
she O
could O
strike O
into O
another O
path O
, O
she O
was O
overtaken O
by O
Wickham O
. O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
interrupt O
your O
solitary O
ramble O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
as O
he O
joined O
her O
. O
" O
You O
certainly O
do O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
with O
a O
smile O
; O
" O
but O
it O
does O
not O
follow O
that O
the O
interruption O
must O
be O
unwelcome O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
it O
were O
. O
_We_ O
were O
always O
good O
friends O
, O
and O
now O
we O
are O
better O
. O
" O
" O
True O
. O
Are O
the O
others O
coming O
out O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
and O
Lydia O
are O
going O
in O
the O
carriage O
to O
Meryton O
. O
And O
so O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
, O
I O
find O
, O
from O
our O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
that O
you O
have O
actually O
seen O
Pemberley O
. O
" O
She O
replied O
in O
the O
affirmative O
. O
" O
I O
almost O
envy O
you O
the O
pleasure O
, O
and O
yet O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
too O
much O
for O
me O
, O
or O
else O
I O
could O
take O
it O
in O
my O
way O
to O
Newcastle O
. O
And O
you O
saw O
the O
old O
housekeeper O
, O
I O
suppose O
? O
Poor O
Reynolds O
, O
she O
was O
always O
very O
fond O
of O
me O
. O
But O
of O
course O
she O
did O
not O
mention O
my O
name O
to O
you O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
she O
did O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
did O
she O
say O
? O
" O
" O
That O
you O
were O
gone O
into O
the O
army O
, O
and O
she O
was O
afraid O
had O
-- O
not O
turned O
out O
well O
. O
At O
such O
a O
distance O
as O
_that_ O
, O
you O
know O
, O
things O
are O
strangely O
misrepresented O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
biting O
his O
lips O
. O
Elizabeth O
hoped O
she O
had O
silenced O
him O
; O
but O
he O
soon O
afterwards O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
Darcy O
in O
town O
last O
month O
. O
We O
passed O
each O
other O
several O
times O
. O
I O
wonder O
what O
he O
can O
be O
doing O
there O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
preparing O
for O
his O
marriage O
with O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
It O
must O
be O
something O
particular O
to O
take O
him O
there O
at O
this O
time O
of O
year O
. O
" O
" O
Undoubtedly O
. O
Did O
you O
see O
him O
while O
you O
were O
at O
Lambton O
? O
I O
thought O
I O
understood O
from O
the O
Gardiners O
that O
you O
had O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
he O
introduced O
us O
to O
his O
sister O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
like O
her O
? O
" O
" O
Very O
much O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
heard O
, O
indeed O
, O
that O
she O
is O
uncommonly O
improved O
within O
this O
year O
or O
two O
. O
When O
I O
last O
saw O
her O
, O
she O
was O
not O
very O
promising O
. O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
you O
liked O
her O
. O
I O
hope O
she O
will O
turn O
out O
well O
. O
" O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
will O
; O
she O
has O
got O
over O
the O
most O
trying O
age O
. O
" O
" O
Did O
you O
go O
by O
the O
village O
of O
Kympton O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
recollect O
that O
we O
did O
. O
" O
" O
I O
mention O
it O
because O
it O
is O
the O
living O
which O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
had O
. O
A O
most O
delightful O
place O
! O
Excellent O
parsonage-house O
! O
It O
would O
have O
suited O
me O
in O
every O
respect O
. O
" O
" O
How O
should O
you O
have O
liked O
making O
sermons O
? O
" O
" O
Exceedingly O
well O
. O
I O
should O
have O
considered O
it O
as O
part O
of O
my O
duty O
, O
and O
the O
exertion O
would O
soon O
have O
been O
nothing O
. O
One O
ought O
not O
to O
repine O
; O
but O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
such O
a O
thing O
for O
me O
! O
The O
quiet O
, O
the O
retirement O
of O
such O
a O
life O
, O
would O
have O
answered O
all O
my O
ideas O
of O
happiness O
! O
But O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
. O
Did O
you O
ever O
hear O
Darcy O
mention O
the O
circumstance O
when O
you O
were O
in O
Kent O
? O
" O
" O
I O
_have_ O
heard O
from O
authority O
, O
which O
I O
thought O
_as O
good_ O
, O
that O
it O
was O
left O
you O
conditionally O
only O
, O
and O
at O
the O
will O
of O
the O
present O
patron O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
! O
Yes O
, O
there O
was O
something O
in O
_that_ O
; O
I O
told O
you O
so O
from O
the O
first O
, O
you O
may O
remember O
. O
" O
" O
I O
_did_ O
hear O
, O
too O
, O
that O
there O
was O
a O
time O
when O
sermon-making O
was O
not O
so O
palatable O
to O
you O
as O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
at O
present O
; O
that O
you O
actually O
declared O
your O
resolution O
of O
never O
taking O
orders O
, O
and O
that O
the O
business O
had O
been O
compromised O
accordingly O
. O
" O
" O
You O
did O
! O
and O
it O
was O
not O
wholly O
without O
foundation O
. O
You O
may O
remember O
what O
I O
told O
you O
on O
that O
point O
, O
when O
first O
we O
talked O
of O
it O
. O
" O
They O
were O
now O
almost O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
house O
, O
for O
she O
had O
walked O
fast O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him O
; O
and O
unwilling O
, O
for O
her O
sister O
's O
sake O
, O
to O
provoke O
him O
, O
she O
only O
said O
in O
reply O
, O
with O
a O
good-humoured O
smile O
, O
-- O
" O
Come O
, O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
we O
are O
brother O
and O
sister O
, O
you O
know O
. O
Do O
not O
let O
us O
quarrel O
about O
the O
past O
. O
In O
future O
, O
I O
hope O
we O
shall O
be O
always O
of O
one O
mind O
. O
" O
She O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
: O
he O
kissed O
it O
with O
affectionate O
gallantry O
, O
though O
he O
hardly O
knew O
how O
to O
look O
, O
and O
they O
entered O
the O
house O
. O
