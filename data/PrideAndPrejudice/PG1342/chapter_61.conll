Happy O
for O
all O
her O
maternal O
feelings O
was O
the O
day O
on O
which O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
got O
rid O
of O
her O
two O
most O
deserving O
daughters O
. O
With O
what O
delighted O
pride O
she O
afterwards O
visited O
Mrs. O
Bingley O
, O
and O
talked O
of O
Mrs. O
Darcy O
, O
may O
be O
guessed O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
say O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
her O
family O
, O
that O
the O
accomplishment O
of O
her O
earnest O
desire O
in O
the O
establishment O
of O
so O
many O
of O
her O
children O
produced O
so O
happy O
an O
effect O
as O
to O
make O
her O
a O
sensible O
, O
amiable O
, O
well-informed O
woman O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
life O
; O
though O
, O
perhaps O
, O
it O
was O
lucky O
for O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
might O
not O
have O
relished O
domestic O
felicity O
in O
so O
unusual O
a O
form O
, O
that O
she O
still O
was O
occasionally O
nervous O
and O
invariably O
silly O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
missed O
his O
second O
daughter O
exceedingly O
; O
his O
affection O
for O
her O
drew O
him O
oftener O
from O
home O
than O
anything O
else O
could O
do O
. O
He O
delighted O
in O
going O
to O
Pemberley O
, O
especially O
when O
he O
was O
least O
expected O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
Jane O
remained O
at O
Netherfield O
only O
a O
twelvemonth O
. O
So O
near O
a O
vicinity O
to O
her O
mother O
and O
Meryton O
relations O
was O
not O
desirable O
even O
to O
_his_ O
easy O
temper O
, O
or O
_her_ O
affectionate O
heart O
. O
The O
darling O
wish O
of O
his O
sisters O
was O
then O
gratified O
: O
he O
bought O
an O
estate O
in O
a O
neighbouring O
county O
to O
Derbyshire O
; O
and O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
every O
other O
source O
of O
happiness O
, O
were O
within O
thirty O
miles O
of O
each O
other O
. O
Kitty O
, O
to O
her O
very O
material O
advantage O
, O
spent O
the O
chief O
of O
her O
time O
with O
her O
two O
elder O
sisters O
. O
In O
society O
so O
superior O
to O
what O
she O
had O
generally O
known O
, O
her O
improvement O
was O
great O
. O
She O
was O
not O
of O
so O
ungovernable O
a O
temper O
as O
Lydia O
; O
and O
, O
removed O
from O
the O
influence O
of O
Lydia O
's O
example O
, O
she O
became O
, O
by O
proper O
attention O
and O
management O
, O
less O
irritable O
, O
less O
ignorant O
, O
and O
less O
insipid O
. O
From O
the O
further O
disadvantage O
of O
Lydia O
's O
society O
she O
was O
of O
course O
carefully O
kept O
; O
and O
though O
Mrs. O
Wickham O
frequently O
invited O
her O
to O
come O
and O
stay O
with O
her O
, O
with O
the O
promise O
of O
balls O
and O
young O
men O
, O
her O
father O
would O
never O
consent O
to O
her O
going O
. O
Mary O
was O
the O
only O
daughter O
who O
remained O
at O
home O
; O
and O
she O
was O
necessarily O
drawn O
from O
the O
pursuit O
of O
accomplishments O
by O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
being O
quite O
unable O
to O
sit O
alone O
. O
Mary O
was O
obliged O
to O
mix O
more O
with O
the O
world O
, O
but O
she O
could O
still O
moralize O
over O
every O
morning O
visit O
; O
and O
as O
she O
was O
no O
longer O
mortified O
by O
comparisons O
between O
her O
sisters O
' O
beauty O
and O
her O
own O
, O
it O
was O
suspected O
by O
her O
father O
that O
she O
submitted O
to O
the O
change O
without O
much O
reluctance O
. O
As O
for O
Wickham O
and O
Lydia O
, O
their O
characters O
suffered O
no O
revolution O
from O
the O
marriage O
of O
her O
sisters O
. O
He O
bore O
with O
philosophy O
the O
conviction O
that O
Elizabeth O
must O
now O
become O
acquainted O
with O
whatever O
of O
his O
ingratitude O
and O
falsehood O
had O
before O
been O
unknown O
to O
her O
; O
and O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
everything O
, O
was O
not O
wholly O
without O
hope O
that O
Darcy O
might O
yet O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
make O
his O
fortune O
. O
The O
congratulatory O
letter O
which O
Elizabeth O
received O
from O
Lydia O
on O
her O
marriage O
explained O
to O
her O
that O
, O
by O
his O
wife O
at O
least O
, O
if O
not O
by O
himself O
, O
such O
a O
hope O
was O
cherished O
. O
The O
letter O
was O
to O
this O
effect O
: O
-- O
/ O
* O
" O
My O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
* O
/ O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
joy O
. O
If O
you O
love O
Mr. O
Darcy O
half O
so O
well O
as O
I O
do O
my O
dear O
Wickham O
, O
you O
must O
be O
very O
happy O
. O
It O
is O
a O
great O
comfort O
to O
have O
you O
so O
rich O
; O
and O
when O
you O
have O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
, O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
think O
of O
us O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
Wickham O
would O
like O
a O
place O
at O
court O
very O
much O
; O
and O
I O
do O
not O
think O
we O
shall O
have O
quite O
money O
enough O
to O
live O
upon O
without O
some O
help O
. O
Any O
place O
would O
do O
of O
about O
three O
or O
four O
hundred O
a O
year O
; O
but O
, O
however O
, O
do O
not O
speak O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
about O
it O
, O
if O
you O
had O
rather O
not O
. O
" O
Yours O
, O
" O
etc O
. O
As O
it O
happened O
that O
Elizabeth O
had O
much O
rather O
not O
, O
she O
endeavoured O
in O
her O
answer O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
every O
entreaty O
and O
expectation O
of O
the O
kind O
. O
Such O
relief O
, O
however O
, O
as O
it O
was O
in O
her O
power O
to O
afford O
, O
by O
the O
practice O
of O
what O
might O
be O
called O
economy O
in O
her O
own O
private O
expenses O
, O
she O
frequently O
sent O
them O
. O
It O
had O
always O
been O
evident O
to O
her O
that O
such O
an O
income O
as O
theirs O
, O
under O
the O
direction O
of O
two O
persons O
so O
extravagant O
in O
their O
wants O
, O
and O
heedless O
of O
the O
future O
, O
must O
be O
very O
insufficient O
to O
their O
support O
; O
and O
whenever O
they O
changed O
their O
quarters O
, O
either O
Jane O
or O
herself O
were O
sure O
of O
being O
applied O
to O
for O
some O
little O
assistance O
towards O
discharging O
their O
bills O
. O
Their O
manner O
of O
living O
, O
even O
when O
the O
restoration O
of O
peace O
dismissed O
them O
to O
a O
home O
, O
was O
unsettled O
in O
the O
extreme O
. O
They O
were O
always O
moving O
from O
place O
to O
place O
in O
quest O
of O
a O
cheap O
situation O
, O
and O
always O
spending O
more O
than O
they O
ought O
. O
His O
affection O
for O
her O
soon O
sunk O
into O
indifference O
: O
hers O
lasted O
a O
little O
longer O
; O
and O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
youth O
and O
her O
manners O
, O
she O
retained O
all O
the O
claims O
to O
reputation O
which O
her O
marriage O
had O
given O
her O
. O
Though O
Darcy O
could O
never O
receive O
_him_ O
at O
Pemberley O
, O
yet O
, O
for O
Elizabeth O
's O
sake O
, O
he O
assisted O
him O
further O
in O
his O
profession O
. O
Lydia O
was O
occasionally O
a O
visitor O
there O
, O
when O
her O
husband O
was O
gone O
to O
enjoy O
himself O
in O
London O
or O
Bath O
; O
and O
with O
the O
Bingleys O
they O
both O
of O
them O
frequently O
stayed O
so O
long O
, O
that O
even O
Bingley O
's O
good-humour O
was O
overcome O
, O
and O
he O
proceeded O
so O
far O
as O
to O
_talk_ O
of O
giving O
them O
a O
hint O
to O
be O
gone O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
very O
deeply O
mortified O
by O
Darcy O
's O
marriage O
; O
but O
as O
she O
thought O
it O
advisable O
to O
retain O
the O
right O
of O
visiting O
at O
Pemberley O
, O
she O
dropped O
all O
her O
resentment O
; O
was O
fonder O
than O
ever O
of O
Georgiana O
, O
almost O
as O
attentive O
to O
Darcy O
as O
heretofore O
, O
and O
paid O
off O
every O
arrear O
of O
civility O
to O
Elizabeth O
. O
Pemberley O
was O
now O
Georgiana O
's O
home O
; O
and O
the O
attachment O
of O
the O
sisters O
was O
exactly O
what O
Darcy O
had O
hoped O
to O
see O
. O
They O
were O
able O
to O
love O
each O
other O
, O
even O
as O
well O
as O
they O
intended O
. O
Georgiana O
had O
the O
highest O
opinion O
in O
the O
world O
of O
Elizabeth O
; O
though O
at O
first O
she O
often O
listened O
with O
an O
astonishment O
bordering O
on O
alarm O
at O
her O
lively O
, O
sportive O
manner O
of O
talking O
to O
her O
brother O
. O
He O
, O
who O
had O
always O
inspired O
in O
herself O
a O
respect O
which O
almost O
overcame O
her O
affection O
, O
she O
now O
saw O
the O
object O
of O
open O
pleasantry O
. O
Her O
mind O
received O
knowledge O
which O
had O
never O
before O
fallen O
in O
her O
way O
. O
By O
Elizabeth O
's O
instructions O
she O
began O
to O
comprehend O
that O
a O
woman O
may O
take O
liberties O
with O
her O
husband O
, O
which O
a O
brother O
will O
not O
always O
allow O
in O
a O
sister O
more O
than O
ten O
years O
younger O
than O
himself O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
was O
extremely O
indignant O
on O
the O
marriage O
of O
her O
nephew O
; O
and O
as O
she O
gave O
way O
to O
all O
the O
genuine O
frankness O
of O
her O
character O
, O
in O
her O
reply O
to O
the O
letter O
which O
announced O
its O
arrangement O
, O
she O
sent O
him O
language O
so O
very O
abusive O
, O
especially O
of O
Elizabeth O
, O
that O
for O
some O
time O
all O
intercourse O
was O
at O
an O
end O
. O
But O
at O
length O
, O
by O
Elizabeth O
's O
persuasion O
, O
he O
was O
prevailed O
on O
to O
overlook O
the O
offence O
, O
and O
seek O
a O
reconciliation O
; O
and O
, O
after O
a O
little O
further O
resistance O
on O
the O
part O
of O
his O
aunt O
, O
her O
resentment O
gave O
way O
, O
either O
to O
her O
affection O
for O
him O
, O
or O
her O
curiosity O
to O
see O
how O
his O
wife O
conducted O
herself O
; O
and O
she O
condescended O
to O
wait O
on O
them O
at O
Pemberley O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
that O
pollution O
which O
its O
woods O
had O
received O
, O
not O
merely O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
such O
a O
mistress O
, O
but O
the O
visits O
of O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
from O
the O
city O
. O
With O
the O
Gardiners O
they O
were O
always O
on O
the O
most O
intimate O
terms O
. O
Darcy O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Elizabeth O
, O
really O
loved O
them O
; O
and O
they O
were O
both O
ever O
sensible O
of O
the O
warmest O
gratitude O
towards O
the O
persons O
who O
, O
by O
bringing O
her O
into O
Derbyshire O
, O
had O
been O
the O
means O
of O
uniting O
them O
. O
