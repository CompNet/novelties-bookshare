Elizabeth O
, O
as O
they O
drove O
along O
, O
watched O
for O
the O
first O
appearance O
of O
Pemberley O
Woods O
with O
some O
perturbation O
; O
and O
when O
at O
length O
they O
turned O
in O
at O
the O
lodge O
, O
her O
spirits O
were O
in O
a O
high O
flutter O
. O
The O
park O
was O
very O
large O
, O
and O
contained O
great O
variety O
of O
ground O
. O
They O
entered O
it O
in O
one O
of O
its O
lowest O
points O
, O
and O
drove O
for O
some O
time O
through O
a O
beautiful O
wood O
stretching O
over O
a O
wide O
extent O
. O
Elizabeth O
's O
mind O
was O
too O
full O
for O
conversation O
, O
but O
she O
saw O
and O
admired O
every O
remarkable O
spot O
and O
point O
of O
view O
. O
They O
gradually O
ascended O
for O
half O
a O
mile O
, O
and O
then O
found O
themselves O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
considerable O
eminence O
, O
where O
the O
wood O
ceased O
, O
and O
the O
eye O
was O
instantly O
caught O
by O
Pemberley O
House O
, O
situated O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
valley O
, O
into O
which O
the O
road O
with O
some O
abruptness O
wound O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
, O
handsome O
stone O
building O
, O
standing O
well O
on O
rising O
ground O
, O
and O
backed O
by O
a O
ridge O
of O
high O
woody O
hills O
; O
and O
in O
front O
a O
stream O
of O
some O
natural O
importance O
was O
swelled O
into O
greater O
, O
but O
without O
any O
artificial O
appearance O
. O
Its O
banks O
were O
neither O
formal O
nor O
falsely O
adorned O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
delighted O
. O
She O
had O
never O
seen O
a O
place O
for O
which O
nature O
had O
done O
more O
, O
or O
where O
natural O
beauty O
had O
been O
so O
little O
counteracted O
by O
an O
awkward O
taste O
. O
They O
were O
all O
of O
them O
warm O
in O
their O
admiration O
; O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
she O
felt O
that O
to O
be O
mistress O
of O
Pemberley O
might O
be O
something O
! O
They O
descended O
the O
hill O
, O
crossed O
the O
bridge O
, O
and O
drove O
to O
the O
door O
; O
and O
, O
while O
examining O
the O
nearer O
aspect O
of O
the O
house O
, O
all O
her O
apprehension O
of O
meeting O
its O
owner O
returned O
. O
She O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
chambermaid O
had O
been O
mistaken O
. O
On O
applying O
to O
see O
the O
place O
, O
they O
were O
admitted O
into O
the O
hall O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
as O
they O
waited O
for O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
had O
leisure O
to O
wonder O
at O
her O
being O
where O
she O
was O
. O
The O
housekeeper O
came O
; O
a O
respectable O
looking O
elderly O
woman O
, O
much O
less O
fine O
, O
and O
more O
civil O
, O
than O
she O
had O
any O
notion O
of O
finding O
her O
. O
They O
followed O
her O
into O
the O
dining-parlour O
. O
It O
was O
a O
large O
, O
well-proportioned O
room O
, O
handsomely O
fitted O
up O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
after O
slightly O
surveying O
it O
, O
went O
to O
a O
window O
to O
enjoy O
its O
prospect O
. O
The O
hill O
, O
crowned O
with O
wood O
, O
from O
which O
they O
had O
descended O
, O
receiving O
increased O
abruptness O
from O
the O
distance O
, O
was O
a O
beautiful O
object O
. O
Every O
disposition O
of O
the O
ground O
was O
good O
; O
and O
she O
looked O
on O
the O
whole O
scene O
, O
the O
river O
, O
the O
trees O
scattered O
on O
its O
banks O
, O
and O
the O
winding O
of O
the O
valley O
, O
as O
far O
as O
she O
could O
trace O
it O
, O
with O
delight O
. O
As O
they O
passed O
into O
other O
rooms O
, O
these O
objects O
were O
taking O
different O
positions O
; O
but O
from O
every O
window O
there O
were O
beauties O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
The O
rooms O
were O
lofty O
and O
handsome O
, O
and O
their O
furniture O
suitable O
to O
the O
fortune O
of O
their O
proprietor O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
saw O
, O
with O
admiration O
of O
his O
taste O
, O
that O
it O
was O
neither O
gaudy O
nor O
uselessly O
fine O
, O
-- O
with O
less O
of O
splendour O
, O
and O
more O
real O
elegance O
, O
than O
the O
furniture O
of O
Rosings O
. O
" O
And O
of O
this O
place O
, O
" O
thought O
she O
, O
" O
I O
might O
have O
been O
mistress O
! O
With O
these O
rooms O
I O
might O
have O
now O
been O
familiarly O
acquainted O
! O
Instead O
of O
viewing O
them O
as O
a O
stranger O
, O
I O
might O
have O
rejoiced O
in O
them O
as O
my O
own O
, O
and O
welcomed O
to O
them O
as O
visitors O
my O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
. O
But O
, O
no O
, O
" O
recollecting O
herself O
, O
" O
that O
could O
never O
be O
; O
my O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
would O
have O
been O
lost O
to O
me O
; O
I O
should O
not O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
invite O
them O
. O
" O
This O
was O
a O
lucky O
recollection O
-- O
it O
saved O
her O
from O
something O
like O
regret O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
inquire O
of O
the O
housekeeper O
whether O
her O
master O
were O
really O
absent O
, O
but O
had O
not O
courage O
for O
it O
. O
At O
length O
, O
however O
, O
the O
question O
was O
asked O
by O
her O
uncle O
; O
and O
she O
turned O
away O
with O
alarm O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
replied O
, O
that O
he O
was O
; O
adding O
, O
" O
But O
we O
expect O
him O
to-morrow O
, O
with O
a O
large O
party O
of O
friends O
. O
" O
How O
rejoiced O
was O
Elizabeth O
that O
their O
own O
journey O
had O
not O
by O
any O
circumstance O
been O
delayed O
a O
day O
! O
Her O
aunt O
now O
called O
her O
to O
look O
at O
a O
picture O
. O
She O
approached O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
likeness O
of O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
suspended O
, O
amongst O
several O
other O
miniatures O
, O
over O
the O
mantel-piece O
. O
Her O
aunt O
asked O
her O
, O
smilingly O
, O
how O
she O
liked O
it O
. O
The O
housekeeper O
came O
forward O
, O
and O
told O
them O
it O
was O
the O
picture O
of O
a O
young O
gentleman O
, O
the O
son O
of O
her O
late O
master O
's O
steward O
, O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
by O
him O
at O
his O
own O
expense O
. O
" O
He O
is O
now O
gone O
into O
the O
army O
, O
" O
she O
added O
; O
" O
but O
I O
am O
afraid O
he O
has O
turned O
out O
very O
wild O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
looked O
at O
her O
niece O
with O
a O
smile O
, O
but O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
return O
it O
. O
" O
And O
that O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
, O
pointing O
to O
another O
of O
the O
miniatures O
, O
" O
is O
my O
master O
-- O
and O
very O
like O
him O
. O
It O
was O
drawn O
at O
the O
same O
time O
as O
the O
other O
-- O
about O
eight O
years O
ago O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
heard O
much O
of O
your O
master O
's O
fine O
person O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
picture O
; O
" O
it O
is O
a O
handsome O
face O
. O
But O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
you O
can O
tell O
us O
whether O
it O
is O
like O
or O
not O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
' O
respect O
for O
Elizabeth O
seemed O
to O
increase O
on O
this O
intimation O
of O
her O
knowing O
her O
master O
. O
" O
Does O
that O
young O
lady O
know O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
coloured O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
A O
little O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
not O
you O
think O
him O
a O
very O
handsome O
gentleman O
, O
ma'am O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
very O
handsome O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
_I_ O
know O
none O
so O
handsome O
; O
but O
in O
the O
gallery O
upstairs O
you O
will O
see O
a O
finer O
, O
larger O
picture O
of O
him O
than O
this O
. O
This O
room O
was O
my O
late O
master O
's O
favourite O
room O
, O
and O
these O
miniatures O
are O
just O
as O
they O
used O
to O
be O
then O
. O
He O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
them O
. O
" O
This O
accounted O
to O
Elizabeth O
for O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
being O
among O
them O
. O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
then O
directed O
their O
attention O
to O
one O
of O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
drawn O
when O
she O
was O
only O
eight O
years O
old O
. O
" O
And O
is O
Miss O
Darcy O
as O
handsome O
as O
her O
brother O
? O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
-- O
the O
handsomest O
young O
lady O
that O
ever O
was O
seen O
; O
and O
so O
accomplished O
! O
She O
plays O
and O
sings O
all O
day O
long O
. O
In O
the O
next O
room O
is O
a O
new O
instrument O
just O
come O
down O
for O
her O
-- O
a O
present O
from O
my O
master O
: O
she O
comes O
here O
to-morrow O
with O
him O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
whose O
manners O
were O
easy O
and O
pleasant O
, O
encouraged O
her O
communicativeness O
by O
his O
questions O
and O
remarks O
: O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
, O
either O
from O
pride O
or O
attachment O
, O
had O
evidently O
great O
pleasure O
in O
talking O
of O
her O
master O
and O
his O
sister O
. O
" O
Is O
your O
master O
much O
at O
Pemberley O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
year O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
so O
much O
as O
I O
could O
wish O
, O
sir O
: O
but O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
may O
spend O
half O
his O
time O
here O
; O
and O
Miss O
Darcy O
is O
always O
down O
for O
the O
summer O
months O
. O
" O
" O
Except O
, O
" O
thought O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
when O
she O
goes O
to O
Ramsgate O
. O
" O
" O
If O
your O
master O
would O
marry O
, O
you O
might O
see O
more O
of O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
; O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
when O
_that_ O
will O
be O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
who O
is O
good O
enough O
for O
him O
. O
" O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
smiled O
. O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
help O
saying O
, O
" O
It O
is O
very O
much O
to O
his O
credit O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
that O
you O
should O
think O
so O
. O
" O
" O
I O
say O
no O
more O
than O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
what O
everybody O
will O
say O
that O
knows O
him O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
other O
. O
Elizabeth O
thought O
this O
was O
going O
pretty O
far O
; O
and O
she O
listened O
with O
increasing O
astonishment O
as O
the O
housekeeper O
added O
, O
" O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
cross O
word O
from O
him O
in O
my O
life O
, O
and O
I O
have O
known O
him O
ever O
since O
he O
was O
four O
years O
old O
. O
" O
This O
was O
praise O
of O
all O
others O
most O
extraordinary O
, O
most O
opposite O
to O
her O
ideas O
. O
That O
he O
was O
not O
a O
good-tempered O
man O
had O
been O
her O
firmest O
opinion O
. O
Her O
keenest O
attention O
was O
awakened O
: O
she O
longed O
to O
hear O
more O
; O
and O
was O
grateful O
to O
her O
uncle O
for O
saying O
, O
-- O
" O
There O
are O
very O
few O
people O
of O
whom O
so O
much O
can O
be O
said O
. O
You O
are O
lucky O
in O
having O
such O
a O
master O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
know O
I O
am O
. O
If O
I O
were O
to O
go O
through O
the O
world O
, O
I O
could O
not O
meet O
with O
a O
better O
. O
But O
I O
have O
always O
observed O
, O
that O
they O
who O
are O
good-natured O
when O
children O
, O
are O
good-natured O
when O
they O
grow O
up O
; O
and O
he O
was O
always O
the O
sweetest O
tempered O
, O
most O
generous-hearted O
boy O
in O
the O
world O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
almost O
stared O
at O
her O
. O
" O
Can O
this O
be O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
? O
" O
thought O
she O
. O
" O
His O
father O
was O
an O
excellent O
man O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
ma'am O
, O
that O
he O
was O
indeed O
; O
and O
his O
son O
will O
be O
just O
like O
him O
-- O
just O
as O
affable O
to O
the O
poor O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
listened O
, O
wondered O
, O
doubted O
, O
and O
was O
impatient O
for O
more O
. O
Mrs O
. O
Reynolds O
could O
interest O
her O
on O
no O
other O
point O
. O
She O
related O
the O
subjects O
of O
the O
pictures O
, O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
rooms O
, O
and O
the O
price O
of O
the O
furniture O
in O
vain O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
highly O
amused O
by O
the O
kind O
of O
family O
prejudice O
, O
to O
which O
he O
attributed O
her O
excessive O
commendation O
of O
her O
master O
, O
soon O
led O
again O
to O
the O
subject O
; O
and O
she O
dwelt O
with O
energy O
on O
his O
many O
merits O
, O
as O
they O
proceeded O
together O
up O
the O
great O
staircase O
. O
" O
He O
is O
the O
best O
landlord O
, O
and O
the O
best O
master O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
that O
ever O
lived O
. O
Not O
like O
the O
wild O
young O
men O
now-a-days O
, O
who O
think O
of O
nothing O
but O
themselves O
. O
There O
is O
not O
one O
of O
his O
tenants O
or O
servants O
but O
what O
will O
give O
him O
a O
good O
name O
. O
Some O
people O
call O
him O
proud O
; O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
never O
saw O
anything O
of O
it O
. O
To O
my O
fancy O
, O
it O
is O
only O
because O
he O
does O
not O
rattle O
away O
like O
other O
young O
men O
. O
" O
" O
In O
what O
an O
amiable O
light O
does O
this O
place O
him O
! O
" O
thought O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
This O
fine O
account O
of O
him O
, O
" O
whispered O
her O
aunt O
as O
they O
walked O
, O
" O
is O
not O
quite O
consistent O
with O
his O
behaviour O
to O
our O
poor O
friend O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
we O
might O
be O
deceived O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
not O
very O
likely O
; O
our O
authority O
was O
too O
good O
. O
" O
On O
reaching O
the O
spacious O
lobby O
above O
, O
they O
were O
shown O
into O
a O
very O
pretty O
sitting-room O
, O
lately O
fitted O
up O
with O
greater O
elegance O
and O
lightness O
than O
the O
apartments O
below O
; O
and O
were O
informed O
that O
it O
was O
but O
just O
done O
to O
give O
pleasure O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
who O
had O
taken O
a O
liking O
to O
the O
room O
, O
when O
last O
at O
Pemberley O
. O
" O
He O
is O
certainly O
a O
good O
brother O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
as O
she O
walked O
towards O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
. O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
anticipated O
Miss O
Darcy O
's O
delight O
, O
when O
she O
should O
enter O
the O
room O
. O
" O
And O
this O
is O
always O
the O
way O
with O
him O
, O
" O
she O
added O
. O
" O
Whatever O
can O
give O
his O
sister O
any O
pleasure O
, O
is O
sure O
to O
be O
done O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
he O
would O
not O
do O
for O
her O
. O
" O
The O
picture O
gallery O
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
of O
the O
principal O
bed-rooms O
, O
were O
all O
that O
remained O
to O
be O
shown O
. O
In O
the O
former O
were O
many O
good O
paintings O
: O
but O
Elizabeth O
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
art O
; O
and O
from O
such O
as O
had O
been O
already O
visible O
below O
, O
she O
had O
willingly O
turned O
to O
look O
at O
some O
drawings O
of O
Miss O
Darcy O
's O
, O
in O
crayons O
, O
whose O
subjects O
were O
usually O
more O
interesting O
, O
and O
also O
more O
intelligible O
. O
In O
the O
gallery O
there O
were O
many O
family O
portraits O
, O
but O
they O
could O
have O
little O
to O
fix O
the O
attention O
of O
a O
stranger O
. O
Elizabeth O
walked O
on O
in O
quest O
of O
the O
only O
face O
whose O
features O
would O
be O
known O
to O
her O
. O
At O
last O
it O
arrested O
her O
-- O
and O
she O
beheld O
a O
striking O
resemblance O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
with O
such O
a O
smile O
over O
the O
face O
, O
as O
she O
remembered O
to O
have O
sometimes O
seen O
, O
when O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
. O
She O
stood O
several O
minutes O
before O
the O
picture O
, O
in O
earnest O
contemplation O
, O
and O
returned O
to O
it O
again O
before O
they O
quitted O
the O
gallery O
. O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
informed O
them O
, O
that O
it O
had O
been O
taken O
in O
his O
father O
's O
lifetime O
. O
There O
was O
certainly O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
in O
Elizabeth O
's O
mind O
, O
a O
more O
gentle O
sensation O
towards O
the O
original O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
felt O
in O
the O
height O
of O
their O
acquaintance O
. O
The O
commendation O
bestowed O
on O
him O
by O
Mrs. O
Reynolds O
was O
of O
no O
trifling O
nature O
. O
What O
praise O
is O
more O
valuable O
than O
the O
praise O
of O
an O
intelligent O
servant O
? O
As O
a O
brother O
, O
a O
landlord O
, O
a O
master O
, O
she O
considered O
how O
many O
people O
's O
happiness O
were O
in O
his O
guardianship O
! O
How O
much O
of O
pleasure O
or O
pain O
it O
was O
in O
his O
power O
to O
bestow O
! O
How O
much O
of O
good O
or O
evil O
must O
be O
done O
by O
him O
! O
Every O
idea O
that O
had O
been O
brought O
forward O
by O
the O
housekeeper O
was O
favourable O
to O
his O
character O
; O
and O
as O
she O
stood O
before O
the O
canvas O
, O
on O
which O
he O
was O
represented O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
eyes O
upon O
herself O
, O
she O
thought O
of O
his O
regard O
with O
a O
deeper O
sentiment O
of O
gratitude O
than O
it O
had O
ever O
raised O
before O
: O
she O
remembered O
its O
warmth O
, O
and O
softened O
its O
impropriety O
of O
expression O
. O
When O
all O
of O
the O
house O
that O
was O
open O
to O
general O
inspection O
had O
been O
seen O
, O
they O
returned O
down O
stairs O
; O
and O
, O
taking O
leave O
of O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
were O
consigned O
over O
to O
the O
gardener O
, O
who O
met O
them O
at O
the O
hall O
door O
. O
As O
they O
walked O
across O
the O
lawn O
towards O
the O
river O
, O
Elizabeth O
turned O
back O
to O
look O
again O
; O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
stopped O
also O
; O
and O
while O
the O
former O
was O
conjecturing O
as O
to O
the O
date O
of O
the O
building O
, O
the O
owner O
of O
it O
himself O
suddenly O
came O
forward O
from O
the O
road O
which O
led O
behind O
it O
to O
the O
stables O
. O
They O
were O
within O
twenty O
yards O
of O
each O
other O
; O
and O
so O
abrupt O
was O
his O
appearance O
, O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
avoid O
his O
sight O
. O
Their O
eyes O
instantly O
met O
, O
and O
the O
cheeks O
of O
each O
were O
overspread O
with O
the O
deepest O
blush O
. O
He O
absolutely O
started O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
seemed O
immovable O
from O
surprise O
; O
but O
shortly O
recovering O
himself O
, O
advanced O
towards O
the O
party O
, O
and O
spoke O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
if O
not O
in O
terms O
of O
perfect O
composure O
, O
at O
least O
of O
perfect O
civility O
. O
She O
had O
instinctively O
turned O
away O
; O
but O
stopping O
on O
his O
approach O
, O
received O
his O
compliments O
with O
an O
embarrassment O
impossible O
to O
be O
overcome O
. O
Had O
his O
first O
appearance O
, O
or O
his O
resemblance O
to O
the O
picture O
they O
had O
just O
been O
examining O
, O
been O
insufficient O
to O
assure O
the O
other O
two O
that O
they O
now O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
the O
gardener O
's O
expression O
of O
surprise O
, O
on O
beholding O
his O
master O
, O
must O
immediately O
have O
told O
it O
. O
They O
stood O
a O
little O
aloof O
while O
he O
was O
talking O
to O
their O
niece O
, O
who O
, O
astonished O
and O
confused O
, O
scarcely O
dared O
lift O
her O
eyes O
to O
his O
face O
, O
and O
knew O
not O
what O
answer O
she O
returned O
to O
his O
civil O
inquiries O
after O
her O
family O
. O
Amazed O
at O
the O
alteration O
of O
his O
manner O
since O
they O
last O
parted O
, O
every O
sentence O
that O
he O
uttered O
was O
increasing O
her O
embarrassment O
; O
and O
every O
idea O
of O
the O
impropriety O
of O
her O
being O
found O
there O
recurring O
to O
her O
mind O
, O
the O
few O
minutes O
in O
which O
they O
continued O
together O
were O
some O
of O
the O
most O
uncomfortable O
of O
her O
life O
. O
Nor O
did O
he O
seem O
much O
more O
at O
ease O
; O
when O
he O
spoke O
, O
his O
accent O
had O
none O
of O
its O
usual O
sedateness O
; O
and O
he O
repeated O
his O
inquiries O
as O
to O
the O
time O
of O
her O
having O
left O
Longbourn O
, O
and O
of O
her O
stay O
in O
Derbyshire O
, O
so O
often O
, O
and O
in O
so O
hurried O
a O
way O
, O
as O
plainly O
spoke O
the O
distraction O
of O
his O
thoughts O
. O
At O
length O
, O
every O
idea O
seemed O
to O
fail O
him O
; O
and O
after O
standing O
a O
few O
moments O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
he O
suddenly O
recollected O
himself O
, O
and O
took O
leave O
. O
The O
others O
then O
joined O
her O
, O
and O
expressed O
their O
admiration O
of O
his O
figure O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
heard O
not O
a O
word O
, O
and O
, O
wholly O
engrossed O
by O
her O
own O
feelings O
, O
followed O
them O
in O
silence O
. O
She O
was O
overpowered O
by O
shame O
and O
vexation O
. O
Her O
coming O
there O
was O
the O
most O
unfortunate O
, O
the O
most O
ill-judged O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
! O
How O
strange O
must O
it O
appear O
to O
him O
! O
In O
what O
a O
disgraceful O
light O
might O
it O
not O
strike O
so O
vain O
a O
man O
! O
It O
might O
seem O
as O
if O
she O
had O
purposely O
thrown O
herself O
in O
his O
way O
again O
! O
Oh O
! O
why O
did O
she O
come O
? O
or O
, O
why O
did O
he O
thus O
come O
a O
day O
before O
he O
was O
expected O
? O
Had O
they O
been O
only O
ten O
minutes O
sooner O
, O
they O
should O
have O
been O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
his O
discrimination O
; O
for O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
he O
was O
that O
moment O
arrived O
, O
that O
moment O
alighted O
from O
his O
horse O
or O
his O
carriage O
. O
She O
blushed O
again O
and O
again O
over O
the O
perverseness O
of O
the O
meeting O
. O
And O
his O
behaviour O
, O
so O
strikingly O
altered O
, O
-- O
what O
could O
it O
mean O
? O
That O
he O
should O
even O
speak O
to O
her O
was O
amazing O
! O
-- O
but O
to O
speak O
with O
such O
civility O
, O
to O
inquire O
after O
her O
family O
! O
Never O
in O
her O
life O
had O
she O
seen O
his O
manners O
so O
little O
dignified O
, O
never O
had O
he O
spoken O
with O
such O
gentleness O
as O
on O
this O
unexpected O
meeting O
. O
What O
a O
contrast O
did O
it O
offer O
to O
his O
last O
address O
in O
Rosings O
Park O
, O
when O
he O
put O
his O
letter O
into O
her O
hand O
! O
She O
knew O
not O
what O
to O
think O
, O
or O
how O
to O
account O
for O
it O
. O
They O
had O
now O
entered O
a O
beautiful O
walk O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
water O
, O
and O
every O
step O
was O
bringing O
forward O
a O
nobler O
fall O
of O
ground O
, O
or O
a O
finer O
reach O
of O
the O
woods O
to O
which O
they O
were O
approaching O
: O
but O
it O
was O
some O
time O
before O
Elizabeth O
was O
sensible O
of O
any O
of O
it O
; O
and O
, O
though O
she O
answered O
mechanically O
to O
the O
repeated O
appeals O
of O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
direct O
her O
eyes O
to O
such O
objects O
as O
they O
pointed O
out O
, O
she O
distinguished O
no O
part O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
Her O
thoughts O
were O
all O
fixed O
on O
that O
one O
spot O
of O
Pemberley O
House O
, O
whichever O
it O
might O
be O
, O
where O
Mr. O
Darcy O
then O
was O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
know O
what O
at O
that O
moment O
was O
passing O
in O
his O
mind O
; O
in O
what O
manner O
he O
thought O
of O
her O
, O
and O
whether O
, O
in O
defiance O
of O
everything O
, O
she O
was O
still O
dear O
to O
him O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
had O
been O
civil O
only O
because O
he O
felt O
himself O
at O
ease O
; O
yet O
there O
had O
been O
_that_ O
in O
his O
voice O
, O
which O
was O
not O
like O
ease O
. O
Whether O
he O
had O
felt O
more O
of O
pain O
or O
of O
pleasure O
in O
seeing O
her O
, O
she O
could O
not O
tell O
, O
but O
he O
certainly O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
with O
composure O
. O
At O
length O
, O
however O
, O
the O
remarks O
of O
her O
companions O
on O
her O
absence O
of O
mind O
roused O
her O
, O
and O
she O
felt O
the O
necessity O
of O
appearing O
more O
like O
herself O
. O
They O
entered O
the O
woods O
, O
and O
, O
bidding O
adieu O
to O
the O
river O
for O
a O
while O
, O
ascended O
some O
of O
the O
higher O
grounds O
; O
whence O
, O
in O
spots O
where O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
trees O
gave O
the O
eye O
power O
to O
wander O
, O
were O
many O
charming O
views O
of O
the O
valley O
, O
the O
opposite O
hills O
, O
with O
the O
long O
range O
of O
woods O
overspreading O
many O
, O
and O
occasionally O
part O
of O
the O
stream O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
expressed O
a O
wish O
of O
going O
round O
the O
whole O
park O
, O
but O
feared O
it O
might O
be O
beyond O
a O
walk O
. O
With O
a O
triumphant O
smile O
, O
they O
were O
told O
, O
that O
it O
was O
ten O
miles O
round O
. O
It O
settled O
the O
matter O
; O
and O
they O
pursued O
the O
accustomed O
circuit O
; O
which O
brought O
them O
again O
, O
after O
some O
time O
, O
in O
a O
descent O
among O
hanging O
woods O
, O
to O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
water O
, O
and O
one O
of O
its O
narrowest O
parts O
. O
They O
crossed O
it O
by O
a O
simple O
bridge O
, O
in O
character O
with O
the O
general O
air O
of O
the O
scene O
: O
it O
was O
a O
spot O
less O
adorned O
than O
any O
they O
had O
yet O
visited O
; O
and O
the O
valley O
, O
here O
contracted O
into O
a O
glen O
, O
allowed O
room O
only O
for O
the O
stream O
, O
and O
a O
narrow O
walk O
amidst O
the O
rough O
coppice-wood O
which O
bordered O
it O
. O
Elizabeth O
longed O
to O
explore O
its O
windings O
; O
but O
when O
they O
had O
crossed O
the O
bridge O
, O
and O
perceived O
their O
distance O
from O
the O
house O
, O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
who O
was O
not O
a O
great O
walker O
, O
could O
go O
no O
farther O
, O
and O
thought O
only O
of O
returning O
to O
the O
carriage O
as O
quickly O
as O
possible O
. O
Her O
niece O
was O
, O
therefore O
, O
obliged O
to O
submit O
, O
and O
they O
took O
their O
way O
towards O
the O
house O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
the O
river O
, O
in O
the O
nearest O
direction O
; O
but O
their O
progress O
was O
slow O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
though O
seldom O
able O
to O
indulge O
the O
taste O
, O
was O
very O
fond O
of O
fishing O
, O
and O
was O
so O
much O
engaged O
in O
watching O
the O
occasional O
appearance O
of O
some O
trout O
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
talking O
to O
the O
man O
about O
them O
, O
that O
he O
advanced O
but O
little O
. O
Whilst O
wandering O
on O
in O
this O
slow O
manner O
, O
they O
were O
again O
surprised O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
's O
astonishment O
was O
quite O
equal O
to O
what O
it O
had O
been O
at O
first O
, O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
approaching O
them O
, O
and O
at O
no O
great O
distance O
. O
The O
walk O
being O
here O
less O
sheltered O
than O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
allowed O
them O
to O
see O
him O
before O
they O
met O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
however O
astonished O
, O
was O
at O
least O
more O
prepared O
for O
an O
interview O
than O
before O
, O
and O
resolved O
to O
appear O
and O
to O
speak O
with O
calmness O
, O
if O
he O
really O
intended O
to O
meet O
them O
. O
For O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
indeed O
, O
she O
felt O
that O
he O
would O
probably O
strike O
into O
some O
other O
path O
. O
The O
idea O
lasted O
while O
a O
turning O
in O
the O
walk O
concealed O
him O
from O
their O
view O
; O
the O
turning O
past O
, O
he O
was O
immediately O
before O
them O
. O
With O
a O
glance O
she O
saw O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
none O
of O
his O
recent O
civility O
; O
and O
, O
to O
imitate O
his O
politeness O
, O
she O
began O
as O
they O
met O
to O
admire O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
place O
; O
but O
she O
had O
not O
got O
beyond O
the O
words O
" O
delightful O
, O
" O
and O
" O
charming O
, O
" O
when O
some O
unlucky O
recollections O
obtruded O
, O
and O
she O
fancied O
that O
praise O
of O
Pemberley O
from O
her O
might O
be O
mischievously O
construed O
. O
Her O
colour O
changed O
, O
and O
she O
said O
no O
more O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
was O
standing O
a O
little O
behind O
; O
and O
on O
her O
pausing O
, O
he O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
would O
do O
him O
the O
honour O
of O
introducing O
him O
to O
her O
friends O
. O
This O
was O
a O
stroke O
of O
civility O
for O
which O
she O
was O
quite O
unprepared O
; O
and O
she O
could O
hardly O
suppress O
a O
smile O
at O
his O
being O
now O
seeking O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
some O
of O
those O
very O
people O
, O
against O
whom O
his O
pride O
had O
revolted O
, O
in O
his O
offer O
to O
herself O
. O
" O
What O
will O
be O
his O
surprise O
, O
" O
thought O
she O
, O
" O
when O
he O
knows O
who O
they O
are O
! O
He O
takes O
them O
now O
for O
people O
of O
fashion O
. O
" O
The O
introduction O
, O
however O
, O
was O
immediately O
made O
; O
and O
as O
she O
named O
their O
relationship O
to O
herself O
, O
she O
stole O
a O
sly O
look O
at O
him O
, O
to O
see O
how O
he O
bore O
it O
; O
and O
was O
not O
without O
the O
expectation O
of O
his O
decamping O
as O
fast O
as O
he O
could O
from O
such O
disgraceful O
companions O
. O
That O
he O
was O
_surprised_ O
by O
the O
connection O
was O
evident O
: O
he O
sustained O
it O
, O
however O
, O
with O
fortitude O
: O
and O
, O
so O
far O
from O
going O
away O
, O
turned O
back O
with O
them O
, O
and O
entered O
into O
conversation O
with O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
. O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
but O
be O
pleased O
, O
could O
not O
but O
triumph O
. O
It O
was O
consoling O
that O
he O
should O
know O
she O
had O
some O
relations O
for O
whom O
there O
was O
no O
need O
to O
blush O
. O
She O
listened O
most O
attentively O
to O
all O
that O
passed O
between O
them O
, O
and O
gloried O
in O
every O
expression O
, O
every O
sentence O
of O
her O
uncle O
, O
which O
marked O
his O
intelligence O
, O
his O
taste O
, O
or O
his O
good O
manners O
. O
The O
conversation O
soon O
turned O
upon O
fishing O
; O
and O
she O
heard O
Mr. O
Darcy O
invite O
him O
, O
with O
the O
greatest O
civility O
, O
to O
fish O
there O
as O
often O
as O
he O
chose O
, O
while O
he O
continued O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
offering O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
supply O
him O
with O
fishing O
tackle O
, O
and O
pointing O
out O
those O
parts O
of O
the O
stream O
where O
there O
was O
usually O
most O
sport O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
who O
was O
walking O
arm O
in O
arm O
with O
Elizabeth O
, O
gave O
her O
a O
look O
expressive O
of O
her O
wonder O
. O
Elizabeth O
said O
nothing O
, O
but O
it O
gratified O
her O
exceedingly O
; O
the O
compliment O
must O
be O
all O
for O
herself O
. O
Her O
astonishment O
, O
however O
, O
was O
extreme O
; O
and O
continually O
was O
she O
repeating O
, O
" O
Why O
is O
he O
so O
altered O
? O
From O
what O
can O
it O
proceed O
? O
It O
can O
not O
be O
for O
_me_ O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
for O
_my_ O
sake O
that O
his O
manners O
are O
thus O
softened O
. O
My O
reproofs O
at O
Hunsford O
could O
not O
work O
such O
a O
change O
as O
this O
. O
It O
is O
impossible O
that O
he O
should O
still O
love O
me O
. O
" O
After O
walking O
some O
time O
in O
this O
way O
, O
the O
two O
ladies O
in O
front O
, O
the O
two O
gentlemen O
behind O
, O
on O
resuming O
their O
places O
, O
after O
descending O
to O
the O
brink O
of O
the O
river O
for O
the O
better O
inspection O
of O
some O
curious O
water-plant O
, O
there O
chanced O
to O
be O
a O
little O
alteration O
. O
It O
originated O
in O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
who O
, O
fatigued O
by O
the O
exercise O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
found O
Elizabeth O
's O
arm O
inadequate O
to O
her O
support O
, O
and O
consequently O
preferred O
her O
husband O
's O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
took O
her O
place O
by O
her O
niece O
, O
and O
they O
walked O
on O
together O
. O
After O
a O
short O
silence O
the O
lady O
first O
spoke O
. O
She O
wished O
him O
to O
know O
that O
she O
had O
been O
assured O
of O
his O
absence O
before O
she O
came O
to O
the O
place O
, O
and O
accordingly O
began O
by O
observing O
, O
that O
his O
arrival O
had O
been O
very O
unexpected O
-- O
" O
for O
your O
housekeeper O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
informed O
us O
that O
you O
would O
certainly O
not O
be O
here O
till O
to-morrow O
; O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
before O
we O
left O
Bakewell O
, O
we O
understood O
that O
you O
were O
not O
immediately O
expected O
in O
the O
country O
. O
" O
He O
acknowledged O
the O
truth O
of O
it O
all O
; O
and O
said O
that O
business O
with O
his O
steward O
had O
occasioned O
his O
coming O
forward O
a O
few O
hours O
before O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
party O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
travelling O
. O
" O
They O
will O
join O
me O
early O
to-morrow O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
and O
among O
them O
are O
some O
who O
will O
claim O
an O
acquaintance O
with O
you O
, O
-- O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
his O
sisters O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
answered O
only O
by O
a O
slight O
bow O
. O
Her O
thoughts O
were O
instantly O
driven O
back O
to O
the O
time O
when O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
name O
had O
been O
last O
mentioned O
between O
them O
; O
and O
if O
she O
might O
judge O
from O
his O
complexion O
, O
_his_ O
mind O
was O
not O
very O
differently O
engaged O
. O
" O
There O
is O
also O
one O
other O
person O
in O
the O
party O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
" O
who O
more O
particularly O
wishes O
to O
be O
known O
to O
you O
. O
Will O
you O
allow O
me O
, O
or O
do O
I O
ask O
too O
much O
, O
to O
introduce O
my O
sister O
to O
your O
acquaintance O
during O
your O
stay O
at O
Lambton O
? O
" O
The O
surprise O
of O
such O
an O
application O
was O
great O
indeed O
; O
it O
was O
too O
great O
for O
her O
to O
know O
in O
what O
manner O
she O
acceded O
to O
it O
. O
She O
immediately O
felt O
that O
whatever O
desire O
Miss O
Darcy O
might O
have O
of O
being O
acquainted O
with O
her O
, O
must O
be O
the O
work O
of O
her O
brother O
, O
and O
without O
looking O
farther O
, O
it O
was O
satisfactory O
; O
it O
was O
gratifying O
to O
know O
that O
his O
resentment O
had O
not O
made O
him O
think O
really O
ill O
of O
her O
. O
They O
now O
walked O
on O
in O
silence O
; O
each O
of O
them O
deep O
in O
thought O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
not O
comfortable O
; O
that O
was O
impossible O
; O
but O
she O
was O
flattered O
and O
pleased O
. O
His O
wish O
of O
introducing O
his O
sister O
to O
her O
was O
a O
compliment O
of O
the O
highest O
kind O
. O
They O
soon O
outstripped O
the O
others O
; O
and O
when O
they O
had O
reached O
the O
carriage O
, O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
were O
half O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
behind O
. O
He O
then O
asked O
her O
to O
walk O
into O
the O
house O
-- O
but O
she O
declared O
herself O
not O
tired O
, O
and O
they O
stood O
together O
on O
the O
lawn O
. O
At O
such O
a O
time O
much O
might O
have O
been O
said O
, O
and O
silence O
was O
very O
awkward O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
talk O
, O
but O
there O
seemed O
an O
embargo O
on O
every O
subject O
. O
At O
last O
she O
recollected O
that O
she O
had O
been O
travelling O
, O
and O
they O
talked O
of O
Matlock O
and O
Dovedale O
with O
great O
perseverance O
. O
Yet O
time O
and O
her O
aunt O
moved O
slowly O
-- O
and O
her O
patience O
and O
her O
ideas O
were O
nearly O
worn O
out O
before O
the O
_tête-à-tête_ O
was O
over O
. O
On O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
's O
coming O
up O
they O
were O
all O
pressed O
to O
go O
into O
the O
house O
and O
take O
some O
refreshment O
; O
but O
this O
was O
declined O
, O
and O
they O
parted O
on O
each O
side O
with O
the O
utmost O
politeness O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
handed O
the O
ladies O
into O
the O
carriage O
; O
and O
when O
it O
drove O
off O
, O
Elizabeth O
saw O
him O
walking O
slowly O
towards O
the O
house O
. O
The O
observations O
of O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
now O
began O
; O
and O
each O
of O
them O
pronounced O
him O
to O
be O
infinitely O
superior O
to O
anything O
they O
had O
expected O
. O
" O
He O
is O
perfectly O
well-behaved O
, O
polite O
, O
and O
unassuming O
, O
" O
said O
her O
uncle O
. O
" O
There O
_is_ O
something O
a O
little O
stately O
in O
him O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
aunt O
; O
" O
but O
it O
is O
confined O
to O
his O
air O
, O
and O
is O
not O
unbecoming O
. O
I O
can O
now O
say O
with O
the O
housekeeper O
, O
that O
though O
some O
people O
may O
call O
him O
proud O
, O
_I_ O
have O
seen O
nothing O
of O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
was O
never O
more O
surprised O
than O
by O
his O
behaviour O
to O
us O
. O
It O
was O
more O
than O
civil O
; O
it O
was O
really O
attentive O
; O
and O
there O
was O
no O
necessity O
for O
such O
attention O
. O
His O
acquaintance O
with O
Elizabeth O
was O
very O
trifling O
. O
" O
" O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
her O
aunt O
, O
" O
he O
is O
not O
so O
handsome O
as O
Wickham O
; O
or O
rather O
he O
has O
not O
Wickham O
's O
countenance O
, O
for O
his O
features O
are O
perfectly O
good O
. O
But O
how O
came O
you O
to O
tell O
us O
that O
he O
was O
so O
disagreeable O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
excused O
herself O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
: O
said O
that O
she O
had O
liked O
him O
better O
when O
they O
met O
in O
Kent O
than O
before O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
never O
seen O
him O
so O
pleasant O
as O
this O
morning O
. O
" O
But O
perhaps O
he O
may O
be O
a O
little O
whimsical O
in O
his O
civilities O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
uncle O
. O
" O
Your O
great O
men O
often O
are O
; O
and O
therefore O
I O
shall O
not O
take O
him O
at O
his O
word O
about O
fishing O
, O
as O
he O
might O
change O
his O
mind O
another O
day O
, O
and O
warn O
me O
off O
his O
grounds O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
felt O
that O
they O
had O
entirely O
mistaken O
his O
character O
, O
but O
said O
nothing O
. O
" O
From O
what O
we O
have O
seen O
of O
him O
, O
" O
continued O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
" O
I O
really O
should O
not O
have O
thought O
that O
he O
could O
have O
behaved O
in O
so O
cruel O
a O
way O
by O
anybody O
as O
he O
has O
done O
by O
poor O
Wickham O
. O
He O
has O
not O
an O
ill-natured O
look O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
there O
is O
something O
pleasing O
about O
his O
mouth O
when O
he O
speaks O
. O
And O
there O
is O
something O
of O
dignity O
in O
his O
countenance O
, O
that O
would O
not O
give O
one O
an O
unfavourable O
idea O
of O
his O
heart O
. O
But O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
the O
good O
lady O
who O
showed O
us O
the O
house O
did O
give O
him O
a O
most O
flaming O
character O
! O
I O
could O
hardly O
help O
laughing O
aloud O
sometimes O
. O
But O
he O
is O
a O
liberal O
master O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
and O
_that_ O
, O
in O
the O
eye O
of O
a O
servant O
, O
comprehends O
every O
virtue O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
here O
felt O
herself O
called O
on O
to O
say O
something O
in O
vindication O
of O
his O
behaviour O
to O
Wickham O
; O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
gave O
them O
to O
understand O
, O
in O
as O
guarded O
a O
manner O
as O
she O
could O
, O
that O
by O
what O
she O
had O
heard O
from O
his O
relations O
in O
Kent O
, O
his O
actions O
were O
capable O
of O
a O
very O
different O
construction O
; O
and O
that O
his O
character O
was O
by O
no O
means O
so O
faulty O
, O
nor O
Wickham O
's O
so O
amiable O
, O
as O
they O
had O
been O
considered O
in O
Hertfordshire O
. O
In O
confirmation O
of O
this O
, O
she O
related O
the O
particulars O
of O
all O
the O
pecuniary O
transactions O
in O
which O
they O
had O
been O
connected O
, O
without O
actually O
naming O
her O
authority O
, O
but O
stating O
it O
to O
be O
such O
as O
might O
be O
relied O
on O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
was O
surprised O
and O
concerned O
: O
but O
as O
they O
were O
now O
approaching O
the O
scene O
of O
her O
former O
pleasures O
, O
every O
idea O
gave O
way O
to O
the O
charm O
of O
recollection O
; O
and O
she O
was O
too O
much O
engaged O
in O
pointing O
out O
to O
her O
husband O
all O
the O
interesting O
spots O
in O
its O
environs O
, O
to O
think O
of O
anything O
else O
. O
Fatigued O
as O
she O
had O
been O
by O
the O
morning O
's O
walk O
, O
they O
had O
no O
sooner O
dined O
than O
she O
set O
off O
again O
in O
quest O
of O
her O
former O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
the O
evening O
was O
spent O
in O
the O
satisfactions O
of O
an O
intercourse O
renewed O
after O
many O
years O
' O
discontinuance O
. O
The O
occurrences O
of O
the O
day O
were O
too O
full O
of O
interest O
to O
leave O
Elizabeth O
much O
attention O
for O
any O
of O
these O
new O
friends O
; O
and O
she O
could O
do O
nothing O
but O
think O
, O
and O
think O
with O
wonder O
, O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
civility O
, O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
of O
his O
wishing O
her O
to O
be O
acquainted O
with O
his O
sister O
