Every O
object O
in O
the O
next O
day O
's O
journey O
was O
new O
and O
interesting O
to O
Elizabeth O
; O
and O
her O
spirits O
were O
in O
a O
state O
of O
enjoyment O
; O
for O
she O
had O
seen O
her O
sister O
looking O
so O
well O
as O
to O
banish O
all O
fear O
for O
her O
health O
, O
and O
the O
prospect O
of O
her O
northern O
tour O
was O
a O
constant O
source O
of O
delight O
. O
When O
they O
left O
the O
high O
road O
for O
the O
lane O
to O
Hunsford O
, O
every O
eye O
was O
in O
search O
of O
the O
Parsonage O
, O
and O
every O
turning O
expected O
to O
bring O
it O
in O
view O
. O
The O
paling O
of O
Rosings O
park O
was O
their O
boundary O
on O
one O
side O
. O
Elizabeth O
smiled O
at O
the O
recollection O
of O
all O
that O
she O
had O
heard O
of O
its O
inhabitants O
. O
At O
length O
the O
Parsonage O
was O
discernible O
. O
The O
garden O
sloping O
to O
the O
road O
, O
the O
house O
standing O
in O
it O
, O
the O
green O
pales O
and O
the O
laurel O
hedge O
, O
everything O
declared O
they O
were O
arriving O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
and O
Charlotte O
appeared O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
the O
carriage O
stopped O
at O
the O
small O
gate O
, O
which O
led O
by O
a O
short O
gravel O
walk O
to O
the O
house O
, O
amidst O
the O
nods O
and O
smiles O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
they O
were O
all O
out O
of O
the O
chaise O
, O
rejoicing O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
each O
other O
. O
Mrs. O
Collins O
welcomed O
her O
friend O
with O
the O
liveliest O
pleasure O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
more O
and O
more O
satisfied O
with O
coming O
, O
when O
she O
found O
herself O
so O
affectionately O
received O
. O
She O
saw O
instantly O
that O
her O
cousin O
's O
manners O
were O
not O
altered O
by O
his O
marriage O
: O
his O
formal O
civility O
was O
just O
what O
it O
had O
been O
; O
and O
he O
detained O
her O
some O
minutes O
at O
the O
gate O
to O
hear O
and O
satisfy O
his O
inquiries O
after O
all O
her O
family O
. O
They O
were O
then O
, O
with O
no O
other O
delay O
than O
his O
pointing O
out O
the O
neatness O
of O
the O
entrance O
, O
taken O
into O
the O
house O
; O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
in O
the O
parlour O
, O
he O
welcomed O
them O
a O
second O
time O
, O
with O
ostentatious O
formality O
, O
to O
his O
humble O
abode O
, O
and O
punctually O
repeated O
all O
his O
wife O
's O
offers O
of O
refreshment O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
prepared O
to O
see O
him O
in O
his O
glory O
; O
and O
she O
could O
not O
help O
fancying O
that O
in O
displaying O
the O
good O
proportion O
of O
the O
room O
, O
its O
aspect O
, O
and O
its O
furniture O
, O
he O
addressed O
himself O
particularly O
to O
her O
, O
as O
if O
wishing O
to O
make O
her O
feel O
what O
she O
had O
lost O
in O
refusing O
him O
. O
But O
though O
everything O
seemed O
neat O
and O
comfortable O
, O
she O
was O
not O
able O
to O
gratify O
him O
by O
any O
sigh O
of O
repentance O
; O
and O
rather O
looked O
with O
wonder O
at O
her O
friend O
, O
that O
she O
could O
have O
so O
cheerful O
an O
air O
with O
such O
a O
companion O
. O
When O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
said O
anything O
of O
which O
his O
wife O
might O
reasonably O
be O
ashamed O
, O
which O
certainly O
was O
not O
seldom O
, O
she O
involuntarily O
turned O
her O
eye O
on O
Charlotte O
. O
Once O
or O
twice O
she O
could O
discern O
a O
faint O
blush O
; O
but O
in O
general O
Charlotte O
wisely O
did O
not O
hear O
. O
After O
sitting O
long O
enough O
to O
admire O
every O
article O
of O
furniture O
in O
the O
room O
, O
from O
the O
sideboard O
to O
the O
fender O
, O
to O
give O
an O
account O
of O
their O
journey O
, O
and O
of O
all O
that O
had O
happened O
in O
London O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
invited O
them O
to O
take O
a O
stroll O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
which O
was O
large O
and O
well O
laid O
out O
, O
and O
to O
the O
cultivation O
of O
which O
he O
attended O
himself O
. O
To O
work O
in O
his O
garden O
was O
one O
of O
his O
most O
respectable O
pleasures O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
admired O
the O
command O
of O
countenance O
with O
which O
Charlotte O
talked O
of O
the O
healthfulness O
of O
the O
exercise O
, O
and O
owned O
she O
encouraged O
it O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O
Here O
, O
leading O
the O
way O
through O
every O
walk O
and O
cross O
walk O
, O
and O
scarcely O
allowing O
them O
an O
interval O
to O
utter O
the O
praises O
he O
asked O
for O
, O
every O
view O
was O
pointed O
out O
with O
a O
minuteness O
which O
left O
beauty O
entirely O
behind O
. O
He O
could O
number O
the O
fields O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
and O
could O
tell O
how O
many O
trees O
there O
were O
in O
the O
most O
distant O
clump O
. O
But O
of O
all O
the O
views O
which O
his O
garden O
, O
or O
which O
the O
country O
or O
the O
kingdom O
could O
boast O
, O
none O
were O
to O
be O
compared O
with O
the O
prospect O
of O
Rosings O
, O
afforded O
by O
an O
opening O
in O
the O
trees O
that O
bordered O
the O
park O
nearly O
opposite O
the O
front O
of O
his O
house O
. O
It O
was O
a O
handsome O
modern O
building O
, O
well O
situated O
on O
rising O
ground O
. O
From O
his O
garden O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
would O
have O
led O
them O
round O
his O
two O
meadows O
; O
but O
the O
ladies O
, O
not O
having O
shoes O
to O
encounter O
the O
remains O
of O
a O
white O
frost O
, O
turned O
back O
; O
and O
while O
Sir O
William O
accompanied O
him O
, O
Charlotte O
took O
her O
sister O
and O
friend O
over O
the O
house O
, O
extremely O
well O
pleased O
, O
probably O
, O
to O
have O
the O
opportunity O
of O
showing O
it O
without O
her O
husband O
's O
help O
. O
It O
was O
rather O
small O
, O
but O
well O
built O
and O
convenient O
; O
and O
everything O
was O
fitted O
up O
and O
arranged O
with O
a O
neatness O
and O
consistency O
, O
of O
which O
Elizabeth O
gave O
Charlotte O
all O
the O
credit O
. O
When O
Mr. O
Collins O
could O
be O
forgotten O
, O
there O
was O
really O
a O
great O
air O
of O
comfort O
throughout O
, O
and O
by O
Charlotte O
's O
evident O
enjoyment O
of O
it O
, O
Elizabeth O
supposed O
he O
must O
be O
often O
forgotten O
. O
She O
had O
already O
learnt O
that O
Lady O
Catherine O
was O
still O
in O
the O
country O
. O
It O
was O
spoken O
of O
again O
while O
they O
were O
at O
dinner O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Collins O
joining O
in O
, O
observed O
, O
-- O
" O
Yes O
, O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
, O
you O
will O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
seeing O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
on O
the O
ensuing O
Sunday O
at O
church O
, O
and O
I O
need O
not O
say O
you O
will O
be O
delighted O
with O
her O
. O
She O
is O
all O
affability O
and O
condescension O
, O
and O
I O
doubt O
not O
but O
you O
will O
be O
honoured O
with O
some O
portion O
of O
her O
notice O
when O
service O
is O
over O
. O
I O
have O
scarcely O
any O
hesitation O
in O
saying O
that O
she O
will O
include O
you O
and O
my O
sister O
Maria O
in O
every O
invitation O
with O
which O
she O
honours O
us O
during O
your O
stay O
here O
. O
Her O
behaviour O
to O
my O
dear O
Charlotte O
is O
charming O
. O
We O
dine O
at O
Rosings O
twice O
every O
week O
, O
and O
are O
never O
allowed O
to O
walk O
home O
. O
Her O
Ladyship O
's O
carriage O
is O
regularly O
ordered O
for O
us O
. O
I O
_should_ O
say O
, O
one O
of O
her O
Ladyship O
's O
carriages O
, O
for O
she O
has O
several O
. O
" O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
is O
a O
very O
respectable O
, O
sensible O
woman O
, O
indeed O
, O
" O
added O
Charlotte O
, O
" O
and O
a O
most O
attentive O
neighbour O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
true O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
say O
. O
She O
is O
the O
sort O
of O
woman O
whom O
one O
can O
not O
regard O
with O
too O
much O
deference O
. O
" O
The O
evening O
was O
spent O
chiefly O
in O
talking O
over O
Hertfordshire O
news O
, O
and O
telling O
again O
what O
had O
been O
already O
written O
; O
and O
when O
it O
closed O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
in O
the O
solitude O
of O
her O
chamber O
, O
had O
to O
meditate O
upon O
Charlotte O
's O
degree O
of O
contentment O
, O
to O
understand O
her O
address O
in O
guiding O
, O
and O
composure O
in O
bearing O
with O
, O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
it O
was O
all O
done O
very O
well O
. O
She O
had O
also O
to O
anticipate O
how O
her O
visit O
would O
pass O
, O
the O
quiet O
tenour O
of O
their O
usual O
employments O
, O
the O
vexatious O
interruptions O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
and O
the O
gaieties O
of O
their O
intercourse O
with O
Rosings O
. O
A O
lively O
imagination O
soon O
settled O
it O
all O
. O
About O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
next O
day O
, O
as O
she O
was O
in O
her O
room O
getting O
ready O
for O
a O
walk O
, O
a O
sudden O
noise O
below O
seemed O
to O
speak O
the O
whole O
house O
in O
confusion O
; O
and O
, O
after O
listening O
a O
moment O
, O
she O
heard O
somebody O
running O
upstairs O
in O
a O
violent O
hurry O
, O
and O
calling O
loudly O
after O
her O
. O
She O
opened O
the O
door O
, O
and O
met O
Maria O
in O
the O
landing-place O
, O
who O
, O
breathless O
with O
agitation O
, O
cried O
out O
, O
-- O
" O
Oh O
, O
my O
dear O
Eliza O
! O
pray O
make O
haste O
and O
come O
into O
the O
dining-room O
, O
for O
there O
is O
such O
a O
sight O
to O
be O
seen O
! O
I O
will O
not O
tell O
you O
what O
it O
is O
. O
Make O
haste O
, O
and O
come O
down O
this O
moment O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
asked O
questions O
in O
vain O
; O
Maria O
would O
tell O
her O
nothing O
more O
; O
and O
down O
they O
ran O
into O
the O
dining-room O
which O
fronted O
the O
lane O
, O
in O
quest O
of O
this O
wonder O
; O
it O
was O
two O
ladies O
, O
stopping O
in O
a O
low O
phaeton O
at O
the O
garden O
gate O
. O
" O
And O
is O
this O
all O
? O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
I O
expected O
at O
least O
that O
the O
pigs O
were O
got O
into O
the O
garden O
, O
and O
here O
is O
nothing O
but O
Lady O
Catherine O
and O
her O
daughter O
! O
" O
" O
La O
! O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Maria O
, O
quite O
shocked O
at O
the O
mistake O
, O
" O
it O
is O
not O
Lady O
Catherine O
. O
The O
old O
lady O
is O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
, O
who O
lives O
with O
them O
. O
The O
other O
is O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
. O
Only O
look O
at O
her O
. O
She O
is O
quite O
a O
little O
creature O
. O
Who O
would O
have O
thought O
she O
could O
be O
so O
thin O
and O
small O
! O
" O
" O
She O
is O
abominably O
rude O
to O
keep O
Charlotte O
out O
of O
doors O
in O
all O
this O
wind O
. O
Why O
does O
she O
not O
come O
in O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
Charlotte O
says O
she O
hardly O
ever O
does O
. O
It O
is O
the O
greatest O
of O
favours O
when O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
comes O
in O
. O
" O
" O
I O
like O
her O
appearance O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
struck O
with O
other O
ideas O
. O
" O
She O
looks O
sickly O
and O
cross O
. O
Yes O
, O
she O
will O
do O
for O
him O
very O
well O
. O
She O
will O
make O
him O
a O
very O
proper O
wife O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Collins O
and O
Charlotte O
were O
both O
standing O
at O
the O
gate O
in O
conversation O
with O
the O
ladies O
; O
and O
Sir O
William O
, O
to O
Elizabeth O
's O
high O
diversion O
, O
was O
stationed O
in O
the O
doorway O
, O
in O
earnest O
contemplation O
of O
the O
greatness O
before O
him O
, O
and O
constantly O
bowing O
whenever O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
looked O
that O
way O
. O
At O
length O
there O
was O
nothing O
more O
to O
be O
said O
; O
the O
ladies O
drove O
on O
, O
and O
the O
others O
returned O
into O
the O
house O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
no O
sooner O
saw O
the O
two O
girls O
than O
he O
began O
to O
congratulate O
them O
on O
their O
good O
fortune O
, O
which O
Charlotte O
explained O
by O
letting O
them O
know O
that O
the O
whole O
party O
was O
asked O
to O
dine O
at O
Rosings O
the O
next O
day O
. O
