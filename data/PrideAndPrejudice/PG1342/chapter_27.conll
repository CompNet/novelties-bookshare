With O
no O
greater O
events O
than O
these O
in O
the O
Longbourn O
family O
, O
and O
otherwise O
diversified O
by O
little O
beyond O
the O
walks O
to O
Meryton O
, O
sometimes O
dirty O
and O
sometimes O
cold O
, O
did O
January O
and O
February O
pass O
away O
. O
March O
was O
to O
take O
Elizabeth O
to O
Hunsford O
. O
She O
had O
not O
at O
first O
thought O
very O
seriously O
of O
going O
thither O
; O
but O
Charlotte O
, O
she O
soon O
found O
, O
was O
depending O
on O
the O
plan O
, O
and O
she O
gradually O
learned O
to O
consider O
it O
herself O
with O
greater O
pleasure O
as O
well O
as O
greater O
certainty O
. O
Absence O
had O
increased O
her O
desire O
of O
seeing O
Charlotte O
again O
, O
and O
weakened O
her O
disgust O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
. O
There O
was O
novelty O
in O
the O
scheme O
; O
and O
as O
, O
with O
such O
a O
mother O
and O
such O
uncompanionable O
sisters O
, O
home O
could O
not O
be O
faultless O
, O
a O
little O
change O
was O
not O
unwelcome O
for O
its O
own O
sake O
. O
The O
journey O
would O
, O
moreover O
, O
give O
her O
a O
peep O
at O
Jane O
; O
and O
, O
in O
short O
, O
as O
the O
time O
drew O
near O
, O
she O
would O
have O
been O
very O
sorry O
for O
any O
delay O
. O
Everything O
, O
however O
, O
went O
on O
smoothly O
, O
and O
was O
finally O
settled O
according O
to O
Charlotte O
's O
first O
sketch O
. O
She O
was O
to O
accompany O
Sir O
William O
and O
his O
second O
daughter O
. O
The O
improvement O
of O
spending O
a O
night O
in O
London O
was O
added O
in O
time O
, O
and O
the O
plan O
became O
as O
perfect O
as O
plan O
could O
be O
. O
The O
only O
pain O
was O
in O
leaving O
her O
father O
, O
who O
would O
certainly O
miss O
her O
, O
and O
who O
, O
when O
it O
came O
to O
the O
point O
, O
so O
little O
liked O
her O
going O
, O
that O
he O
told O
her O
to O
write O
to O
him O
, O
and O
almost O
promised O
to O
answer O
her O
letter O
. O
The O
farewell O
between O
herself O
and O
Mr. O
Wickham O
was O
perfectly O
friendly O
; O
on O
his O
side O
even O
more O
. O
His O
present O
pursuit O
could O
not O
make O
him O
forget O
that O
Elizabeth O
had O
been O
the O
first O
to O
excite O
and O
to O
deserve O
his O
attention O
, O
the O
first O
to O
listen O
and O
to O
pity O
, O
the O
first O
to O
be O
admired O
; O
and O
in O
his O
manner O
of O
bidding O
her O
adieu O
, O
wishing O
her O
every O
enjoyment O
, O
reminding O
her O
of O
what O
she O
was O
to O
expect O
in O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
and O
trusting O
their O
opinion O
of O
her O
-- O
their O
opinion O
of O
everybody O
-- O
would O
always O
coincide O
, O
there O
was O
a O
solicitude O
, O
an O
interest O
, O
which O
she O
felt O
must O
ever O
attach O
her O
to O
him O
with O
a O
most O
sincere O
regard O
; O
and O
she O
parted O
from O
him O
convinced O
, O
that O
, O
whether O
married O
or O
single O
, O
he O
must O
always O
be O
her O
model O
of O
the O
amiable O
and O
pleasing O
. O
Her O
fellow-travellers O
the O
next O
day O
were O
not O
of O
a O
kind O
to O
make O
her O
think O
him O
less O
agreeable O
. O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
, O
and O
his O
daughter O
Maria O
, O
a O
good-humoured O
girl O
, O
but O
as O
empty-headed O
as O
himself O
, O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
that O
could O
be O
worth O
hearing O
, O
and O
were O
listened O
to O
with O
about O
as O
much O
delight O
as O
the O
rattle O
of O
the O
chaise O
. O
Elizabeth O
loved O
absurdities O
, O
but O
she O
had O
known O
Sir O
William O
's O
too O
long O
. O
He O
could O
tell O
her O
nothing O
new O
of O
the O
wonders O
of O
his O
presentation O
and O
knighthood O
; O
and O
his O
civilities O
were O
worn O
out O
, O
like O
his O
information O
. O
It O
was O
a O
journey O
of O
only O
twenty-four O
miles O
, O
and O
they O
began O
it O
so O
early O
as O
to O
be O
in O
Gracechurch O
Street O
by O
noon O
. O
As O
they O
drove O
to O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
's O
door O
, O
Jane O
was O
at O
a O
drawing-room O
window O
watching O
their O
arrival O
: O
when O
they O
entered O
the O
passage O
, O
she O
was O
there O
to O
welcome O
them O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
looking O
earnestly O
in O
her O
face O
, O
was O
pleased O
to O
see O
it O
healthful O
and O
lovely O
as O
ever O
. O
On O
the O
stairs O
were O
a O
troop O
of O
little O
boys O
and O
girls O
, O
whose O
eagerness O
for O
their O
cousin O
's O
appearance O
would O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
wait O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
and O
whose O
shyness O
, O
as O
they O
had O
not O
seen O
her O
for O
a O
twelvemonth O
, O
prevented O
their O
coming O
lower O
. O
All O
was O
joy O
and O
kindness O
. O
The O
day O
passed O
most O
pleasantly O
away O
; O
the O
morning O
in O
bustle O
and O
shopping O
, O
and O
the O
evening O
at O
one O
of O
the O
theatres O
. O
Elizabeth O
then O
contrived O
to O
sit O
by O
her O
aunt O
. O
Their O
first O
subject O
was O
her O
sister O
; O
and O
she O
was O
more O
grieved O
than O
astonished O
to O
hear O
, O
in O
reply O
to O
her O
minute O
inquiries O
, O
that O
though O
Jane O
always O
struggled O
to O
support O
her O
spirits O
, O
there O
were O
periods O
of O
dejection O
. O
It O
was O
reasonable O
, O
however O
, O
to O
hope O
that O
they O
would O
not O
continue O
long O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
gave O
her O
the O
particulars O
also O
of O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
visit O
in O
Gracechurch O
Street O
, O
and O
repeated O
conversations O
occurring O
at O
different O
times O
between O
Jane O
and O
herself O
, O
which O
proved O
that O
the O
former O
had O
, O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
given O
up O
the O
acquaintance O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
then O
rallied O
her O
niece O
on O
Wickham O
's O
desertion O
, O
and O
complimented O
her O
on O
bearing O
it O
so O
well O
. O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
what O
sort O
of O
girl O
is O
Miss O
King O
? O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
to O
think O
our O
friend O
mercenary O
. O
" O
" O
Pray O
, O
my O
dear O
aunt O
, O
what O
is O
the O
difference O
in O
matrimonial O
affairs O
, O
between O
the O
mercenary O
and O
the O
prudent O
motive O
? O
Where O
does O
discretion O
end O
, O
and O
avarice O
begin O
? O
Last O
Christmas O
you O
were O
afraid O
of O
his O
marrying O
me O
, O
because O
it O
would O
be O
imprudent O
; O
and O
now O
, O
because O
he O
is O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
girl O
with O
only O
ten O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
you O
want O
to O
find O
out O
that O
he O
is O
mercenary O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
will O
only O
tell O
me O
what O
sort O
of O
girl O
Miss O
King O
is O
, O
I O
shall O
know O
what O
to O
think O
. O
" O
" O
She O
is O
a O
very O
good O
kind O
of O
girl O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
I O
know O
no O
harm O
of O
her O
. O
" O
" O
But O
he O
paid O
her O
not O
the O
smallest O
attention O
till O
her O
grandfather O
's O
death O
made O
her O
mistress O
of O
this O
fortune O
? O
" O
" O
No O
-- O
why O
should O
he O
? O
If O
it O
were O
not O
allowable O
for O
him O
to O
gain O
_my_ O
affections O
, O
because O
I O
had O
no O
money O
, O
what O
occasion O
could O
there O
be O
for O
making O
love O
to O
a O
girl O
whom O
he O
did O
not O
care O
about O
, O
and O
who O
was O
equally O
poor O
? O
" O
" O
But O
there O
seems O
indelicacy O
in O
directing O
his O
attentions O
towards O
her O
so O
soon O
after O
this O
event O
. O
" O
" O
A O
man O
in O
distressed O
circumstances O
has O
not O
time O
for O
all O
those O
elegant O
decorums O
which O
other O
people O
may O
observe O
. O
If O
_she_ O
does O
not O
object O
to O
it O
, O
why O
should O
_we_ O
? O
" O
" O
_Her_ O
not O
objecting O
does O
not O
justify O
_him_ O
. O
It O
only O
shows O
her O
being O
deficient O
in O
something O
herself O
-- O
sense O
or O
feeling O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
have O
it O
as O
you O
choose O
. O
_He_ O
shall O
be O
mercenary O
, O
and O
_she_ O
shall O
be O
foolish O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
that O
is O
what O
I O
do O
_not_ O
choose O
. O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
, O
you O
know O
, O
to O
think O
ill O
of O
a O
young O
man O
who O
has O
lived O
so O
long O
in O
Derbyshire O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
if O
that O
is O
all O
, O
I O
have O
a O
very O
poor O
opinion O
of O
young O
men O
who O
live O
in O
Derbyshire O
; O
and O
their O
intimate O
friends O
who O
live O
in O
Hertfordshire O
are O
not O
much O
better O
. O
I O
am O
sick O
of O
them O
all O
. O
Thank O
heaven O
! O
I O
am O
going O
to-morrow O
where O
I O
shall O
find O
a O
man O
who O
has O
not O
one O
agreeable O
quality O
, O
who O
has O
neither O
manners O
nor O
sense O
to O
recommend O
him O
. O
Stupid O
men O
are O
the O
only O
ones O
worth O
knowing O
, O
after O
all O
. O
" O
" O
Take O
care O
, O
Lizzy O
; O
that O
speech O
savours O
strongly O
of O
disappointment O
. O
" O
Before O
they O
were O
separated O
by O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
play O
, O
she O
had O
the O
unexpected O
happiness O
of O
an O
invitation O
to O
accompany O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
in O
a O
tour O
of O
pleasure O
which O
they O
proposed O
taking O
in O
the O
summer O
. O
" O
We O
have O
not O
quite O
determined O
how O
far O
it O
shall O
carry O
us O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs O
. O
Gardiner O
; O
" O
but O
perhaps O
, O
to O
the O
Lakes O
. O
" O
No O
scheme O
could O
have O
been O
more O
agreeable O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
her O
acceptance O
of O
the O
invitation O
was O
most O
ready O
and O
grateful O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
dear O
aunt O
, O
" O
she O
rapturously O
cried O
, O
" O
what O
delight O
! O
what O
felicity O
! O
You O
give O
me O
fresh O
life O
and O
vigour O
. O
Adieu O
to O
disappointment O
and O
spleen O
. O
What O
are O
men O
to O
rocks O
and O
mountains O
? O
Oh O
, O
what O
hours O
of O
transport O
we O
shall O
spend O
! O
And O
when O
we O
_do_ O
return O
, O
it O
shall O
not O
be O
like O
other O
travellers O
, O
without O
being O
able O
to O
give O
one O
accurate O
idea O
of O
anything O
. O
We O
_will_ O
know O
where O
we O
have O
gone O
-- O
we O
_will_ O
recollect O
what O
we O
have O
seen O
. O
Lakes O
, O
mountains O
, O
and O
rivers O
, O
shall O
not O
be O
jumbled O
together O
in O
our O
imaginations O
; O
nor O
, O
when O
we O
attempt O
to O
describe O
any O
particular O
scene O
, O
will O
we O
begin O
quarrelling O
about O
its O
relative O
situation O
. O
Let O
_our_ O
first O
effusions O
be O
less O
insupportable O
than O
those O
of O
the O
generality O
of O
travellers O
. O
