At O
five O
o'clock O
the O
two O
ladies O
retired O
to O
dress O
, O
and O
at O
half-past O
six O
Elizabeth O
was O
summoned O
to O
dinner O
. O
To O
the O
civil O
inquiries O
which O
then O
poured O
in O
, O
and O
amongst O
which O
she O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
distinguishing O
the O
much O
superior O
solicitude O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
she O
could O
not O
make O
a O
very O
favourable O
answer O
. O
Jane O
was O
by O
no O
means O
better O
. O
The O
sisters O
, O
on O
hearing O
this O
, O
repeated O
three O
or O
four O
times O
how O
much O
they O
were O
grieved O
, O
how O
shocking O
it O
was O
to O
have O
a O
bad O
cold O
, O
and O
how O
excessively O
they O
disliked O
being O
ill O
themselves O
; O
and O
then O
thought O
no O
more O
of O
the O
matter O
: O
and O
their O
indifference O
towards O
Jane O
, O
when O
not O
immediately O
before O
them O
, O
restored O
Elizabeth O
to O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
all O
her O
original O
dislike O
. O
Their O
brother O
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
the O
only O
one O
of O
the O
party O
whom O
she O
could O
regard O
with O
any O
complacency O
. O
His O
anxiety O
for O
Jane O
was O
evident O
, O
and O
his O
attentions O
to O
herself O
most O
pleasing O
; O
and O
they O
prevented O
her O
feeling O
herself O
so O
much O
an O
intruder O
as O
she O
believed O
she O
was O
considered O
by O
the O
others O
. O
She O
had O
very O
little O
notice O
from O
any O
but O
him O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
engrossed O
by O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
her O
sister O
scarcely O
less O
so O
; O
and O
as O
for O
Mr O
. O
Hurst O
, O
by O
whom O
Elizabeth O
sat O
, O
he O
was O
an O
indolent O
man O
, O
who O
lived O
only O
to O
eat O
, O
drink O
, O
and O
play O
at O
cards O
, O
who O
, O
when O
he O
found O
her O
prefer O
a O
plain O
dish O
to O
a O
ragout O
, O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
to O
her O
. O
When O
dinner O
was O
over O
, O
she O
returned O
directly O
to O
Jane O
, O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
began O
abusing O
her O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Her O
manners O
were O
pronounced O
to O
be O
very O
bad O
indeed O
, O
-- O
a O
mixture O
of O
pride O
and O
impertinence O
: O
she O
had O
no O
conversation O
, O
no O
style O
, O
no O
taste O
, O
no O
beauty O
. O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
thought O
the O
same O
, O
and O
added O
, O
-- O
" O
She O
has O
nothing O
, O
in O
short O
, O
to O
recommend O
her O
, O
but O
being O
an O
excellent O
walker O
. O
I O
shall O
never O
forget O
her O
appearance O
this O
morning O
. O
She O
really O
looked O
almost O
wild O
. O
" O
" O
She O
did O
indeed O
, O
Louisa O
. O
I O
could O
hardly O
keep O
my O
countenance O
. O
Very O
nonsensical O
to O
come O
at O
all O
! O
Why O
must O
_she_ O
be O
scampering O
about O
the O
country O
, O
because O
her O
sister O
had O
a O
cold O
? O
Her O
hair O
so O
untidy O
, O
so O
blowzy O
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
and O
her O
petticoat O
; O
I O
hope O
you O
saw O
her O
petticoat O
, O
six O
inches O
deep O
in O
mud O
, O
I O
am O
absolutely O
certain O
, O
and O
the O
gown O
which O
had O
been O
let O
down O
to O
hide O
it O
not O
doing O
its O
office O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
picture O
may O
be O
very O
exact O
, O
Louisa O
, O
" O
said O
Bingley O
; O
" O
but O
this O
was O
all O
lost O
upon O
me O
. O
I O
thought O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
Bennet O
looked O
remarkably O
well O
when O
she O
came O
into O
the O
room O
this O
morning O
. O
Her O
dirty O
petticoat O
quite O
escaped O
my O
notice O
. O
" O
" O
_You_ O
observed O
it O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
; O
" O
and O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
you O
would O
not O
wish O
to O
see O
_your O
sister_ O
make O
such O
an O
exhibition O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
not O
. O
" O
" O
To O
walk O
three O
miles O
, O
or O
four O
miles O
, O
or O
five O
miles O
, O
or O
whatever O
it O
is O
, O
above O
her O
ancles O
in O
dirt O
, O
and O
alone O
, O
quite O
alone O
! O
what O
could O
she O
mean O
by O
it O
? O
It O
seems O
to O
me O
to O
show O
an O
abominable O
sort O
of O
conceited O
independence O
, O
a O
most O
country-town O
indifference O
to O
decorum O
. O
" O
" O
It O
shows O
an O
affection O
for O
her O
sister O
that O
is O
very O
pleasing O
, O
" O
said O
Bingley O
. O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
" O
observed O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
in O
a O
half O
whisper O
, O
" O
that O
this O
adventure O
has O
rather O
affected O
your O
admiration O
of O
her O
fine O
eyes O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
at O
all O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
: O
" O
they O
were O
brightened O
by O
the O
exercise O
. O
" O
A O
short O
pause O
followed O
this O
speech O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
began O
again O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
have O
an O
excessive O
regard O
for O
Jane O
Bennet O
, O
-- O
she O
is O
really O
a O
very O
sweet O
girl O
, O
-- O
and O
I O
wish O
with O
all O
my O
heart O
she O
were O
well O
settled O
. O
But O
with O
such O
a O
father O
and O
mother O
, O
and O
such O
low O
connections O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
there O
is O
no O
chance O
of O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
I O
have O
heard O
you O
say O
that O
their O
uncle O
is O
an O
attorney O
in O
Meryton O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
and O
they O
have O
another O
, O
who O
lives O
somewhere O
near O
Cheapside O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
capital O
, O
" O
added O
her O
sister O
; O
and O
they O
both O
laughed O
heartily O
. O
" O
If O
they O
had O
uncles O
enough O
to O
fill O
_all_ O
Cheapside O
, O
" O
cried O
Bingley O
, O
" O
it O
would O
not O
make O
them O
one O
jot O
less O
agreeable O
. O
" O
" O
But O
it O
must O
very O
materially O
lessen O
their O
chance O
of O
marrying O
men O
of O
any O
consideration O
in O
the O
world O
, O
" O
replied O
Darcy O
. O
To O
this O
speech O
Bingley O
made O
no O
answer O
; O
but O
his O
sisters O
gave O
it O
their O
hearty O
assent O
, O
and O
indulged O
their O
mirth O
for O
some O
time O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
their O
dear O
friend O
's O
vulgar O
relations O
. O
With O
a O
renewal O
of O
tenderness O
, O
however O
, O
they O
repaired O
to O
her O
room O
on O
leaving O
the O
dining-parlour O
, O
and O
sat O
with O
her O
till O
summoned O
to O
coffee O
. O
She O
was O
still O
very O
poorly O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
would O
not O
quit O
her O
at O
all O
, O
till O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
when O
she O
had O
the O
comfort O
of O
seeing O
her O
asleep O
, O
and O
when O
it O
appeared O
to O
her O
rather O
right O
than O
pleasant O
that O
she O
should O
go O
down O
stairs O
herself O
. O
On O
entering O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
she O
found O
the O
whole O
party O
at O
loo O
, O
and O
was O
immediately O
invited O
to O
join O
them O
; O
but O
suspecting O
them O
to O
be O
playing O
high O
, O
she O
declined O
it O
, O
and O
making O
her O
sister O
the O
excuse O
, O
said O
she O
would O
amuse O
herself O
, O
for O
the O
short O
time O
she O
could O
stay O
below O
, O
with O
a O
book O
. O
Mr. O
Hurst O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
astonishment O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
prefer O
reading O
to O
cards O
? O
" O
said O
he O
; O
" O
that O
is O
rather O
singular O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Eliza O
Bennet O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
" O
despises O
cards O
. O
She O
is O
a O
great O
reader O
, O
and O
has O
no O
pleasure O
in O
anything O
else O
. O
" O
" O
I O
deserve O
neither O
such O
praise O
nor O
such O
censure O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
I O
am O
_not_ O
a O
great O
reader O
, O
and O
I O
have O
pleasure O
in O
many O
things O
. O
" O
" O
In O
nursing O
your O
sister O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
have O
pleasure O
, O
" O
said O
Bingley O
; O
" O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
soon O
be O
increased O
by O
seeing O
her O
quite O
well O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
thanked O
him O
from O
her O
heart O
, O
and O
then O
walked O
towards O
a O
table O
where O
a O
few O
books O
were O
lying O
. O
He O
immediately O
offered O
to O
fetch O
her O
others O
; O
all O
that O
his O
library O
afforded O
. O
" O
And O
I O
wish O
my O
collection O
were O
larger O
for O
your O
benefit O
and O
my O
own O
credit O
; O
but O
I O
am O
an O
idle O
fellow O
; O
and O
though O
I O
have O
not O
many O
, O
I O
have O
more O
than O
I O
ever O
looked O
into O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
assured O
him O
that O
she O
could O
suit O
herself O
perfectly O
with O
those O
in O
the O
room O
. O
" O
I O
am O
astonished O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
" O
that O
my O
father O
should O
have O
left O
so O
small O
a O
collection O
of O
books O
. O
What O
a O
delightful O
library O
you O
have O
at O
Pemberley O
, O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
! O
" O
" O
It O
ought O
to O
be O
good O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
: O
" O
it O
has O
been O
the O
work O
of O
many O
generations O
. O
" O
" O
And O
then O
you O
have O
added O
so O
much O
to O
it O
yourself O
-- O
you O
are O
always O
buying O
books O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
comprehend O
the O
neglect O
of O
a O
family O
library O
in O
such O
days O
as O
these O
. O
" O
" O
Neglect O
! O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
neglect O
nothing O
that O
can O
add O
to O
the O
beauties O
of O
that O
noble O
place O
. O
Charles O
, O
when O
you O
build O
_your_ O
house O
, O
I O
wish O
it O
may O
be O
half O
as O
delightful O
as O
Pemberley O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
it O
may O
. O
" O
" O
But O
I O
would O
really O
advise O
you O
to O
make O
your O
purchase O
in O
that O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
take O
Pemberley O
for O
a O
kind O
of O
model O
. O
There O
is O
not O
a O
finer O
county O
in O
England O
than O
Derbyshire O
. O
" O
" O
With O
all O
my O
heart O
: O
I O
will O
buy O
Pemberley O
itself O
, O
if O
Darcy O
will O
sell O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
talking O
of O
possibilities O
, O
Charles O
. O
" O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Caroline O
, O
I O
should O
think O
it O
more O
possible O
to O
get O
Pemberley O
by O
purchase O
than O
by O
imitation O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
so O
much O
caught O
by O
what O
passed O
, O
as O
to O
leave O
her O
very O
little O
attention O
for O
her O
book O
; O
and O
, O
soon O
laying O
it O
wholly O
aside O
, O
she O
drew O
near O
the O
card-table O
, O
and O
stationed O
herself O
between O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
his O
eldest O
sister O
, O
to O
observe O
the O
game O
. O
" O
Is O
Miss O
Darcy O
much O
grown O
since O
the O
spring O
? O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
: O
" O
will O
she O
be O
as O
tall O
as O
I O
am O
? O
" O
" O
I O
think O
she O
will O
. O
She O
is O
now O
about O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
Bennet O
's O
height O
, O
or O
rather O
taller O
. O
" O
" O
How O
I O
long O
to O
see O
her O
again O
! O
I O
never O
met O
with O
anybody O
who O
delighted O
me O
so O
much O
. O
Such O
a O
countenance O
, O
such O
manners O
, O
and O
so O
extremely O
accomplished O
for O
her O
age O
! O
Her O
performance O
on O
the O
pianoforte O
is O
exquisite O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
amazing O
to O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Bingley O
, O
" O
how O
young O
ladies O
can O
have O
patience O
to O
be O
so O
very O
accomplished O
as O
they O
all O
are O
. O
" O
" O
All O
young O
ladies O
accomplished O
! O
My O
dear O
Charles O
, O
what O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
all O
of O
them O
, O
I O
think O
. O
They O
all O
paint O
tables O
, O
cover O
screens O
, O
and O
net O
purses O
. O
I O
scarcely O
know O
any O
one O
who O
can O
not O
do O
all O
this O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
never O
heard O
a O
young O
lady O
spoken O
of O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
without O
being O
informed O
that O
she O
was O
very O
accomplished O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
list O
of O
the O
common O
extent O
of O
accomplishments O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
, O
" O
has O
too O
much O
truth O
. O
The O
word O
is O
applied O
to O
many O
a O
woman O
who O
deserves O
it O
no O
otherwise O
than O
by O
netting O
a O
purse O
or O
covering O
a O
screen O
; O
but O
I O
am O
very O
far O
from O
agreeing O
with O
you O
in O
your O
estimation O
of O
ladies O
in O
general O
. O
I O
can O
not O
boast O
of O
knowing O
more O
than O
half-a-dozen O
in O
the O
whole O
range O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
that O
are O
really O
accomplished O
. O
" O
" O
Nor O
I O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
. O
" O
Then O
, O
" O
observed O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
you O
must O
comprehend O
a O
great O
deal O
in O
your O
idea O
of O
an O
accomplished O
woman O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
I O
do O
comprehend O
a O
great O
deal O
in O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
certainly O
, O
" O
cried O
his O
faithful O
assistant O
, O
" O
no O
one O
can O
be O
really O
esteemed O
accomplished O
who O
does O
not O
greatly O
surpass O
what O
is O
usually O
met O
with O
. O
A O
woman O
must O
have O
a O
thorough O
knowledge O
of O
music O
, O
singing O
, O
drawing O
, O
dancing O
, O
and O
the O
modern O
languages O
, O
to O
deserve O
the O
word O
; O
and O
, O
besides O
all O
this O
, O
she O
must O
possess O
a O
certain O
something O
in O
her O
air O
and O
manner O
of O
walking O
, O
the O
tone O
of O
her O
voice O
, O
her O
address O
and O
expressions O
, O
or O
the O
word O
will O
be O
but O
half O
deserved O
. O
" O
" O
All O
this O
she O
must O
possess O
, O
" O
added O
Darcy O
; O
" O
and O
to O
all O
she O
must O
yet O
add O
something O
more O
substantial O
in O
the O
improvement O
of O
her O
mind O
by O
extensive O
reading O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
no O
longer O
surprised O
at O
your O
knowing O
_only_ O
six O
accomplished O
women O
. O
I O
rather O
wonder O
now O
at O
your O
knowing O
_any_ O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
so O
severe O
upon O
your O
own O
sex O
as O
to O
doubt O
the O
possibility O
of O
all O
this O
? O
" O
" O
_I_ O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
woman O
. O
_I_ O
never O
saw O
such O
capacity O
, O
and O
taste O
, O
and O
application O
, O
and O
elegance O
, O
as O
you O
describe O
, O
united O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
both O
cried O
out O
against O
the O
injustice O
of O
her O
implied O
doubt O
, O
and O
were O
both O
protesting O
that O
they O
knew O
many O
women O
who O
answered O
this O
description O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Hurst O
called O
them O
to O
order O
, O
with O
bitter O
complaints O
of O
their O
inattention O
to O
what O
was O
going O
forward O
. O
As O
all O
conversation O
was O
thereby O
at O
an O
end O
, O
Elizabeth O
soon O
afterwards O
left O
the O
room O
. O
" O
Eliza O
Bennet O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
when O
the O
door O
was O
closed O
on O
her O
, O
" O
is O
one O
of O
those O
young O
ladies O
who O
seek O
to O
recommend O
themselves O
to O
the O
other O
sex O
by O
undervaluing O
their O
own O
; O
and O
with O
many O
men O
, O
I O
daresay O
, O
it O
succeeds O
; O
but O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
is O
a O
paltry O
device O
, O
a O
very O
mean O
art O
. O
" O
" O
Undoubtedly O
, O
" O
replied O
Darcy O
, O
to O
whom O
this O
remark O
was O
chiefly O
addressed O
, O
" O
there O
is O
meanness O
in O
_all_ O
the O
arts O
which O
ladies O
sometimes O
condescend O
to O
employ O
for O
captivation O
. O
Whatever O
bears O
affinity O
to O
cunning O
is O
despicable O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
not O
so O
entirely O
satisfied O
with O
this O
reply O
as O
to O
continue O
the O
subject O
. O
Elizabeth O
joined O
them O
again O
only O
to O
say O
that O
her O
sister O
was O
worse O
, O
and O
that O
she O
could O
not O
leave O
her O
. O
Bingley O
urged O
Mr. O
Jones O
's O
being O
sent O
for O
immediately O
; O
while O
his O
sisters O
, O
convinced O
that O
no O
country O
advice O
could O
be O
of O
any O
service O
, O
recommended O
an O
express O
to O
town O
for O
one O
of O
the O
most O
eminent O
physicians O
. O
This O
she O
would O
not O
hear O
of O
; O
but O
she O
was O
not O
so O
unwilling O
to O
comply O
with O
their O
brother O
's O
proposal O
; O
and O
it O
was O
settled O
that O
Mr. O
Jones O
should O
be O
sent O
for O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
if O
Miss O
Bennet O
were O
not O
decidedly O
better O
. O
Bingley O
was O
quite O
uncomfortable O
; O
his O
sisters O
declared O
that O
they O
were O
miserable O
. O
They O
solaced O
their O
wretchedness O
, O
however O
, O
by O
duets O
after O
supper O
; O
while O
he O
could O
find O
no O
better O
relief O
to O
his O
feelings O
than O
by O
giving O
his O
housekeeper O
directions O
that O
every O
possible O
attention O
might O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
sick O
lady O
and O
her O
sister O
