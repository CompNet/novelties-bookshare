When O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
were O
alone O
, O
the O
former O
, O
who O
had O
been O
cautious O
in O
her O
praise O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
before O
, O
expressed O
to O
her O
sister O
how O
very O
much O
she O
admired O
him O
. O
" O
He O
is O
just O
what O
a O
young-man O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
sensible O
, O
good-humoured O
, O
lively O
; O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
such O
happy O
manners O
! O
so O
much O
ease O
, O
with O
such O
perfect O
good O
breeding O
! O
" O
" O
He O
is O
also O
handsome O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
which O
a O
young O
man O
ought O
likewise O
to O
be O
if O
he O
possibly O
can O
. O
His O
character O
is O
thereby O
complete O
. O
" O
" O
I O
was O
very O
much O
flattered O
by O
his O
asking O
me O
to O
dance O
a O
second O
time O
. O
I O
did O
not O
expect O
such O
a O
compliment O
. O
" O
" O
Did O
not O
you O
? O
_I_ O
did O
for O
you O
. O
But O
that O
is O
one O
great O
difference O
between O
us O
. O
Compliments O
always O
take O
_you_ O
by O
surprise O
, O
and O
_me_ O
never O
. O
What O
could O
be O
more O
natural O
than O
his O
asking O
you O
again O
? O
He O
could O
not O
help O
seeing O
that O
you O
were O
about O
five O
times O
as O
pretty O
as O
every O
other O
woman O
in O
the O
room O
. O
No O
thanks O
to O
his O
gallantry O
for O
that O
. O
Well O
, O
he O
certainly O
is O
very O
agreeable O
, O
and O
I O
give O
you O
leave O
to O
like O
him O
. O
You O
have O
liked O
many O
a O
stupider O
person O
. O
" O
" O
Dear O
Lizzy O
! O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
you O
are O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
apt O
, O
you O
know O
, O
to O
like O
people O
in O
general O
. O
You O
never O
see O
a O
fault O
in O
anybody O
. O
All O
the O
world O
are O
good O
and O
agreeable O
in O
your O
eyes O
. O
I O
never O
heard O
you O
speak O
ill O
of O
a O
human O
being O
in O
my O
life O
. O
" O
" O
I O
would O
wish O
not O
to O
be O
hasty O
in O
censuring O
anyone O
; O
but O
I O
always O
speak O
what O
I O
think O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
you O
do O
: O
and O
it O
is O
_that_ O
which O
makes O
the O
wonder O
. O
With O
_your_ O
good O
sense O
, O
to O
be O
so O
honestly O
blind O
to O
the O
follies O
and O
nonsense O
of O
others O
! O
Affectation O
of O
candour O
is O
common O
enough O
; O
one O
meets O
with O
it O
everywhere O
. O
But O
to O
be O
candid O
without O
ostentation O
or O
design O
, O
-- O
to O
take O
the O
good O
of O
everybody O
's O
character O
and O
make O
it O
still O
better O
, O
and O
say O
nothing O
of O
the O
bad O
, O
-- O
belongs O
to O
you O
alone O
. O
And O
so O
, O
you O
like O
this O
man O
's O
sisters O
, O
too O
, O
do O
you O
? O
Their O
manners O
are O
not O
equal O
to O
his O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
not O
, O
at O
first O
; O
but O
they O
are O
very O
pleasing O
women O
when O
you O
converse O
with O
them O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
is O
to O
live O
with O
her O
brother O
, O
and O
keep O
his O
house O
; O
and O
I O
am O
much O
mistaken O
if O
we O
shall O
not O
find O
a O
very O
charming O
neighbour O
in O
her O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
listened O
in O
silence O
, O
but O
was O
not O
convinced O
: O
their O
behaviour O
at O
the O
assembly O
had O
not O
been O
calculated O
to O
please O
in O
general O
; O
and O
with O
more O
quickness O
of O
observation O
and O
less O
pliancy O
of O
temper O
than O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
with O
a O
judgment O
, O
too O
, O
unassailed O
by O
any O
attention O
to O
herself O
, O
she O
was O
very O
little O
disposed O
to O
approve O
them O
. O
They O
were O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
very O
fine O
ladies O
; O
not O
deficient O
in O
good-humour O
when O
they O
were O
pleased O
, O
nor O
in O
the O
power O
of O
being O
agreeable O
where O
they O
chose O
it O
; O
but O
proud O
and O
conceited O
. O
They O
were O
rather O
handsome O
; O
had O
been O
educated O
in O
one O
of O
the O
first O
private O
seminaries O
in O
town O
; O
had O
a O
fortune O
of O
twenty O
thousand O
pounds O
; O
were O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
spending O
more O
than O
they O
ought O
, O
and O
of O
associating O
with O
people O
of O
rank O
; O
and O
were O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
every O
respect O
entitled O
to O
think O
well O
of O
themselves O
and O
meanly O
of O
others O
. O
They O
were O
of O
a O
respectable O
family O
in O
the O
north O
of O
England O
; O
a O
circumstance O
more O
deeply O
impressed O
on O
their O
memories O
than O
that O
their O
brother O
's O
fortune O
and O
their O
own O
had O
been O
acquired O
by O
trade O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
inherited O
property O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
nearly O
a O
hundred O
thousand O
pounds O
from O
his O
father O
, O
who O
had O
intended O
to O
purchase O
an O
estate O
, O
but O
did O
not O
live O
to O
do O
it O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
intended O
it O
likewise O
, O
and O
sometimes O
made O
choice O
of O
his O
county O
; O
but O
, O
as O
he O
was O
now O
provided O
with O
a O
good O
house O
and O
the O
liberty O
of O
a O
manor O
, O
it O
was O
doubtful O
to O
many O
of O
those O
who O
best O
knew O
the O
easiness O
of O
his O
temper O
, O
whether O
he O
might O
not O
spend O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
days O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
and O
leave O
the O
next O
generation O
to O
purchase O
. O
His O
sisters O
were O
very O
anxious O
for O
his O
having O
an O
estate O
of O
his O
own O
; O
but O
though O
he O
was O
now O
established O
only O
as O
a O
tenant O
, O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
by O
no O
means O
unwilling O
to O
preside O
at O
his O
table O
; O
nor O
was O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
, O
who O
had O
married O
a O
man O
of O
more O
fashion O
than O
fortune O
, O
less O
disposed O
to O
consider O
his O
house O
as O
her O
home O
when O
it O
suited O
her O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
had O
not O
been O
of O
age O
two O
years O
when O
he O
was O
tempted O
, O
by O
an O
accidental O
recommendation O
, O
to O
look O
at O
Netherfield O
House O
. O
He O
did O
look O
at O
it O
, O
and O
into O
it O
, O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
; O
was O
pleased O
with O
the O
situation O
and O
the O
principal O
rooms O
, O
satisfied O
with O
what O
the O
owner O
said O
in O
its O
praise O
, O
and O
took O
it O
immediately O
. O
Between O
him O
and O
Darcy O
there O
was O
a O
very O
steady O
friendship O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
a O
great O
opposition O
of O
character O
. O
Bingley O
was O
endeared O
to O
Darcy O
by O
the O
easiness O
, O
openness O
, O
and O
ductility O
of O
his O
temper O
, O
though O
no O
disposition O
could O
offer O
a O
greater O
contrast O
to O
his O
own O
, O
and O
though O
with O
his O
own O
he O
never O
appeared O
dissatisfied O
. O
On O
the O
strength O
of O
Darcy O
's O
regard O
, O
Bingley O
had O
the O
firmest O
reliance O
, O
and O
of O
his O
judgment O
the O
highest O
opinion O
. O
In O
understanding O
, O
Darcy O
was O
the O
superior O
. O
Bingley O
was O
by O
no O
means O
deficient O
; O
but O
Darcy O
was O
clever O
. O
He O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
haughty O
, O
reserved O
, O
and O
fastidious O
; O
and O
his O
manners O
, O
though O
well O
bred O
, O
were O
not O
inviting O
. O
In O
that O
respect O
his O
friend O
had O
greatly O
the O
advantage O
. O
Bingley O
was O
sure O
of O
being O
liked O
wherever O
he O
appeared O
; O
Darcy O
was O
continually O
giving O
offence O
. O
The O
manner O
in O
which O
they O
spoke O
of O
the O
Meryton O
assembly O
was O
sufficiently O
characteristic O
. O
Bingley O
had O
never O
met O
with O
pleasanter O
people O
or O
prettier O
girls O
in O
his O
life O
; O
everybody O
had O
been O
most O
kind O
and O
attentive O
to O
him O
; O
there O
had O
been O
no O
formality O
, O
no O
stiffness O
; O
he O
had O
soon O
felt O
acquainted O
with O
all O
the O
room O
; O
and O
as O
to O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
he O
could O
not O
conceive O
an O
angel O
more O
beautiful O
. O
Darcy O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
had O
seen O
a O
collection O
of O
people O
in O
whom O
there O
was O
little O
beauty O
and O
no O
fashion O
, O
for O
none O
of O
whom O
he O
had O
felt O
the O
smallest O
interest O
, O
and O
from O
none O
received O
either O
attention O
or O
pleasure O
. O
Miss O
Bennet O
he O
acknowledged O
to O
be O
pretty O
; O
but O
she O
smiled O
too O
much O
. O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
her O
sister O
allowed O
it O
to O
be O
so O
; O
but O
still O
they O
admired O
her O
and O
liked O
her O
, O
and O
pronounced O
her O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
girl O
, O
and O
one O
whom O
they O
should O
not O
object O
to O
know O
more O
of O
. O
Miss O
Bennet O
was O
therefore O
established O
as O
a O
sweet O
girl O
; O
and O
their O
brother O
felt O
authorized O
by O
such O
commendation O
to O
think O
of O
her O
as O
he O
chose O
. O
