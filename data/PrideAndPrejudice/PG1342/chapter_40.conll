Elizabeth O
's O
impatience O
to O
acquaint O
Jane O
with O
what O
had O
happened O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
overcome O
; O
and O
at O
length O
resolving O
to O
suppress O
every O
particular O
in O
which O
her O
sister O
was O
concerned O
, O
and O
preparing O
her O
to O
be O
surprised O
, O
she O
related O
to O
her O
the O
next O
morning O
the O
chief O
of O
the O
scene O
between O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
and O
herself O
. O
Miss O
Bennet O
's O
astonishment O
was O
soon O
lessened O
by O
the O
strong O
sisterly O
partiality O
which O
made O
any O
admiration O
of O
Elizabeth O
appear O
perfectly O
natural O
; O
and O
all O
surprise O
was O
shortly O
lost O
in O
other O
feelings O
. O
She O
was O
sorry O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
should O
have O
delivered O
his O
sentiments O
in O
a O
manner O
so O
little O
suited O
to O
recommend O
them O
; O
but O
still O
more O
was O
she O
grieved O
for O
the O
unhappiness O
which O
her O
sister O
's O
refusal O
must O
have O
given O
him O
. O
" O
His O
being O
so O
sure O
of O
succeeding O
was O
wrong O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
and O
certainly O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
appeared O
; O
but O
consider O
how O
much O
it O
must O
increase O
his O
disappointment O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
I O
am O
heartily O
sorry O
for O
him O
; O
but O
he O
has O
other O
feelings O
which O
will O
probably O
soon O
drive O
away O
his O
regard O
for O
me O
. O
You O
do O
not O
blame O
me O
, O
however O
, O
for O
refusing O
him O
? O
" O
" O
Blame O
you O
! O
Oh O
, O
no O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
blame O
me O
for O
having O
spoken O
so O
warmly O
of O
Wickham O
? O
" O
" O
No O
-- O
I O
do O
not O
know O
that O
you O
were O
wrong O
in O
saying O
what O
you O
did O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
_will_ O
know O
it O
, O
when O
I O
have O
told O
you O
what O
happened O
the O
very O
next O
day O
. O
" O
She O
then O
spoke O
of O
the O
letter O
, O
repeating O
the O
whole O
of O
its O
contents O
as O
far O
as O
they O
concerned O
George O
Wickham O
. O
What O
a O
stroke O
was O
this O
for O
poor O
Jane O
, O
who O
would O
willingly O
have O
gone O
through O
the O
world O
without O
believing O
that O
so O
much O
wickedness O
existed O
in O
the O
whole O
race O
of O
mankind O
as O
was O
here O
collected O
in O
one O
individual O
! O
Nor O
was O
Darcy O
's O
vindication O
, O
though O
grateful O
to O
her O
feelings O
, O
capable O
of O
consoling O
her O
for O
such O
discovery O
. O
Most O
earnestly O
did O
she O
labour O
to O
prove O
the O
probability O
of O
error O
, O
and O
seek O
to O
clear O
one O
, O
without O
involving O
the O
other O
. O
" O
This O
will O
not O
do O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
you O
never O
will O
be O
able O
to O
make O
both O
of O
them O
good O
for O
anything O
. O
Take O
your O
choice O
, O
but O
you O
must O
be O
satisfied O
with O
only O
one O
. O
There O
is O
but O
such O
a O
quantity O
of O
merit O
between O
them O
; O
just O
enough O
to O
make O
one O
good O
sort O
of O
man O
; O
and O
of O
late O
it O
has O
been O
shifting O
about O
pretty O
much O
. O
For O
my O
part O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
believe O
it O
all O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
's O
, O
but O
you O
shall O
do O
as O
you O
choose O
. O
" O
It O
was O
some O
time O
, O
however O
, O
before O
a O
smile O
could O
be O
extorted O
from O
Jane O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
when O
I O
have O
been O
more O
shocked O
, O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
Wickham O
so O
very O
bad O
! O
It O
is O
almost O
past O
belief O
. O
And O
poor O
Mr. O
Darcy O
! O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
only O
consider O
what O
he O
must O
have O
suffered O
. O
Such O
a O
disappointment O
! O
and O
with O
the O
knowledge O
of O
your O
ill O
opinion O
too O
! O
and O
having O
to O
relate O
such O
a O
thing O
of O
his O
sister O
! O
It O
is O
really O
too O
distressing O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
must O
feel O
it O
so O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
no O
, O
my O
regret O
and O
compassion O
are O
all O
done O
away O
by O
seeing O
you O
so O
full O
of O
both O
. O
I O
know O
you O
will O
do O
him O
such O
ample O
justice O
, O
that O
I O
am O
growing O
every O
moment O
more O
unconcerned O
and O
indifferent O
. O
Your O
profusion O
makes O
me O
saving O
; O
and O
if O
you O
lament O
over O
him O
much O
longer O
, O
my O
heart O
will O
be O
as O
light O
as O
a O
feather O
. O
" O
" O
Poor O
Wickham O
! O
there O
is O
such O
an O
expression O
of O
goodness O
in O
his O
countenance O
! O
such O
an O
openness O
and O
gentleness O
in O
his O
manner O
. O
" O
" O
There O
certainly O
was O
some O
great O
mismanagement O
in O
the O
education O
of O
those O
two O
young O
men O
. O
One O
has O
got O
all O
the O
goodness O
, O
and O
the O
other O
all O
the O
appearance O
of O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
never O
thought O
Mr. O
Darcy O
so O
deficient O
in O
the O
_appearance_ O
of O
it O
as O
you O
used O
to O
do O
. O
" O
" O
And O
yet O
I O
meant O
to O
be O
uncommonly O
clever O
in O
taking O
so O
decided O
a O
dislike O
to O
him O
, O
without O
any O
reason O
. O
It O
is O
such O
a O
spur O
to O
one O
's O
genius O
, O
such O
an O
opening O
for O
wit O
, O
to O
have O
a O
dislike O
of O
that O
kind O
. O
One O
may O
be O
continually O
abusive O
without O
saying O
anything O
just O
; O
but O
one O
can O
not O
be O
always O
laughing O
at O
a O
man O
without O
now O
and O
then O
stumbling O
on O
something O
witty O
. O
" O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
when O
you O
first O
read O
that O
letter O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
could O
not O
treat O
the O
matter O
as O
you O
do O
now O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
I O
could O
not O
. O
I O
was O
uncomfortable O
enough O
, O
I O
was O
very O
uncomfortable O
-- O
I O
may O
say O
unhappy O
. O
And O
with O
no O
one O
to O
speak O
to O
of O
what O
I O
felt O
, O
no O
Jane O
to O
comfort O
me O
, O
and O
say O
that O
I O
had O
not O
been O
so O
very O
weak O
, O
and O
vain O
, O
and O
nonsensical O
, O
as O
I O
knew O
I O
had O
! O
Oh O
, O
how O
I O
wanted O
you O
! O
" O
" O
How O
unfortunate O
that O
you O
should O
have O
used O
such O
very O
strong O
expressions O
in O
speaking O
of O
Wickham O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
for O
now O
they O
_do_ O
appear O
wholly O
undeserved O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
. O
But O
the O
misfortune O
of O
speaking O
with O
bitterness O
is O
a O
most O
natural O
consequence O
of O
the O
prejudices O
I O
had O
been O
encouraging O
. O
There O
is O
one O
point O
on O
which O
I O
want O
your O
advice O
. O
I O
want O
to O
be O
told O
whether O
I O
ought O
, O
or O
ought O
not O
, O
to O
make O
our O
acquaintance O
in O
general O
understand O
Wickham O
's O
character O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
paused O
a O
little O
, O
and O
then O
replied O
, O
" O
Surely O
there O
can O
be O
no O
occasion O
for O
exposing O
him O
so O
dreadfully O
. O
What O
is O
your O
own O
opinion O
? O
" O
" O
That O
it O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
attempted O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
has O
not O
authorized O
me O
to O
make O
his O
communication O
public O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
every O
particular O
relative O
to O
his O
sister O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
kept O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
to O
myself O
; O
and O
if O
I O
endeavour O
to O
undeceive O
people O
as O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
conduct O
, O
who O
will O
believe O
me O
? O
The O
general O
prejudice O
against O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
so O
violent O
, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
death O
of O
half O
the O
good O
people O
in O
Meryton O
, O
to O
attempt O
to O
place O
him O
in O
an O
amiable O
light O
. O
I O
am O
not O
equal O
to O
it O
. O
Wickham O
will O
soon O
be O
gone O
; O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
it O
will O
not O
signify O
to O
anybody O
here O
what O
he O
really O
is O
. O
Some O
time O
hence O
it O
will O
be O
all O
found O
out O
, O
and O
then O
we O
may O
laugh O
at O
their O
stupidity O
in O
not O
knowing O
it O
before O
. O
At O
present O
I O
will O
say O
nothing O
about O
it O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
quite O
right O
. O
To O
have O
his O
errors O
made O
public O
might O
ruin O
him O
for O
ever O
. O
He O
is O
now O
, O
perhaps O
, O
sorry O
for O
what O
he O
has O
done O
, O
and O
anxious O
to O
re-establish O
a O
character O
. O
We O
must O
not O
make O
him O
desperate O
. O
" O
The O
tumult O
of O
Elizabeth O
's O
mind O
was O
allayed O
by O
this O
conversation O
. O
She O
had O
got O
rid O
of O
two O
of O
the O
secrets O
which O
had O
weighed O
on O
her O
for O
a O
fortnight O
, O
and O
was O
certain O
of O
a O
willing O
listener O
in O
Jane O
, O
whenever O
she O
might O
wish O
to O
talk O
again O
of O
either O
. O
But O
there O
was O
still O
something O
lurking O
behind O
, O
of O
which O
prudence O
forbade O
the O
disclosure O
. O
She O
dared O
not O
relate O
the O
other O
half O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
letter O
, O
nor O
explain O
to O
her O
sister O
how O
sincerely O
she O
had O
been O
valued O
by O
his O
friend O
. O
Here O
was O
knowledge O
in O
which O
no O
one O
could O
partake O
; O
and O
she O
was O
sensible O
that O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
perfect O
understanding O
between O
the O
parties O
could O
justify O
her O
in O
throwing O
off O
this O
last O
encumbrance O
of O
mystery O
. O
" O
And O
then O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
if O
that O
very O
improbable O
event O
should O
ever O
take O
place O
, O
I O
shall O
merely O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
what O
Bingley O
may O
tell O
in O
a O
much O
more O
agreeable O
manner O
himself O
. O
The O
liberty O
of O
communication O
can O
not O
be O
mine O
till O
it O
has O
lost O
all O
its O
value O
! O
" O
She O
was O
now O
, O
on O
being O
settled O
at O
home O
, O
at O
leisure O
to O
observe O
the O
real O
state O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
spirits O
. O
Jane O
was O
not O
happy O
. O
She O
still O
cherished O
a O
very O
tender O
affection O
for O
Bingley O
. O
Having O
never O
even O
fancied O
herself O
in O
love O
before O
, O
her O
regard O
had O
all O
the O
warmth O
of O
first O
attachment O
, O
and O
from O
her O
age O
and O
disposition O
, O
greater O
steadiness O
than O
first O
attachments O
often O
boast O
; O
and O
so O
fervently O
did O
she O
value O
his O
remembrance O
, O
and O
prefer O
him O
to O
every O
other O
man O
, O
that O
all O
her O
good O
sense O
, O
and O
all O
her O
attention O
to O
the O
feelings O
of O
her O
friends O
, O
were O
requisite O
to O
check O
the O
indulgence O
of O
those O
regrets O
which O
must O
have O
been O
injurious O
to O
her O
own O
health O
and O
their O
tranquillity O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
one O
day O
, O
" O
what O
is O
your O
opinion O
_now_ O
of O
this O
sad O
business O
of O
Jane O
's O
? O
For O
my O
part O
, O
I O
am O
determined O
never O
to O
speak O
of O
it O
again O
to O
anybody O
. O
I O
told O
my O
sister O
Philips O
so O
the O
other O
day O
. O
But O
I O
can O
not O
find O
out O
that O
Jane O
saw O
anything O
of O
him O
in O
London O
. O
Well O
, O
he O
is O
a O
very O
undeserving O
young O
man O
-- O
and O
I O
do O
not O
suppose O
there O
is O
the O
least O
chance O
in O
the O
world O
of O
her O
ever O
getting O
him O
now O
. O
There O
is O
no O
talk O
of O
his O
coming O
to O
Netherfield O
again O
in O
the O
summer O
; O
and O
I O
have O
inquired O
of O
everybody O
, O
too O
, O
who O
is O
likely O
to O
know O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
he O
will O
ever O
live O
at O
Netherfield O
any O
more O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
well O
! O
it O
is O
just O
as O
he O
chooses O
. O
Nobody O
wants O
him O
to O
come O
; O
though O
I O
shall O
always O
say O
that O
he O
used O
my O
daughter O
extremely O
ill O
; O
and O
, O
if O
I O
was O
her O
, O
I O
would O
not O
have O
put O
up O
with O
it O
. O
Well O
, O
my O
comfort O
is O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
Jane O
will O
die O
of O
a O
broken O
heart O
, O
and O
then O
he O
will O
be O
sorry O
for O
what O
he O
has O
done O
. O
" O
But O
as O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
receive O
comfort O
from O
any O
such O
expectation O
she O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
continued O
her O
mother O
, O
soon O
afterwards O
, O
" O
and O
so O
the O
Collinses O
live O
very O
comfortable O
, O
do O
they O
? O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
I O
only O
hope O
it O
will O
last O
. O
And O
what O
sort O
of O
table O
do O
they O
keep O
? O
Charlotte O
is O
an O
excellent O
manager O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
. O
If O
she O
is O
half O
as O
sharp O
as O
her O
mother O
, O
she O
is O
saving O
enough O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
extravagant O
in O
_their_ O
housekeeping O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
nothing O
at O
all O
. O
" O
" O
A O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
management O
, O
depend O
upon O
it O
. O
Yes O
, O
yes O
. O
_They_ O
will O
take O
care O
not O
to O
outrun O
their O
income O
. O
_They_ O
will O
never O
be O
distressed O
for O
money O
. O
Well O
, O
much O
good O
may O
it O
do O
them O
! O
And O
so O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
they O
often O
talk O
of O
having O
Longbourn O
when O
your O
father O
is O
dead O
. O
They O
look O
upon O
it O
quite O
as O
their O
own O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
whenever O
that O
happens O
. O
" O
" O
It O
was O
a O
subject O
which O
they O
could O
not O
mention O
before O
me O
. O
" O
" O
No O
; O
it O
would O
have O
been O
strange O
if O
they O
had O
. O
But O
I O
make O
no O
doubt O
they O
often O
talk O
of O
it O
between O
themselves O
. O
Well O
, O
if O
they O
can O
be O
easy O
with O
an O
estate O
that O
is O
not O
lawfully O
their O
own O
, O
so O
much O
the O
better O
. O
_I_ O
should O
be O
ashamed O
of O
having O
one O
that O
was O
only O
entailed O
on O
me O
. O
" O
