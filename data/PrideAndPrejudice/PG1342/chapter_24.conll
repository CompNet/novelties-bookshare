Miss O
Bingley O
's O
letter O
arrived O
, O
and O
put O
an O
end O
to O
doubt O
. O
The O
very O
first O
sentence O
conveyed O
the O
assurance O
of O
their O
being O
all O
settled O
in O
London O
for O
the O
winter O
, O
and O
concluded O
with O
her O
brother O
's O
regret O
at O
not O
having O
had O
time O
to O
pay O
his O
respects O
to O
his O
friends O
in O
Hertfordshire O
before O
he O
left O
the O
country O
. O
Hope O
was O
over O
, O
entirely O
over O
; O
and O
when O
Jane O
could O
attend O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
letter O
, O
she O
found O
little O
, O
except O
the O
professed O
affection O
of O
the O
writer O
, O
that O
could O
give O
her O
any O
comfort O
. O
Miss O
Darcy O
's O
praise O
occupied O
the O
chief O
of O
it O
. O
Her O
many O
attractions O
were O
again O
dwelt O
on O
; O
and O
Caroline O
boasted O
joyfully O
of O
their O
increasing O
intimacy O
, O
and O
ventured O
to O
predict O
the O
accomplishment O
of O
the O
wishes O
which O
had O
been O
unfolded O
in O
her O
former O
letter O
. O
She O
wrote O
also O
with O
great O
pleasure O
of O
her O
brother O
's O
being O
an O
inmate O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
house O
, O
and O
mentioned O
with O
raptures O
some O
plans O
of O
the O
latter O
with O
regard O
to O
new O
furniture O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
to O
whom O
Jane O
very O
soon O
communicated O
the O
chief O
of O
all O
this O
, O
heard O
it O
in O
silent O
indignation O
. O
Her O
heart O
was O
divided O
between O
concern O
for O
her O
sister O
and O
resentment O
against O
all O
others O
. O
To O
Caroline O
's O
assertion O
of O
her O
brother O
's O
being O
partial O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
she O
paid O
no O
credit O
. O
That O
he O
was O
really O
fond O
of O
Jane O
, O
she O
doubted O
no O
more O
than O
she O
had O
ever O
done O
; O
and O
much O
as O
she O
had O
always O
been O
disposed O
to O
like O
him O
, O
she O
could O
not O
think O
without O
anger O
, O
hardly O
without O
contempt O
, O
on O
that O
easiness O
of O
temper O
, O
that O
want O
of O
proper O
resolution O
, O
which O
now O
made O
him O
the O
slave O
of O
his O
designing O
friends O
, O
and O
led O
him O
to O
sacrifice O
his O
own O
happiness O
to O
the O
caprice O
of O
their O
inclinations O
. O
Had O
his O
own O
happiness O
, O
however O
, O
been O
the O
only O
sacrifice O
, O
he O
might O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
sport O
with O
it O
in O
whatever O
manner O
he O
thought O
best O
; O
but O
her O
sister O
's O
was O
involved O
in O
it O
, O
as O
she O
thought O
he O
must O
be O
sensible O
himself O
. O
It O
was O
a O
subject O
, O
in O
short O
, O
on O
which O
reflection O
would O
be O
long O
indulged O
, O
and O
must O
be O
unavailing O
. O
She O
could O
think O
of O
nothing O
else O
; O
and O
yet O
, O
whether O
Bingley O
's O
regard O
had O
really O
died O
away O
, O
or O
were O
suppressed O
by O
his O
friends O
' O
interference O
; O
whether O
he O
had O
been O
aware O
of O
Jane O
's O
attachment O
, O
or O
whether O
it O
had O
escaped O
his O
observation O
; O
whichever O
were O
the O
case O
, O
though O
her O
opinion O
of O
him O
must O
be O
materially O
affected O
by O
the O
difference O
, O
her O
sister O
's O
situation O
remained O
the O
same O
, O
her O
peace O
equally O
wounded O
. O
A O
day O
or O
two O
passed O
before O
Jane O
had O
courage O
to O
speak O
of O
her O
feelings O
to O
Elizabeth O
; O
but O
at O
last O
, O
on O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
leaving O
them O
together O
, O
after O
a O
longer O
irritation O
than O
usual O
about O
Netherfield O
and O
its O
master O
, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
saying O
, O
-- O
" O
O O
that O
my O
dear O
mother O
had O
more O
command O
over O
herself O
! O
she O
can O
have O
no O
idea O
of O
the O
pain O
she O
gives O
me O
by O
her O
continual O
reflections O
on O
him O
. O
But O
I O
will O
not O
repine O
. O
It O
can O
not O
last O
long O
. O
He O
will O
be O
forgot O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
all O
be O
as O
we O
were O
before O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
looked O
at O
her O
sister O
with O
incredulous O
solicitude O
, O
but O
said O
nothing O
. O
" O
You O
doubt O
me O
, O
" O
cried O
Jane O
, O
slightly O
colouring O
; O
" O
indeed O
, O
you O
have O
no O
reason O
. O
He O
may O
live O
in O
my O
memory O
as O
the O
most O
amiable O
man O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
but O
that O
is O
all O
. O
I O
have O
nothing O
either O
to O
hope O
or O
fear O
, O
and O
nothing O
to O
reproach O
him O
with O
. O
Thank O
God O
I O
have O
not O
_that_ O
pain O
. O
A O
little O
time O
, O
therefore O
-- O
I O
shall O
certainly O
try O
to O
get O
the O
better O
-- O
-- O
" O
With O
a O
stronger O
voice O
she O
soon O
added O
, O
" O
I O
have O
this O
comfort O
immediately O
, O
that O
it O
has O
not O
been O
more O
than O
an O
error O
of O
fancy O
on O
my O
side O
, O
and O
that O
it O
has O
done O
no O
harm O
to O
anyone O
but O
myself O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Jane O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
you O
are O
too O
good O
. O
Your O
sweetness O
and O
disinterestedness O
are O
really O
angelic O
; O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
to O
say O
to O
you O
. O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
had O
never O
done O
you O
justice O
, O
or O
loved O
you O
as O
you O
deserve O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
eagerly O
disclaimed O
all O
extraordinary O
merit O
, O
and O
threw O
back O
the O
praise O
on O
her O
sister O
's O
warm O
affection O
. O
" O
Nay O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
this O
is O
not O
fair O
. O
_You_ O
wish O
to O
think O
all O
the O
world O
respectable O
, O
and O
are O
hurt O
if O
I O
speak O
ill O
of O
anybody O
. O
_I_ O
only O
want O
to O
think O
_you_ O
perfect O
, O
and O
you O
set O
yourself O
against O
it O
. O
Do O
not O
be O
afraid O
of O
my O
running O
into O
any O
excess O
, O
of O
my O
encroaching O
on O
your O
privilege O
of O
universal O
good-will O
. O
You O
need O
not O
. O
There O
are O
few O
people O
whom O
I O
really O
love O
, O
and O
still O
fewer O
of O
whom O
I O
think O
well O
. O
The O
more O
I O
see O
of O
the O
world O
the O
more O
am O
I O
dissatisfied O
with O
it O
; O
and O
every O
day O
confirms O
my O
belief O
of O
the O
inconsistency O
of O
all O
human O
characters O
, O
and O
of O
the O
little O
dependence O
that O
can O
be O
placed O
on O
the O
appearance O
of O
either O
merit O
or O
sense O
. O
I O
have O
met O
with O
two O
instances O
lately O
: O
one O
I O
will O
not O
mention O
, O
the O
other O
is O
Charlotte O
's O
marriage O
. O
It O
is O
unaccountable O
! O
in O
every O
view O
it O
is O
unaccountable O
! O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
do O
not O
give O
way O
to O
such O
feelings O
as O
these O
. O
They O
will O
ruin O
your O
happiness O
. O
You O
do O
not O
make O
allowance O
enough O
for O
difference O
of O
situation O
and O
temper O
. O
Consider O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
respectability O
, O
and O
Charlotte O
's O
prudent O
, O
steady O
character O
. O
Remember O
that O
she O
is O
one O
of O
a O
large O
family O
; O
that O
as O
to O
fortune O
it O
is O
a O
most O
eligible O
match O
; O
and O
be O
ready O
to O
believe O
, O
for O
everybody O
's O
sake O
, O
that O
she O
may O
feel O
something O
like O
regard O
and O
esteem O
for O
our O
cousin O
. O
" O
" O
To O
oblige O
you O
, O
I O
would O
try O
to O
believe O
almost O
anything O
, O
but O
no O
one O
else O
could O
be O
benefited O
by O
such O
a O
belief O
as O
this O
; O
for O
were O
I O
persuaded O
that O
Charlotte O
had O
any O
regard O
for O
him O
, O
I O
should O
only O
think O
worse O
of O
her O
understanding O
than O
I O
now O
do O
of O
her O
heart O
. O
My O
dear O
Jane O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
is O
a O
conceited O
, O
pompous O
, O
narrow-minded O
, O
silly O
man O
: O
you O
know O
he O
is O
, O
as O
well O
as O
I O
do O
; O
and O
you O
must O
feel O
, O
as O
well O
as O
I O
do O
, O
that O
the O
woman O
who O
marries O
him O
can O
not O
have O
a O
proper O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O
You O
shall O
not O
defend O
her O
, O
though O
it O
is O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
. O
You O
shall O
not O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
one O
individual O
, O
change O
the O
meaning O
of O
principle O
and O
integrity O
, O
nor O
endeavour O
to O
persuade O
yourself O
or O
me O
, O
that O
selfishness O
is O
prudence O
, O
and O
insensibility O
of O
danger O
security O
for O
happiness O
. O
" O
" O
I O
must O
think O
your O
language O
too O
strong O
in O
speaking O
of O
both O
, O
" O
replied O
Jane O
; O
" O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
be O
convinced O
of O
it O
, O
by O
seeing O
them O
happy O
together O
. O
But O
enough O
of O
this O
. O
You O
alluded O
to O
something O
else O
. O
You O
mentioned O
_two_ O
instances O
. O
I O
can O
not O
misunderstand O
you O
, O
but O
I O
entreat O
you O
, O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
not O
to O
pain O
me O
by O
thinking O
_that O
person_ O
to O
blame O
, O
and O
saying O
your O
opinion O
of O
him O
is O
sunk O
. O
We O
must O
not O
be O
so O
ready O
to O
fancy O
ourselves O
intentionally O
injured O
. O
We O
must O
not O
expect O
a O
lively O
young O
man O
to O
be O
always O
so O
guarded O
and O
circumspect O
. O
It O
is O
very O
often O
nothing O
but O
our O
own O
vanity O
that O
deceives O
us O
. O
Women O
fancy O
admiration O
means O
more O
than O
it O
does O
. O
" O
" O
And O
men O
take O
care O
that O
they O
should O
. O
" O
" O
If O
it O
is O
designedly O
done O
, O
they O
can O
not O
be O
justified O
; O
but O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
of O
there O
being O
so O
much O
design O
in O
the O
world O
as O
some O
persons O
imagine O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
far O
from O
attributing O
any O
part O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
conduct O
to O
design O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
but O
, O
without O
scheming O
to O
do O
wrong O
, O
or O
to O
make O
others O
unhappy O
, O
there O
may O
be O
error O
and O
there O
may O
be O
misery O
. O
Thoughtlessness O
, O
want O
of O
attention O
to O
other O
people O
's O
feelings O
, O
and O
want O
of O
resolution O
, O
will O
do O
the O
business O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
impute O
it O
to O
either O
of O
those O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
to O
the O
last O
. O
But O
if O
I O
go O
on O
I O
shall O
displease O
you O
by O
saying O
what O
I O
think O
of O
persons O
you O
esteem O
. O
Stop O
me O
, O
whilst O
you O
can O
. O
" O
" O
You O
persist O
, O
then O
, O
in O
supposing O
his O
sisters O
influence O
him O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
in O
conjunction O
with O
his O
friend O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
believe O
it O
. O
Why O
should O
they O
try O
to O
influence O
him O
? O
They O
can O
only O
wish O
his O
happiness O
; O
and O
if O
he O
is O
attached O
to O
me O
no O
other O
woman O
can O
secure O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
first O
position O
is O
false O
. O
They O
may O
wish O
many O
things O
besides O
his O
happiness O
: O
they O
may O
wish O
his O
increase O
of O
wealth O
and O
consequence O
; O
they O
may O
wish O
him O
to O
marry O
a O
girl O
who O
has O
all O
the O
importance O
of O
money O
, O
great O
connections O
, O
and O
pride O
. O
" O
" O
Beyond O
a O
doubt O
they O
do O
wish O
him O
to O
choose O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
" O
replied O
Jane O
; O
" O
but O
this O
may O
be O
from O
better O
feelings O
than O
you O
are O
supposing O
. O
They O
have O
known O
her O
much O
longer O
than O
they O
have O
known O
me O
; O
no O
wonder O
if O
they O
love O
her O
better O
. O
But O
, O
whatever O
may O
be O
their O
own O
wishes O
, O
it O
is O
very O
unlikely O
they O
should O
have O
opposed O
their O
brother O
's O
. O
What O
sister O
would O
think O
herself O
at O
liberty O
to O
do O
it O
, O
unless O
there O
were O
something O
very O
objectionable O
? O
If O
they O
believed O
him O
attached O
to O
me O
they O
would O
not O
try O
to O
part O
us O
; O
if O
he O
were O
so O
, O
they O
could O
not O
succeed O
. O
By O
supposing O
such O
an O
affection O
, O
you O
make O
everybody O
acting O
unnaturally O
and O
wrong O
, O
and O
me O
most O
unhappy O
. O
Do O
not O
distress O
me O
by O
the O
idea O
. O
I O
am O
not O
ashamed O
of O
having O
been O
mistaken O
-- O
or O
, O
at O
least O
, O
it O
is O
slight O
, O
it O
is O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
of O
what O
I O
should O
feel O
in O
thinking O
ill O
of O
him O
or O
his O
sisters O
. O
Let O
me O
take O
it O
in O
the O
best O
light O
, O
in O
the O
light O
in O
which O
it O
may O
be O
understood O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
oppose O
such O
a O
wish O
; O
and O
from O
this O
time O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
name O
was O
scarcely O
ever O
mentioned O
between O
them O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
still O
continued O
to O
wonder O
and O
repine O
at O
his O
returning O
no O
more O
; O
and O
though O
a O
day O
seldom O
passed O
in O
which O
Elizabeth O
did O
not O
account O
for O
it O
clearly O
, O
there O
seemed O
little O
chance O
of O
her O
ever O
considering O
it O
with O
less O
perplexity O
. O
Her O
daughter O
endeavoured O
to O
convince O
her O
of O
what O
she O
did O
not O
believe O
herself O
, O
that O
his O
attentions O
to O
Jane O
had O
been O
merely O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
common O
and O
transient O
liking O
, O
which O
ceased O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
no O
more O
; O
but O
though O
the O
probability O
of O
the O
statement O
was O
admitted O
at O
the O
time O
, O
she O
had O
the O
same O
story O
to O
repeat O
every O
day O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
best O
comfort O
was O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Bingley O
must O
be O
down O
again O
in O
the O
summer O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
treated O
the O
matter O
differently O
. O
" O
So O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
one O
day O
, O
" O
your O
sister O
is O
crossed O
in O
love O
, O
I O
find O
. O
I O
congratulate O
her O
. O
Next O
to O
being O
married O
, O
a O
girl O
likes O
to O
be O
crossed O
in O
love O
a O
little O
now O
and O
then O
. O
It O
is O
something O
to O
think O
of O
, O
and O
gives O
her O
a O
sort O
of O
distinction O
among O
her O
companions O
. O
When O

of O
the O
Longbourn O
family O
