The O
discussion O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
offer O
was O
now O
nearly O
at O
an O
end O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
had O
only O
to O
suffer O
from O
the O
uncomfortable O
feelings O
necessarily O
attending O
it O
, O
and O
occasionally O
from O
some O
peevish O
allusion O
of O
her O
mother O
. O
As O
for O
the O
gentleman O
himself O
, O
_his_ O
feelings O
were O
chiefly O
expressed O
, O
not O
by O
embarrassment O
or O
dejection O
, O
or O
by O
trying O
to O
avoid O
her O
, O
but O
by O
stiffness O
of O
manner O
and O
resentful O
silence O
. O
He O
scarcely O
ever O
spoke O
to O
her O
; O
and O
the O
assiduous O
attentions O
which O
he O
had O
been O
so O
sensible O
of O
himself O
were O
transferred O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
to O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
whose O
civility O
in O
listening O
to O
him O
was O
a O
seasonable O
relief O
to O
them O
all O
, O
and O
especially O
to O
her O
friend O
. O
The O
morrow O
produced O
no O
abatement O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
ill O
humour O
or O
ill O
health O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
also O
in O
the O
same O
state O
of O
angry O
pride O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
hoped O
that O
his O
resentment O
might O
shorten O
his O
visit O
, O
but O
his O
plan O
did O
not O
appear O
in O
the O
least O
affected O
by O
it O
. O
He O
was O
always O
to O
have O
gone O
on O
Saturday O
, O
and O
to O
Saturday O
he O
still O
meant O
to O
stay O
. O
After O
breakfast O
, O
the O
girls O
walked O
to O
Meryton O
, O
to O
inquire O
if O
Mr. O
Wickham O
were O
returned O
, O
and O
to O
lament O
over O
his O
absence O
from O
the O
Netherfield O
ball O
. O
He O
joined O
them O
on O
their O
entering O
the O
town O
, O
and O
attended O
them O
to O
their O
aunt O
's O
, O
where O
his O
regret O
and O
vexation O
and O
the O
concern O
of O
everybody O
were O
well O
talked O
over O
. O
To O
Elizabeth O
, O
however O
, O
he O
voluntarily O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
necessity O
of O
his O
absence O
_had_ O
been O
self-imposed O
. O
" O
I O
found O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
as O
the O
time O
drew O
near O
, O
that O
I O
had O
better O
not O
meet O
Mr. O
Darcy O
; O
-- O
that O
to O
be O
in O
the O
same O
room O
, O
the O
same O
party O
with O
him O
for O
so O
many O
hours O
together O
, O
might O
be O
more O
than O
I O
could O
bear O
, O
and O
that O
scenes O
might O
arise O
unpleasant O
to O
more O
than O
myself O
. O
" O
She O
highly O
approved O
his O
forbearance O
; O
and O
they O
had O
leisure O
for O
a O
full O
discussion O
of O
it O
, O
and O
for O
all O
the O
commendations O
which O
they O
civilly O
bestowed O
on O
each O
other O
, O
as O
Wickham O
and O
another O
officer O
walked O
back O
with O
them O
to O
Longbourn O
, O
and O
during O
the O
walk O
he O
particularly O
attended O
to O
her O
. O
His O
accompanying O
them O
was O
a O
double O
advantage O
: O
she O
felt O
all O
the O
compliment O
it O
offered O
to O
herself O
; O
and O
it O
was O
most O
acceptable O
as O
an O
occasion O
of O
introducing O
him O
to O
her O
father O
and O
mother O
. O
Soon O
after O
their O
return O
, O
a O
letter O
was O
delivered O
to O
Miss O
Bennet O
; O
it O
came O
from O
Netherfield O
, O
and O
was O
opened O
immediately O
. O
The O
envelope O
contained O
a O
sheet O
of O
elegant O
, O
little O
, O
hot-pressed O
paper O
, O
well O
covered O
with O
a O
lady O
's O
fair O
, O
flowing O
hand O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
saw O
her O
sister O
's O
countenance O
change O
as O
she O
read O
it O
, O
and O
saw O
her O
dwelling O
intently O
on O
some O
particular O
passages O
. O
Jane O
recollected O
herself O
soon O
; O
and O
putting O
the O
letter O
away O
, O
tried O
to O
join O
, O
with O
her O
usual O
cheerfulness O
, O
in O
the O
general O
conversation O
: O
but O
Elizabeth O
felt O
an O
anxiety O
on O
the O
subject O
which O
drew O
off O
her O
attention O
even O
from O
Wickham O
; O
and O
no O
sooner O
had O
he O
and O
his O
companion O
taken O
leave O
, O
than O
a O
glance O
from O
Jane O
invited O
her O
to O
follow O
her O
upstairs O
. O
When O
they O
had O
gained O
their O
own O
room O
, O
Jane O
, O
taking O
out O
her O
letter O
, O
said O
, O
" O
This O
is O
from O
Caroline O
Bingley O
: O
what O
it O
contains O
has O
surprised O
me O
a O
good O
deal O
. O
The O
whole O
party O
have O
left O
Netherfield O
by O
this O
time O
, O
and O
are O
on O
their O
way O
to O
town O
; O
and O
without O
any O
intention O
of O
coming O
back O
again O
. O
You O
shall O
hear O
what O
she O
says O
. O
" O
She O
then O
read O
the O
first O
sentence O
aloud O
, O
which O
comprised O
the O
information O
of O
their O
having O
just O
resolved O
to O
follow O
their O
brother O
to O
town O
directly O
, O
and O
of O
their O
meaning O
to O
dine O
that O
day O
in O
Grosvenor O
Street O
, O
where O
Mr O
. O
Hurst O
had O
a O
house O
. O
The O
next O
was O
in O
these O
words O
: O
-- O
" O
' O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
regret O
anything O
I O
shall O
leave O
in O
Hertfordshire O
except O
your O
society O
, O
my O
dearest O
friend O
; O
but O
we O
will O
hope O
, O
at O
some O
future O
period O
, O
to O
enjoy O
many O
returns O
of O
that O
delightful O
intercourse O
we O
have O
known O
, O
and O
in O
the O
meanwhile O
may O
lessen O
the O
pain O
of O
separation O
by O
a O
very O
frequent O
and O
most O
unreserved O
correspondence O
. O
I O
depend O
on O
you O
for O
that O
. O
' O
" O
To O
these O
high-flown O
expressions O
Elizabeth O
listened O
with O
all O
the O
insensibility O
of O
distrust O
; O
and O
though O
the O
suddenness O
of O
their O
removal O
surprised O
her O
, O
she O
saw O
nothing O
in O
it O
really O
to O
lament O
: O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
their O
absence O
from O
Netherfield O
would O
prevent O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
being O
there O
; O
and O
as O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
their O
society O
, O
she O
was O
persuaded O
that O
Jane O
must O
soon O
cease O
to O
regard O
it O
in O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
his O
. O
" O
It O
is O
unlucky O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
after O
a O
short O
pause O
, O
" O
that O
you O
should O
not O
be O
able O
to O
see O
your O
friends O
before O
they O
leave O
the O
country O
. O
But O
may O
we O
not O
hope O
that O
the O
period O
of O
future O
happiness O
, O
to O
which O
Miss O
Bingley O
looks O
forward O
, O
may O
arrive O
earlier O
than O
she O
is O
aware O
, O
and O
that O
the O
delightful O
intercourse O
you O
have O
known O
as O
friends O
will O
be O
renewed O
with O
yet O
greater O
satisfaction O
as O
sisters O
? O
Mr. O
Bingley O
will O
not O
be O
detained O
in O
London O
by O
them O
. O
" O
" O
Caroline O
decidedly O
says O
that O
none O
of O
the O
party O
will O
return O
into O
Hertfordshire O
this O
winter O
. O
I O
will O
read O
it O
to O
you O
. O
" O
'When O
my O
brother O
left O
us O
yesterday O
, O
he O
imagined O
that O
the O
business O
which O
took O
him O
to O
London O
might O
be O
concluded O
in O
three O
or O
four O
days O
; O
but O
as O
we O
are O
certain O
it O
can O
not O
be O
so O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
convinced O
that O
when O
Charles O
gets O
to O
town O
he O
will O
be O
in O
no O
hurry O
to O
leave O
it O
again O
, O
we O
have O
determined O
on O
following O
him O
thither O
, O
that O
he O
may O
not O
be O
obliged O
to O
spend O
his O
vacant O
hours O
in O
a O
comfortless O
hotel O
. O
Many O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
are O
already O
there O
for O
the O
winter O
: O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
hear O
that O
you O
, O
my O
dearest O
friend O
, O
had O
any O
intention O
of O
making O
one O
in O
the O
crowd O
, O
but O
of O
that O
I O
despair O
. O
I O
sincerely O
hope O
your O
Christmas O
in O
Hertfordshire O
may O
abound O
in O
the O
gaieties O
which O
that O
season O
generally O
brings O
, O
and O
that O
your O
beaux O
will O
be O
so O
numerous O
as O
to O
prevent O
your O
feeling O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
three O
of O
whom O
we O
shall O
deprive O
you O
. O
' O
" O
It O
is O
evident O
by O
this O
, O
" O
added O
Jane O
, O
" O
that O
he O
comes O
back O
no O
more O
this O
winter O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
only O
evident O
that O
Miss O
Bingley O
does O
not O
mean O
he O
_should_ O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
will O
you O
think O
so O
? O
It O
must O
be O
his O
own O
doing O
; O
he O
is O
his O
own O
master O
. O
But O
you O
do O
not O
know O
_all_ O
. O
I O
_will_ O
read O
you O
the O
passage O
which O
particularly O
hurts O
me O
. O
I O
will O
have O
no O
reserves O
from O
_you_ O
. O
'Mr O
. O
Darcy O
is O
impatient O
to O
see O
his O
sister O
; O
and O
to O
confess O
the O
truth O
, O
_we_ O
are O
scarcely O
less O
eager O
to O
meet O
her O
again O
. O
I O
really O
do O
not O
think O
Georgiana O
Darcy O
has O
her O
equal O
for O
beauty O
, O
elegance O
, O
and O
accomplishments O
; O
and O
the O
affection O
she O
inspires O
in O
Louisa O
and O
myself O
is O
heightened O
into O
something O
still O
more O
interesting O
from O
the O
hope O
we O
dare O
to O
entertain O
of O
her O
being O
hereafter O
our O
sister O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
I O
ever O
before O
mentioned O
to O
you O
my O
feelings O
on O
this O
subject O
, O
but O
I O
will O
not O
leave O
the O
country O
without O
confiding O
them O
, O
and O
I O
trust O
you O
will O
not O
esteem O
them O
unreasonable O
. O
My O
brother O
admires O
her O
greatly O
already O
; O
he O
will O
have O
frequent O
opportunity O
now O
of O
seeing O
her O
on O
the O
most O
intimate O
footing O
; O
her O
relations O
all O
wish O
the O
connection O
as O
much O
as O
his O
own O
; O
and O
a O
sister O
's O
partiality O
is O
not O
misleading O
me O
, O
I O
think O
, O
when O
I O
call O
Charles O
most O
capable O
of O
engaging O
any O
woman O
's O
heart O
. O
With O
all O
these O
circumstances O
to O
favour O
an O
attachment O
, O
and O
nothing O
to O
prevent O
it O
, O
am O
I O
wrong O
, O
my O
dearest O
Jane O
, O
in O
indulging O
the O
hope O
of O
an O
event O
which O
will O
secure O
the O
happiness O
of O
so O
many O
? O
' O
What O
think O
you O
of O
_this_ O
sentence O
, O
my O
dear O
Lizzy O
? O
" O
said O
Jane O
, O
as O
she O
finished O
it O
. O
" O
Is O
it O
not O
clear O
enough O
? O
Does O
it O
not O
expressly O
declare O
that O
Caroline O
neither O
expects O
nor O
wishes O
me O
to O
be O
her O
sister O
; O
that O
she O
is O
perfectly O
convinced O
of O
her O
brother O
's O
indifference O
; O
and O
that O
if O
she O
suspects O
the O
nature O
of O
my O
feelings O
for O
him O
she O
means O
( O
most O
kindly O
! O
) O
to O
put O
me O
on O
my O
guard O
. O
Can O
there O
be O
any O
other O
opinion O
on O
the O
subject O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
there O
can O
; O
for O
mine O
is O
totally O
different O
. O
Will O
you O
hear O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Most O
willingly O
. O
" O
" O
You O
shall O
have O
it O
in O
a O
few O
words O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
sees O
that O
her O
brother O
is O
in O
love O
with O
you O
and O
wants O
him O
to O
marry O
Miss O
Darcy O
. O
She O
follows O
him O
to O
town O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
keeping O
him O
there O
, O
and O
tries O
to O
persuade O
you O
that O
he O
does O
not O
care O
about O
you O
. O
" O
Jane O
shook O
her O
head O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
Jane O
, O
you O
ought O
to O
believe O
me O
. O
No O
one O
who O
has O
ever O
seen O
you O
together O
can O
doubt O
his O
affection O
; O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
can O
not O
: O
she O
is O
not O
such O
a O
simpleton O
. O
Could O
she O
have O
seen O
half O
as O
much O
love O
in O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
for O
herself O
, O
she O
would O
have O
ordered O
her O
wedding O
clothes O
. O
But O
the O
case O
is O
this O
: O
-- O
we O
are O
not O
rich O
enough O
or O
grand O
enough O
for O
them O
; O
and O
she O
is O
the O
more O
anxious O
to O
get O
Miss O
Darcy O
for O
her O
brother O
, O
from O
the O
notion O
that O
when O
there O
has O
been O
_one_ O
inter-marriage O
, O
she O
may O
have O
less O
trouble O
in O
achieving O
a O
second O
; O
in O
which O
there O
is O
certainly O
some O
ingenuity O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
it O
would O
succeed O
if O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
were O
out O
of O
the O
way O
. O
But O
, O
my O
dearest O
Jane O
, O
you O
can O
not O
seriously O
imagine O
that O
, O
because O
Miss O
Bingley O
tells O
you O
her O
brother O
greatly O
admires O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
he O
is O
in O
the O
smallest O
degree O
less O
sensible O
of O
_your_ O
merit O
than O
when O
he O
took O
leave O
of O
you O
on O
Tuesday O
; O
or O
that O
it O
will O
be O
in O
her O
power O
to O
persuade O
him O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
in O
love O
with O
you O
, O
he O
is O
very O
much O
in O
love O
with O
her O
friend O
. O
" O
" O
If O
we O
thought O
alike O
of O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
" O
replied O
Jane O
, O
" O
your O
representation O
of O
all O
this O
might O
make O
me O
quite O
easy O
. O
But O
I O
know O
the O
foundation O
is O
unjust O
. O
Caroline O
is O
incapable O
of O
wilfully O
deceiving O
anyone O
; O
and O
all O
that O
I O
can O
hope O
in O
this O
case O
is O
, O
that O
she O
is O
deceived O
herself O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
right O
. O
You O
could O
not O
have O
started O
a O
more O
happy O
idea O
, O
since O
you O
will O
not O
take O
comfort O
in O
mine O
: O
believe O
her O
to O
be O
deceived O
, O
by O
all O
means O
. O
You O
have O
now O
done O
your O
duty O
by O
her O
, O
and O
must O
fret O
no O
longer O
. O
" O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
, O
can O
I O
be O
happy O
, O
even O
supposing O
the O
best O
, O
in O
accepting O
a O
man O
whose O
sisters O
and O
friends O
are O
all O
wishing O
him O
to O
marry O
elsewhere O
? O
" O
" O
You O
must O
decide O
for O
yourself O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
and O
if O
, O
upon O
mature O
deliberation O
, O
you O
find O
that O
the O
misery O
of O
disobliging O
his O
two O
sisters O
is O
more O
than O
equivalent O
to O
the O
happiness O
of O
being O
his O
wife O
, O
I O
advise O
you O
, O
by O
all O
means O
, O
to O
refuse O
him O
. O
" O
" O
How O
can O
you O
talk O
so O
? O
" O
said O
Jane O
, O
faintly O
smiling O
; O
" O
you O
must O
know O
, O
that O
, O
though O
I O
should O
be O
exceedingly O
grieved O
at O
their O
disapprobation O
, O
I O
could O
not O
hesitate O

" O
" O
I O
did O
not O
think O
you O
would O
; O
and O
that O
being O
the O
case O
, O
I O
can O
not O
consider O
your O
situation O
with O
much O
compassion O
. O
" O
" O
But O
if O
he O
returns O
no O
more O
this O
winter O
, O
my O
choice O
will O
never O
be O
required O

thousand O
things O

" O
The O
idea O
of O
his O
returning O
no O
more O
Elizabeth O
treated O
with O
the O
utmost O
contempt O
. O
It O
appeared O
to O
her O
merely O
the O
suggestion O
of O
Caroline O
's O
interested O
wishes O
; O
and O
she O
could O
not O
for O
a O
moment O
suppose O
that O
those O
wishes O
, O
however O
openly O
or O
artfully O
spoken O
, O
could O
influence O
a O
young O
man O
so O
totally O
independent O
of O
everyone O
. O
She O
represented O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
as O
forcibly O
as O
possible O
, O
what O
she O
felt O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
had O
soon O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
its O
happy O
effect O
. O
Jane O
's O
temper O
was O
not O
desponding O
; O
and O
she O
was O
gradually O
led O
to O
hope O
, O
though O
the O
diffidence O
of O
affection O
sometimes O
overcame O
the O
hope O
, O
that O
Bingley O
would O
return O
to O
Netherfield O
, O
and O
answer O
every O
wish O
of O
her O
heart O
. O
They O
agreed O
that O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
should O
only O
hear O
of O
the O
departure O
of O
the O
family O
, O
without O
being O
alarmed O
on O
the O
score O
of O
the O
gentleman O
's O
conduct O
; O
but O
even O
this O
partial O
communication O
gave O
her O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
concern O
, O
and O
she O
bewailed O
it O
as O
exceedingly O
unlucky O
that O
the O
ladies O
should O
happen O
to O
go O
away O
just O
as O
they O
were O
all O
getting O
so O
intimate O
together O
. O
After O
lamenting O
it O
, O
however O
, O
at O
some O
length O
, O
she O
had O
the O
consolation O
of O
thinking O
that O
Mr. O
Bingley O
would O
be O
soon O
down O
again O
, O
and O
soon O
dining O
at O
Longbourn O
; O
and O
the O
conclusion O
of O
all O
was O
the O
comfortable O
declaration O
, O
that O
, O
though O
he O
had O
been O
invited O
only O
to O
a O
family O
dinner O
, O
she O
would O
take O
care O
to O
have O
two O
full O
courses O
. O
