CHAPTER O
I O
. O
It O
is O
a O
truth O
universally O
acknowledged O
, O
that O
a O
single O
man O
in O
possession O
of O
a O
good O
fortune O
must O
be O
in O
want O
of O
a O
wife O
. O
However O
little O
known O
the O
feelings O
or O
views O
of O
such O
a O
man O
may O
be O
on O
his O
first O
entering O
a O
neighbourhood O
, O
this O
truth O
is O
so O
well O
fixed O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
surrounding O
families O
, O
that O
he O
is O
considered O
as O
the O
rightful O
property O
of O
some O
one O
or O
other O
of O
their O
daughters O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
said O
his O
lady O
to O
him O
one O
day O
, O
" O
have O
you O
heard O
that O
Netherfield O
Park O
is O
let O
at O
last O
? O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
replied O
that O
he O
had O
not O
. O
" O
But O
it O
is O
, O
" O
returned O
she O
; O
" O
for O
Mrs. O
Long O
has O
just O
been O
here O
, O
and O
she O
told O
me O
all O
about O
it O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
" O
Do O
not O
you O
want O
to O
know O
who O
has O
taken O
it O
? O
" O
cried O
his O
wife O
, O
impatiently O
. O
" O
_You_ O
want O
to O
tell O
me O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
hearing O
it O
. O
" O
This O
was O
invitation O
enough O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
must O
know O
, O
Mrs. O
Long O
says O
that O
Netherfield O
is O
taken O
by O
a O
young O
man O
of O
large O
fortune O
from O
the O
north O
of O
England O
; O
that O
he O
came O
down O
on O
Monday O
in O
a O
chaise O
and O
four O
to O
see O
the O
place O
, O
and O
was O
so O
much O
delighted O
with O
it O
that O
he O
agreed O
with O
Mr. O
Morris O
immediately O
; O
that O
he O
is O
to O
take O
possession O
before O
Michaelmas O
, O
and O
some O
of O
his O
servants O
are O
to O
be O
in O
the O
house O
by O
the O
end O
of O
next O
week O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
his O
name O
? O
" O
" O
Bingley O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
he O
married O
or O
single O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
single O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
! O
A O
single O
man O
of O
large O
fortune O
; O
four O
or O
five O
thousand O
a O
year O
. O
What O
a O
fine O
thing O
for O
our O
girls O
! O
" O
" O
How O
so O
? O
how O
can O
it O
affect O
them O
? O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
replied O
his O
wife O
, O
" O
how O
can O
you O
be O
so O
tiresome O
? O
You O
must O
know O
that O
I O
am O
thinking O
of O
his O
marrying O
one O
of O
them O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
that O
his O
design O
in O
settling O
here O
? O
" O
" O
Design O
? O
Nonsense O
, O
how O
can O
you O
talk O
so O
! O
But O
it O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
he O
_may_ O
fall O
in O
love O
with O
one O
of O
them O
, O
and O
therefore O
you O
must O
visit O
him O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
comes O
. O
" O
" O
I O
see O
no O
occasion O
for O
that O
. O
You O
and O
the O
girls O
may O
go O
-- O
or O
you O
may O
send O
them O
by O
themselves O
, O
which O
perhaps O
will O
be O
still O
better O
; O
for O
as O
you O
are O
as O
handsome O
as O
any O
of O
them O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
might O
like O
you O
the O
best O
of O
the O
party O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
you O
flatter O
me O
. O
I O
certainly O
_have_ O
had O
my O
share O
of O
beauty O
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
be O
anything O
extraordinary O
now O
. O
When O
a O
woman O
has O
five O
grown-up O
daughters O
, O
she O
ought O
to O
give O
over O
thinking O
of O
her O
own O
beauty O
. O
" O
" O
In O
such O
cases O
, O
a O
woman O
has O
not O
often O
much O
beauty O
to O
think O
of O
. O
" O
" O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
you O
must O
indeed O
go O
and O
see O
Mr. O
Bingley O
when O
he O
comes O
into O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
more O
than O
I O
engage O
for O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
. O
" O
" O
But O
consider O
your O
daughters O
. O
Only O
think O
what O
an O
establishment O
it O
would O
be O
for O
one O
of O
them O
. O
Sir O
William O
and O
Lady O
Lucas O
are O
determined O
to O
go O
, O
merely O
on O
that O
account O
; O
for O
in O
general O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
visit O
no O
new O
comers O
. O
Indeed O
you O
must O
go O
, O
for O
it O
will O
be O
impossible O
for O
_us_ O
to O
visit O
him O
, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
over O
scrupulous O
, O
surely O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
Mr. O
Bingley O
will O
be O
very O
glad O
to O
see O
you O
; O
and O
I O
will O
send O
a O
few O
lines O
by O
you O
to O
assure O
him O
of O
my O
hearty O
consent O
to O
his O
marrying O
whichever O
he O
chooses O
of O
the O
girls O
-- O
though O
I O
must O
throw O
in O
a O
good O
word O
for O
my O
little O
Lizzy O
. O
" O
" O
I O
desire O
you O
will O
do O
no O
such O
thing O
. O
Lizzy O
is O
not O
a O
bit O
better O
than O
the O
others O
: O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
is O
not O
half O
so O
handsome O
as O
Jane O
, O
nor O
half O
so O
good-humoured O
as O
Lydia O
. O
But O
you O
are O
always O
giving O
_her_ O
the O
preference O
. O
" O
" O
They O
have O
none O
of O
them O
much O
to O
recommend O
them O
, O
" O
replied O
he O
: O
" O
they O
are O
all O
silly O
and O
ignorant O
like O
other O
girls O
; O
but O
Lizzy O
has O
something O
more O
of O
quickness O
than O
her O
sisters O
. O
" O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
how O
can O
you O
abuse O
your O
own O
children O
in O
such O
a O
way O
? O
You O
take O
delight O
in O
vexing O
me O
. O
You O
have O
no O
compassion O
on O
my O
poor O
nerves O
. O
" O
" O
You O
mistake O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
I O
have O
a O
high O
respect O
for O
your O
nerves O
. O
They O
are O
my O
old O
friends O
. O
I O
have O
heard O
you O
mention O
them O
with O
consideration O
these O
twenty O
years O
at O
least O
. O
" O
" O
Ah O
, O
you O
do O
not O
know O
what O
I O
suffer O
. O
" O
" O
But O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
get O
over O
it O
, O
and O
live O
to O
see O
many O
young O
men O
of O
four O
thousand O
a O
year O
come O
into O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O
" O
" O
It O
will O
be O
no O
use O
to O
us O
, O
if O
twenty O
such O
should O
come O
, O
since O
you O
will O
not O
visit O
them O
. O
" O
" O
Depend O
upon O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
that O
when O
there O
are O
twenty O
, O
I O
will O
visit O
them O
all O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
so O
odd O
a O
mixture O
of O
quick O
parts O
, O
sarcastic O
humour O
, O
reserve O
, O
and O
caprice O
, O
that O
the O
experience O
of O
three-and-twenty O
years O
had O
been O
insufficient O
to O
make O
his O
wife O
understand O
his O
character O
. O
_Her_ O
mind O
was O
less O
difficult O
to O
develope O
. O
She O
was O
a O
woman O
of O
mean O
understanding O
, O
little O
information O
, O
and O
uncertain O
temper O
. O
When O
she O
was O
discontented O
, O
she O
fancied O
herself O
nervous O
. O
The O
business O
of O
her O
life O
was O
to O
get O
her O
daughters O
married O
: O
its O
solace O
was O
visiting O
and O
news O
. O
