One O
morning O
, O
about O
a O
week O
after O
Bingley O
's O
engagement O
with O
Jane O
had O
been O
formed O
, O
as O
he O
and O
the O
females O
of O
the O
family O
were O
sitting O
together O
in O
the O
dining-room O
, O
their O
attention O
was O
suddenly O
drawn O
to O
the O
window O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
carriage O
; O
and O
they O
perceived O
a O
chaise O
and O
four O
driving O
up O
the O
lawn O
. O
It O
was O
too O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
for O
visitors O
; O
and O
besides O
, O
the O
equipage O
did O
not O
answer O
to O
that O
of O
any O
of O
their O
neighbours O
. O
The O
horses O
were O
post O
; O
and O
neither O
the O
carriage O
, O
nor O
the O
livery O
of O
the O
servant O
who O
preceded O
it O
, O
were O
familiar O
to O
them O
. O
As O
it O
was O
certain O
, O
however O
, O
that O
somebody O
was O
coming O
, O
Bingley O
instantly O
prevailed O
on O
Miss O
Bennet O
to O
avoid O
the O
confinement O
of O
such O
an O
intrusion O
, O
and O
walk O
away O
with O
him O
into O
the O
shrubbery O
. O
They O
both O
set O
off O
; O
and O
the O
conjectures O
of O
the O
remaining O
three O
continued O
, O
though O
with O
little O
satisfaction O
, O
till O
the O
door O
was O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
their O
visitor O
entered O
. O
It O
was O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
. O
They O
were O
of O
course O
all O
intending O
to O
be O
surprised O
: O
but O
their O
astonishment O
was O
beyond O
their O
expectation O
; O
and O
on O
the O
part O
of O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
and O
Kitty O
, O
though O
she O
was O
perfectly O
unknown O
to O
them O
, O
even O
inferior O
to O
what O
Elizabeth O
felt O
. O
She O
entered O
the O
room O
with O
an O
air O
more O
than O
usually O
ungracious O
, O
made O
no O
other O
reply O
to O
Elizabeth O
's O
salutation O
than O
a O
slight O
inclination O
of O
the O
head O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
mentioned O
her O
name O
to O
her O
mother O
on O
her O
Ladyship O
's O
entrance O
, O
though O
no O
request O
of O
introduction O
had O
been O
made O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
all O
amazement O
, O
though O
flattered O
by O
having O
a O
guest O
of O
such O
high O
importance O
, O
received O
her O
with O
the O
utmost O
politeness O
. O
After O
sitting O
for O
a O
moment O
in O
silence O
, O
she O
said O
, O
very O
stiffly O
, O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
hope O
you O
are O
well O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
. O
That O
lady O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
is O
your O
mother O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
replied O
very O
concisely O
that O
she O
was O
. O
" O
And O
_that_ O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
is O
one O
of O
your O
sisters O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
madam O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
delighted O
to O
speak O
to O
a O
Lady O
Catherine O
. O
" O
She O
is O
my O
youngest O
girl O
but O
one O
. O
My O
youngest O
of O
all O
is O
lately O
married O
, O
and O
my O
eldest O
is O
somewhere O
about O
the O
ground O
, O
walking O
with O
a O
young O
man O
, O
who O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
will O
soon O
become O
a O
part O
of O
the O
family O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
a O
very O
small O
park O
here O
, O
" O
returned O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
after O
a O
short O
silence O
. O
" O
It O
is O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
of O
Rosings O
, O
my O
Lady O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
; O
but O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
it O
is O
much O
larger O
than O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
's O
. O
" O
" O
This O
must O
be O
a O
most O
inconvenient O
sitting-room O
for O
the O
evening O
in O
summer O
: O
the O
windows O
are O
full O
west O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
assured O
her O
that O
they O
never O
sat O
there O
after O
dinner O
; O
and O
then O
added O
, O
-- O
" O
May O
I O
take O
the O
liberty O
of O
asking O
your O
Ladyship O
whether O
you O
left O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Collins O
well O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
very O
well O
. O
I O
saw O
them O
the O
night O
before O
last O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
now O
expected O
that O
she O
would O
produce O
a O
letter O
for O
her O
from O
Charlotte O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
the O
only O
probable O
motive O
for O
her O
calling O
. O
But O
no O
letter O
appeared O
, O
and O
she O
was O
completely O
puzzled O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
with O
great O
civility O
, O
begged O
her O
Ladyship O
to O
take O
some O
refreshment O
: O
but O
Lady O
Catherine O
very O
resolutely O
, O
and O
not O
very O
politely O
, O
declined O
eating O
anything O
; O
and O
then O
, O
rising O
up O
, O
said O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
-- O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
there O
seemed O
to O
be O
a O
prettyish O
kind O
of O
a O
little O
wilderness O
on O
one O
side O
of O
your O
lawn O
. O
I O
should O
be O
glad O
to O
take O
a O
turn O
in O
it O
, O
if O
you O
will O
favour O
me O
with O
your O
company O
. O
" O
" O
Go O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
and O
show O
her O
Ladyship O
about O
the O
different O
walks O
. O
I O
think O
she O
will O
be O
pleased O
with O
the O
hermitage O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
obeyed O
; O
and O
, O
running O
into O
her O
own O
room O
for O
her O
parasol O
, O
attended O
her O
noble O
guest O
downstairs O
. O
As O
they O
passed O
through O
the O
hall O
, O
Lady O
Catherine O
opened O
the O
doors O
into O
the O
dining-parlour O
and O
drawing-room O
, O
and O
pronouncing O
them O
, O
after O
a O
short O
survey O
, O
to O
be O
decent-looking O
rooms O
, O
walked O
on O
. O
Her O
carriage O
remained O
at O
the O
door O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
saw O
that O
her O
waiting-woman O
was O
in O
it O
. O
They O
proceeded O
in O
silence O
along O
the O
gravel O
walk O
that O
led O
to O
the O
copse O
; O
Elizabeth O
was O
determined O
to O
make O
no O
effort O
for O
conversation O
with O
a O
woman O
who O
was O
now O
more O
than O
usually O
insolent O
and O
disagreeable O
. O
" O
How O
could O
I O
ever O
think O
her O
like O
her O
nephew O
? O
" O
said O
she O
, O
as O
she O
looked O
in O
her O
face O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
they O
entered O
the O
copse O
, O
Lady O
Catherine O
began O
in O
the O
following O
manner O
: O
-- O
" O
You O
can O
be O
at O
no O
loss O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
to O
understand O
the O
reason O
of O
my O
journey O
hither O
. O
Your O
own O
heart O
, O
your O
own O
conscience O
, O
must O
tell O
you O
why O
I O
come O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
looked O
with O
unaffected O
astonishment O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
you O
are O
mistaken O
, O
madam O
; O
I O
have O
not O
been O
at O
all O
able O
to O
account O
for O
the O
honour O
of O
seeing O
you O
here O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
in O
an O
angry O
tone O
, O
" O
you O
ought O
to O
know O
that O
I O
am O
not O
to O
be O
trifled O
with O
. O
But O
however O
insincere O
_you_ O
may O
choose O
to O
be O
, O
you O
shall O
not O
find O
_me_ O
so O
. O
My O
character O
has O
ever O
been O
celebrated O
for O
its O
sincerity O
and O
frankness O
; O
and O
in O
a O
cause O
of O
such O
moment O
as O
this O
, O
I O
shall O
certainly O
not O
depart O
from O
it O
. O
A O
report O
of O
a O
most O
alarming O
nature O
reached O
me O
two O
days O
ago O
. O
I O
was O
told O
, O
that O
not O
only O
your O
sister O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
being O
most O
advantageously O
married O
, O
but O
that O
_you_ O
-- O
that O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
Bennet O
would O
, O
in O
all O
likelihood O
, O
be O
soon O
afterwards O
united O
to O
my O
nephew O
-- O
my O
own O
nephew O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
Though O
I O
_know_ O
it O
must O
be O
a O
scandalous O
falsehood O
, O
though O
I O
would O
not O
injure O
him O
so O
much O
as O
to O
suppose O
the O
truth O
of O
it O
possible O
, O
I O
instantly O
resolved O
on O
setting O
off O
for O
this O
place O
, O
that O
I O
might O
make O
my O
sentiments O
known O
to O
you O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
believed O
it O
impossible O
to O
be O
true O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
colouring O
with O
astonishment O
and O
disdain O
, O
" O
I O
wonder O
you O
took O
the O
trouble O
of O
coming O
so O
far O
. O
What O
could O
your O
Ladyship O
propose O
by O
it O
? O
" O
" O
At O
once O
to O
insist O
upon O
having O
such O
a O
report O
universally O
contradicted O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
coming O
to O
Longbourn O
, O
to O
see O
me O
and O
my O
family O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
coolly O
, O
" O
will O
be O
rather O
a O
confirmation O
of O
it O
-- O
if O
, O
indeed O
, O
such O
a O
report O
is O
in O
existence O
. O
" O
" O
If O
! O
do O
you O
then O
pretend O
to O
be O
ignorant O
of O
it O
? O
Has O
it O
not O
been O
industriously O
circulated O
by O
yourselves O
? O
Do O
you O
not O
know O
that O
such O
a O
report O
is O
spread O
abroad O
? O
" O
" O
I O
never O
heard O
that O
it O
was O
. O
" O
" O
And O
can O
you O
likewise O
declare O
, O
that O
there O
is O
no O
_foundation_ O
for O
it O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
possess O
equal O
frankness O
with O
your O
Ladyship O
. O
_You_ O
may O
ask O
questions O
which O
_I_ O
shall O
not O
choose O
to O
answer O
. O
" O
" O
This O
is O
not O
to O
be O
borne O
. O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
I O
insist O
on O
being O
satisfied O
. O
Has O
he O
, O
has O
my O
nephew O
, O
made O
you O
an O
offer O
of O
marriage O
? O
" O
" O
Your O
Ladyship O
has O
declared O
it O
to O
be O
impossible O
. O
" O
" O
It O
ought O
to O
be O
so O
; O
it O
must O
be O
so O
, O
while O
he O
retains O
the O
use O
of O
his O
reason O
. O
But O
_your_ O
arts O
and O
allurements O
may O
, O
in O
a O
moment O
of O
infatuation O
, O
have O
made O
him O
forget O
what O
he O
owes O
to O
himself O
and O
to O
all O
his O
family O
. O
You O
may O
have O
drawn O
him O
in O
. O
" O
" O
If O
I O
have O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
the O
last O
person O
to O
confess O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
do O
you O
know O
who O
I O
am O
? O
I O
have O
not O
been O
accustomed O
to O
such O
language O
as O
this O
. O
I O
am O
almost O
the O
nearest O
relation O
he O
has O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
am O
entitled O
to O
know O
all O
his O
dearest O
concerns O
. O
" O
" O
But O
you O
are O
not O
entitled O
to O
know O
_mine_ O
; O
nor O
will O
such O
behaviour O
as O
this O
ever O
induce O
me O
to O
be O
explicit O
. O
" O
" O
Let O
me O
be O
rightly O
understood O
. O
This O
match O
, O
to O
which O
you O
have O
the O
presumption O
to O
aspire O
, O
can O
never O
take O
place O
. O
No O
, O
never O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
engaged O
to O
_my O
daughter_ O
. O
Now O
, O
what O
have O
you O
to O
say O
? O
" O
" O
Only O
this O
, O
-- O
that O
if O
he O
is O
so O
, O
you O
can O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
suppose O
he O
will O
make O
an O
offer O
to O
me O
. O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
hesitated O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
replied O
, O
-- O
" O
The O
engagement O
between O
them O
is O
of O
a O
peculiar O
kind O
. O
From O
their O
infancy O
, O
they O
have O
been O
intended O
for O
each O
other O
. O
It O
was O
the O
favourite O
wish O
of O
_his_ O
mother O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
hers O
. O
While O
in O
their O
cradles O
we O
planned O
the O
union O
; O
and O
now O
, O
at O
the O
moment O
when O
the O
wishes O
of O
both O
sisters O
would O
be O
accomplished O
, O
is O
their O
marriage O
to O
be O
prevented O
by O
a O
young O
woman O
of O
inferior O
birth O
, O
of O
no O
importance O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
wholly O
unallied O
to O
the O
family O
? O
Do O
you O
pay O
no O
regard O
to O
the O
wishes O
of O
his O
friends O
-- O
to O
his O
tacit O
engagement O
with O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
? O
Are O
you O
lost O
to O
every O
feeling O
of O
propriety O
and O
delicacy O
? O
Have O
you O
not O
heard O
me O
say O
, O
that O
from O
his O
earliest O
hours O
he O
was O
destined O
for O
his O
cousin O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
and O
I O
had O
heard O
it O
before O
. O
But O
what O
is O
that O
to O
me O
? O
If O
there O
is O
no O
other O
objection O
to O
my O
marrying O
your O
nephew O
, O
I O
shall O
certainly O
not O
be O
kept O
from O
it O
by O
knowing O
that O
his O
mother O
and O
aunt O
wished O
him O
to O
marry O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
. O
You O
both O
did O
as O
much O
as O
you O
could O
in O
planning O
the O
marriage O
. O
Its O
completion O
depended O
on O
others O
. O
If O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
neither O
by O
honour O
nor O
inclination O
confined O
to O
his O
cousin O
, O
why O
is O
not O
he O
to O
make O
another O
choice O
? O
And O
if O
I O
am O
that O
choice O
, O
why O
may O
not O
I O
accept O
him O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
honour O
, O
decorum O
, O
prudence O
-- O
nay O
, O
interest O
-- O
forbid O
it O
. O
Yes O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
interest O
; O
for O
do O
not O
expect O
to O
be O
noticed O
by O
his O
family O
or O
friends O
, O
if O
you O
wilfully O
act O
against O
the O
inclinations O
of O
all O
. O
You O
will O
be O
censured O
, O
slighted O
, O
and O
despised O
, O
by O
everyone O
connected O
with O
him O
. O
Your O
alliance O
will O
be O
a O
disgrace O
; O
your O
name O
will O
never O
even O
be O
mentioned O
by O
any O
of O
us O
. O
" O
" O
These O
are O
heavy O
misfortunes O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
But O
the O
wife O
of O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
must O
have O
such O
extraordinary O
sources O
of O
happiness O
necessarily O
attached O
to O
her O
situation O
, O
that O
she O
could O
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
have O
no O
cause O
to O
repine O
. O
" O
" O
Obstinate O
, O
headstrong O
girl O
! O
I O
am O
ashamed O
of O
you O
! O
Is O
this O
your O
gratitude O
for O
my O
attentions O
to O
you O
last O
spring O
? O
Is O
nothing O
due O
to O
me O
on O
that O
score O
? O
Let O
us O
sit O
down O
. O
You O
are O
to O
understand O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
that O
I O
came O
here O
with O
the O
determined O
resolution O
of O
carrying O
my O
purpose O
; O
nor O
will O
I O
be O
dissuaded O
from O
it O

the O

If O

Miss O

I O
am O
shocked O

astonished O

I O
expected O
to O
find O
a O
more O
reasonable O
young O
woman O

do O
not O
deceive O
yourself O
into O
a O
belief O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
recede O

I O
shall O
not O
go O
away O
till O
you O
have O
given O
me O
the O
assurance O
I O
require O

" O
And O
I O
certainly O
_never_ O

give O
it O
. O
I O
am O
not O
to O
be O
intimidated O
into O
anything O
so O
wholly O

Your O
Ladyship O
wants O
Mr. O
Darcy O
to O
marry O
your O
daughter O

would O
my O
giving O
you O
the O
wished-for O
promise O
make O
_their_ O
marriage O
at O
all O
more O
probable O
? O
Supposing O
him O
to O

attached O

me O

would O
_my_ O
refusing O

accept O
his O
hand O
make O
him O
wish O

bestow O
it O
on O
his O
cousin O

Allow O
me O
to O
say O
, O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
that O
the O
arguments O
with O
which O
you O
have O
supported O
this O
extraordinary O
application O
have O
been O
as O
frivolous O
as O
the O
application O
was O
ill-judged O
. O
You O
have O
widely O
mistaken O
my O
character O
, O
if O
you O
think O
I O
can O
be O
worked O
on O
by O
such O
persuasions O
as O
these O
. O
How O
far O
your O
nephew O
might O
approve O
of O
your O
interference O
in O
_his_ O
affairs O
, O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
; O
but O
you O
have O
certainly O
no O
right O
to O
concern O
yourself O
in O
mine O
. O
I O
must O
beg O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
be O
importuned O
no O
further O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
so O
hasty O
, O
if O
you O
please O
. O
I O
have O
by O
no O
means O
done O
. O
To O
all O
the O
objections O
I O
have O
already O
urged O
I O
have O
still O
another O
to O
add O
. O
I O
am O
no O
stranger O
to O
the O
particulars O
of O
your O
youngest O
sister O

infamous O
elopement O
. O
I O
know O
it O
all O
; O
that O
the O
young O
man O

marrying O
her O
was O
a O
patched-up O
business O
, O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
your O
father O
and O
uncle O
. O
And O
is O
_such_ O
a O
girl O
to O
be O
my O
nephew O

sister O

Is O
_her_ O
husband O
, O
who O
is O
the O
son O
of O
his O
late O
father O

steward O
, O
to O

his O
brother O

Heaven O

of O
what O
are O
you O
thinking O

Are O
the O
shades O

Pemberley O

thus O
polluted O

" O
" O
You O
can O
_now_ O

nothing O

insulted O
me O

house O

she O
rose O

rose O
also O
, O

they O
turned O
back O

highly O
incensed O

for O
the O
honour O

of O
my O

Unfeeling O
, O
selfish O
girl O
! O
Do O
you O
not O
consider O
that O
a O
connection O
with O

must O
disgrace O
him O
in O
the O
eyes O
of O
everybody O

nothing O

him O

said O
no O
such O
thing O

am O
only O
resolved O
to O
act O
in O
that O
manner O

which O
will O
, O
in O
my O
own O
opinion O

constitute O
my O
happiness O

without O
reference O

to O
any O
person O
so O
wholly O
unconnected O
with O

It O
is O
well O

You O
refuse O
, O

, O
to O
oblige O
me O

You O
refuse O
to O
obey O
the O
claims O
of O
duty O
, O
honour O
, O

gratitude O

You O
are O
determined O
to O
ruin O
him O

the O
opinion O

all O
his O
friends O

make O
him O
the O
contempt O
of O
the O
world O

" O
" O
Neither O
duty O

nor O
honour O
, O
nor O
gratitude O

" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
has O
any O
possible O
claim O
on O
me O
, O
in O
the O
present O
instance O
. O
No O
principle O
of O
either O
would O
be O
violated O
by O
my O
marriage O

with O
regard O

the O
resentment O

the O
indignation O
of O
the O
world O
, O
if O
the O
former O
_were_ O
excited O
by O
his O

it O
would O
not O
give O
me O
one O
moment O

concern O
-- O
and O
the O
world O
in O
general O
would O
have O
too O
much O
sense O
to O
join O
in O
the O
scorn O
. O
" O
" O
And O
this O
is O
your O
real O
opinion O
! O
This O
is O
your O
final O
resolve O
! O
Very O
well O
. O
I O
shall O
now O
know O
how O
to O
act O
. O
Do O
not O
imagine O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
that O
your O
ambition O
will O
ever O
be O
gratified O
. O
I O
came O
to O
try O
you O
. O
I O
hoped O
to O
find O
you O
reasonable O
; O
but O
depend O
upon O
it O
I O
will O
carry O
my O
point O
. O
" O
In O
this O
manner O
Lady O
Catherine O
talked O
on O
till O
they O
were O
at O
the O
door O
of O
the O
carriage O
, O
when O
, O
turning O
hastily O
round O
, O
she O
added O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
take O
no O
leave O
of O
you O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
. O
I O
send O
no O
compliments O
to O
your O
mother O
. O
You O
deserve O
no O
such O
attention O
. O
I O
am O
most O
seriously O
displeased O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
made O
no O
answer O
; O
and O
without O
attempting O
to O
persuade O
her O
Ladyship O
to O
return O
into O
the O
house O
, O
walked O
quietly O
into O
it O
herself O
. O
She O
heard O
the O
carriage O
drive O
away O
as O
she O
proceeded O
upstairs O
. O
Her O
mother O
impatiently O
met O
her O
at O
the O
door O
of O
her O
dressing-room O
, O
to O
ask O
why O
Lady O
Catherine O
would O
not O
come O
in O
again O
and O
rest O
herself O
. O
" O
She O
did O
not O
choose O
it O
, O
" O
said O
her O
daughter O
; O
" O
she O
would O
go O
. O
" O
" O
She O
is O
a O
very O
fine-looking O
woman O
! O
and O
her O
calling O
here O
was O
prodigiously O
civil O
! O
for O
she O
only O
came O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
tell O
us O
the O
Collinses O
were O
well O
. O
She O
is O
on O
her O
road O
somewhere O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
; O
and O
so O
, O
passing O
through O
Meryton O
, O
thought O
she O
might O
as O
well O
call O
on O
you O
. O
I O
suppose O
she O
had O
nothing O
particular O
to O
say O
to O
you O
, O
Lizzy O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
forced O
to O
give O
in O
to O
a O
little O
falsehood O
here O
; O
for O
to O
acknowledge O
the O
substance O
of O
their O
conversation O
was O
impossible O
