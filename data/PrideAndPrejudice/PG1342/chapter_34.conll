When O
they O
were O
gone O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
as O
if O
intending O
to O
exasperate O
herself O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
against O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
chose O
for O
her O
employment O
the O
examination O
of O
all O
the O
letters O
which O
Jane O
had O
written O
to O
her O
since O
her O
being O
in O
Kent O
. O
They O
contained O
no O
actual O
complaint O
, O
nor O
was O
there O
any O
revival O
of O
past O
occurrences O
, O
or O
any O
communication O
of O
present O
suffering O
. O
But O
in O
all O
, O
and O
in O
almost O
every O
line O
of O
each O
, O
there O
was O
a O
want O
of O
that O
cheerfulness O
which O
had O
been O
used O
to O
characterize O
her O
style O
, O
and O
which O
, O
proceeding O
from O
the O
serenity O
of O
a O
mind O
at O
ease O
with O
itself O
, O
and O
kindly O
disposed O
towards O
everyone O
, O
had O
been O
scarcely O
ever O
clouded O
. O
Elizabeth O
noticed O
every O
sentence O
conveying O
the O
idea O
of O
uneasiness O
, O
with O
an O
attention O
which O
it O
had O
hardly O
received O
on O
the O
first O
perusal O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
shameful O
boast O
of O
what O
misery O
he O
had O
been O
able O
to O
inflict O
gave O
her O
a O
keener O
sense O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
sufferings O
. O
It O
was O
some O
consolation O
to O
think O
that O
his O
visit O
to O
Rosings O
was O
to O
end O
on O
the O
day O
after O
the O
next O
, O
and O
a O
still O
greater O
that O
in O
less O
than O
a O
fortnight O
she O
should O
herself O
be O
with O
Jane O
again O
, O
and O
enabled O
to O
contribute O
to O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
spirits O
, O
by O
all O
that O
affection O
could O
do O
. O
She O
could O
not O
think O
of O
Darcy O
's O
leaving O
Kent O
without O
remembering O
that O
his O
cousin O
was O
to O
go O
with O
him O
; O
but O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
had O
made O
it O
clear O
that O
he O
had O
no O
intentions O
at O
all O
, O
and O
, O
agreeable O
as O
he O
was O
, O
she O
did O
not O
mean O
to O
be O
unhappy O
about O
him O
. O
While O
settling O
this O
point O
, O
she O
was O
suddenly O
roused O
by O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
door-bell O
; O
and O
her O
spirits O
were O
a O
little O
fluttered O
by O
the O
idea O
of O
its O
being O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
himself O
, O
who O
had O
once O
before O
called O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
might O
now O
come O
to O
inquire O
particularly O
after O
her O
. O
But O
this O
idea O
was O
soon O
banished O
, O
and O
her O
spirits O
were O
very O
differently O
affected O
, O
when O
, O
to O
her O
utter O
amazement O
, O
she O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy O
walk O
into O
the O
room O
. O
In O
a O
hurried O
manner O
he O
immediately O
began O
an O
inquiry O
after O
her O
health O
, O
imputing O
his O
visit O
to O
a O
wish O
of O
hearing O
that O
she O
were O
better O
. O
She O
answered O
him O
with O
cold O
civility O
. O
He O
sat O
down O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
and O
then O
getting O
up O
walked O
about O
the O
room O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
surprised O
, O
but O
said O
not O
a O
word O
. O
After O
a O
silence O
of O
several O
minutes O
, O
he O
came O
towards O
her O
in O
an O
agitated O
manner O
, O
and O
thus O
began O
: O
-- O
" O
In O
vain O
have O
I O
struggled O
. O
It O
will O
not O
do O
. O
My O
feelings O
will O
not O
be O
repressed O
. O
You O
must O
allow O
me O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
ardently O
I O
admire O
and O
love O
you O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
's O
astonishment O
was O
beyond O
expression O
. O
She O
stared O
, O
coloured O
, O
doubted O
, O
and O
was O
silent O
. O
This O
he O
considered O
sufficient O
encouragement O
, O
and O
the O
avowal O
of O
all O
that O
he O
felt O
and O
had O
long O
felt O
for O
her O
immediately O
followed O
. O
He O
spoke O
well O
; O
but O
there O
were O
feelings O
besides O
those O
of O
the O
heart O
to O
be O
detailed O
, O
and O
he O
was O
not O
more O
eloquent O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
tenderness O
than O
of O
pride O
. O
His O
sense O
of O
her O
inferiority O
, O
of O
its O
being O
a O
degradation O
, O
of O
the O
family O
obstacles O
which O
judgment O
had O
always O
opposed O
to O
inclination O
, O
were O
dwelt O
on O
with O
a O
warmth O
which O
seemed O
due O
to O
the O
consequence O
he O
was O
wounding O
, O
but O
was O
very O
unlikely O
to O
recommend O
his O
suit O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
her O
deeply-rooted O
dislike O
, O
she O
could O
not O
be O
insensible O
to O
the O
compliment O
of O
such O
a O
man O
's O
affection O
, O
and O
though O
her O
intentions O
did O
not O
vary O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
she O
was O
at O
first O
sorry O
for O
the O
pain O
he O
was O
to O
receive O
; O
till O
roused O
to O
resentment O
by O
his O
subsequent O
language O
, O
she O
lost O
all O
compassion O
in O
anger O
. O
She O
tried O
, O
however O
, O
to O
compose O
herself O
to O
answer O
him O
with O
patience O
, O
when O
he O
should O
have O
done O
. O
He O
concluded O
with O
representing O
to O
her O
the O
strength O
of O
that O
attachment O
which O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
his O
endeavours O
he O
had O
found O
impossible O
to O
conquer O
; O
and O
with O
expressing O
his O
hope O
that O
it O
would O
now O
be O
rewarded O
by O
her O
acceptance O
of O
his O
hand O
. O
As O
he O
said O
this O
she O
could O
easily O
see O
that O
he O
had O
no O
doubt O
of O
a O
favourable O
answer O
. O
He O
_spoke_ O
of O
apprehension O
and O
anxiety O
, O
but O
his O
countenance O
expressed O
real O
security O
. O
Such O
a O
circumstance O
could O
only O
exasperate O
farther O
; O
and O
when O
he O
ceased O
the O
colour O
rose O
into O
her O
cheeks O
and O
she O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
In O
such O
cases O
as O
this O
, O
it O
is O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
the O
established O
mode O
to O
express O
a O
sense O
of O
obligation O
for O
the O
sentiments O
avowed O
, O
however O
unequally O
they O
may O
be O
returned O
. O
It O
is O
natural O
that O
obligation O
should O
be O
felt O
, O
and O
if O
I O
could O
_feel_ O
gratitude O
, O
I O
would O
now O
thank O
you O
. O
But O
I O
can O
not O
-- O
I O
have O
never O
desired O
your O
good O
opinion O
, O
and O
you O
have O
certainly O
bestowed O
it O
most O
unwillingly O
. O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
have O
occasioned O
pain O
to O
anyone O
. O
It O
has O
been O
most O
unconsciously O
done O
, O
however O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
will O
be O
of O
short O
duration O
. O
The O
feelings O
which O
you O
tell O
me O
have O
long O
prevented O
the O
acknowledgment O
of O
your O
regard O
can O
have O
little O
difficulty O
in O
overcoming O
it O
after O
this O
explanation O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
who O
was O
leaning O
against O
the O
mantel-piece O
with O
his O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
her O
face O
, O
seemed O
to O
catch O
her O
words O
with O
no O
less O
resentment O
than O
surprise O
. O
His O
complexion O
became O
pale O
with O
anger O
, O
and O
the O
disturbance O
of O
his O
mind O
was O
visible O
in O
every O
feature O
. O
He O
was O
struggling O
for O
the O
appearance O
of O
composure O
, O
and O
would O
not O
open O
his O
lips O
till O
he O
believed O
himself O
to O
have O
attained O
it O
. O
The O
pause O
was O
to O
Elizabeth O
's O
feelings O
dreadful O
. O
At O
length O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
forced O
calmness O
, O
he O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
And O
this O
is O
all O
the O
reply O
which O
I O
am O
to O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
expecting O
! O
I O
might O
, O
perhaps O
, O
wish O
to O
be O
informed O
why O
, O
with O
so O
little O
_endeavour_ O
at O
civility O
, O
I O
am O
thus O
rejected O
. O
But O
it O
is O
of O
small O
importance O
. O
" O
" O
I O
might O
as O
well O
inquire O
, O
" O
replied O
she O
, O
" O
why O
, O
with O
so O
evident O
a O
design O
of O
offending O
and O
insulting O
me O
, O
you O
chose O
to O
tell O
me O
that O
you O
liked O
me O
against O
your O
will O
, O
against O
your O
reason O
, O
and O
even O
against O
your O
character O
? O
Was O
not O
this O
some O
excuse O
for O
incivility O
, O
if O
I O
_was_ O
uncivil O
? O
But O
I O
have O
other O
provocations O
. O
You O
know O
I O
have O
. O
Had O
not O
my O
own O
feelings O
decided O
against O
you O
, O
had O
they O
been O
indifferent O
, O
or O
had O
they O
even O
been O
favourable O
, O
do O
you O
think O
that O
any O
consideration O
would O
tempt O
me O
to O
accept O
the O
man O
who O
has O
been O
the O
means O
of O
ruining O
, O
perhaps O
for O
ever O
, O
the O
happiness O
of O
a O
most O
beloved O
sister O
? O
" O
As O
she O
pronounced O
these O
words O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
changed O
colour O
; O
but O
the O
emotion O
was O
short O
, O
and O
he O
listened O
without O
attempting O
to O
interrupt O
her O
while O
she O
continued O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
have O
every O
reason O
in O
the O
world O
to O
think O
ill O
of O
you O
. O
No O
motive O
can O
excuse O
the O
unjust O
and O
ungenerous O
part O
you O
acted O
_there_ O
. O
You O
dare O
not O
, O
you O
can O
not O
deny O
that O
you O
have O
been O
the O
principal O
, O
if O
not O
the O
only O
means O
of O
dividing O
them O
from O
each O
other O
, O
of O
exposing O
one O
to O
the O
censure O
of O
the O
world O
for O
caprice O
and O
instability O
, O
the O
other O
to O
its O
derision O
for O
disappointed O
hopes O
, O
and O
involving O
them O
both O
in O
misery O
of O
the O
acutest O
kind O
. O
" O
She O
paused O
, O
and O
saw O
with O
no O
slight O
indignation O
that O
he O
was O
listening O
with O
an O
air O
which O
proved O
him O
wholly O
unmoved O
by O
any O
feeling O
of O
remorse O
. O
He O
even O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
a O
smile O
of O
affected O
incredulity O
. O
" O
Can O
you O
deny O
that O
you O
have O
done O
it O
? O
" O
she O
repeated O
. O
With O
assumed O
tranquillity O
he O
then O
replied O
, O
" O
I O
have O
no O
wish O
of O
denying O
that O
I O
did O
everything O
in O
my O
power O
to O
separate O
my O
friend O
from O
your O
sister O
, O
or O
that O
I O
rejoice O
in O
my O
success O
. O
Towards O
_him_ O
I O
have O
been O
kinder O
than O
towards O
myself O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
disdained O
the O
appearance O
of O
noticing O
this O
civil O
reflection O
, O
but O
its O
meaning O
did O
not O
escape O
, O
nor O
was O
it O
likely O
to O
conciliate O
her O
. O
" O
But O
it O
is O
not O
merely O
this O
affair O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
" O
on O
which O
my O
dislike O
is O
founded O
. O
Long O
before O
it O
had O
taken O
place O
, O
my O
opinion O
of O
you O
was O
decided O
. O
Your O
character O
was O
unfolded O
in O
the O
recital O
which O
I O
received O
many O
months O
ago O
from O
Mr. O
Wickham O
. O
On O
this O
subject O
, O
what O
can O
you O
have O
to O
say O
? O
In O
what O
imaginary O
act O
of O
friendship O
can O
you O
here O
defend O
yourself O
? O
or O
under O
what O
misrepresentation O
can O
you O
here O
impose O
upon O
others O
? O
" O
" O
You O
take O
an O
eager O
interest O
in O
that O
gentleman O
's O
concerns O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
, O
in O
a O
less O
tranquil O
tone O
, O
and O
with O
a O
heightened O
colour O
. O
" O
Who O
that O
knows O
what O
his O
misfortunes O
have O
been O
can O
help O
feeling O
an O
interest O
in O
him O
? O
" O
" O
His O
misfortunes O
! O
" O
repeated O
Darcy O
, O
contemptuously O
, O
-- O
" O
yes O
, O
his O
misfortunes O
have O
been O
great O
indeed O
. O
" O
" O
And O
of O
your O
infliction O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
with O
energy O
; O
" O
You O
have O
reduced O
him O
to O
his O
present O
state O
of O
poverty O
-- O
comparative O
poverty O
. O
You O
have O
withheld O
the O
advantages O
which O
you O
must O
know O
to O
have O
been O
designed O
for O
him O
. O
You O
have O
deprived O
the O
best O
years O
of O
his O
life O
of O
that O
independence O
which O
was O
no O
less O
his O
due O
than O
his O
desert O
. O
You O
have O
done O
all O
this O
! O
and O
yet O
you O
can O
treat O
the O
mention O
of O
his O
misfortunes O
with O
contempt O
and O
ridicule O
. O
" O
" O
And O
this O
, O
" O
cried O
Darcy O
, O
as O
he O
walked O
with O
quick O
steps O
across O
the O
room O
, O
" O
is O
your O
opinion O
of O
me O
! O
This O
is O
the O
estimation O
in O
which O
you O
hold O
me O
! O
I O
thank O
you O
for O
explaining O
it O
so O
fully O
. O
My O
faults O
, O
according O
to O
this O
calculation O
, O
are O
heavy O
indeed O
! O
But O
, O
perhaps O
, O
" O
added O
he O
, O
stopping O
in O
his O
walk O
, O
and O
turning O
towards O
her O
, O
" O
these O
offences O
might O
have O
been O
overlooked O
, O
had O
not O
your O
pride O
been O
hurt O
by O
my O
honest O
confession O
of O
the O
scruples O
that O
had O
long O
prevented O
my O
forming O
any O
serious O
design O
. O
These O
bitter O
accusations O
might O
have O
been O
suppressed O
, O
had O
I O
, O
with O
greater O
policy O
, O
concealed O
my O
struggles O
, O
and O
flattered O
you O
into O
the O
belief O
of O
my O
being O
impelled O
by O
unqualified O
, O
unalloyed O
inclination O
; O
by O
reason O
, O
by O
reflection O
, O
by O
everything O
. O
But O
disguise O
of O
every O
sort O
is O
my O
abhorrence O
. O
Nor O
am O
I O
ashamed O
of O
the O
feelings O
I O
related O
. O
They O
were O
natural O
and O
just O
. O
Could O
you O
expect O
me O
to O
rejoice O
in O
the O
inferiority O
of O
your O
connections O
? O
-- O
to O
congratulate O
myself O
on O
the O
hope O
of O
relations O
whose O
condition O
in O
life O
is O
so O
decidedly O
beneath O
my O
own O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
felt O
herself O
growing O
more O
angry O
every O
moment O
; O
yet O
she O
tried O
to O
the O
utmost O
to O
speak O
with O
composure O
when O
she O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
You O
are O
mistaken O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
if O
you O
suppose O
that O
the O
mode O
of O
your O
declaration O
affected O
me O
in O
any O
other O
way O
than O
as O
it O
spared O
me O
the O
concern O
which O
I O
might O
have O
felt O
in O
refusing O
you O
, O
had O
you O
behaved O
in O
a O
more O
gentlemanlike O
manner O
. O
" O
She O
saw O
him O
start O
at O
this O
; O
but O
he O
said O
nothing O
, O
and O
she O
continued O
, O
-- O
" O
You O
could O
not O
have O
made O
me O
the O
offer O
of O
your O
hand O
in O
any O
possible O
way O
that O
would O
have O
tempted O
me O
to O
accept O
it O
. O
" O
Again O
his O
astonishment O
was O
obvious O
; O
and O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
mingled O
incredulity O
and O
mortification O
. O
She O
went O
on O
, O
-- O
" O
From O
the O
very O
beginning O
, O
from O
the O
first O
moment O
, O
I O
may O
almost O
say O
, O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
with O
you O
, O
your O
manners O
impressing O
me O
with O
the O
fullest O
belief O
of O
your O
arrogance O
, O
your O
conceit O
, O
and O
your O
selfish O
disdain O
of O
the O
feelings O
of O
others O
, O
were O
such O
as O
to O
form O
that O
groundwork O
of O
disapprobation O
, O
on O
which O
succeeding O
events O
have O
built O
so O
immovable O
a O
dislike O
; O
and O
I O
had O
not O
known O
you O
a O
month O
before O
I O
felt O
that O
you O
were O
the O
last O
man O
in O
the O
world O
whom O
I O
could O
ever O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
marry O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
said O
quite O
enough O
, O
madam O
. O
I O
perfectly O
comprehend O
your O
feelings O
, O
and O
have O
now O
only O
to O
be O
ashamed O
of O
what O
my O
own O
have O
been O
. O
Forgive O
me O
for O
having O
taken O
up O
so O
much O
of O
your O
time O
, O
and O
accept O
my O
best O
wishes O
for O
your O
health O
and O
happiness O
. O
" O
And O
with O
these O
words O
he O
hastily O
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
heard O
him O
the O
next O
moment O
open O
the O
front O
door O
and O
quit O
the O
house O
. O
The O
tumult O
of O
her O
mind O
was O
now O
painfully O
great O
. O
She O
knew O
not O
how O
to O
support O
herself O
, O
and O
, O
from O
actual O
weakness O
, O
sat O
down O
and O
cried O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
. O
Her O
astonishment O
, O
as O
she O
reflected O
on O
what O
had O
passed O
, O
was O
increased O
by O
every O
review O
of O
it O
. O
That O
she O
should O
receive O
an O
offer O
of O
marriage O
from O
Mr. O
Darcy O
! O
that O
he O
should O
have O
been O
in O
love O
with O
her O
for O
so O
many O
months O
! O
so O
much O
in O
love O
as O
to O
wish O
to O
marry O
her O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
the O
objections O
which O
had O
made O
him O
prevent O
his O
friend O
's O
marrying O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
which O
must O
appear O
at O
least O
with O
equal O
force O
in O
his O
own O
case O
, O
was O
almost O
incredible O
! O
it O
was O
gratifying O
to O
have O
inspired O
unconsciously O
so O
strong O
an O
affection O
. O
But O
his O
pride O
, O
his O
abominable O
pride O
, O
his O
shameless O
avowal O
of O
what O
he O
had O
done O
with O
respect O
to O
Jane O
, O
his O
unpardonable O
assurance O
in O
acknowledging O
, O
though O
he O
could O
not O
justify O
it O
, O
and O
the O
unfeeling O
manner O
which O
he O
had O
mentioned O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
his O
cruelty O
towards O
whom O
he O
had O
not O
attempted O
to O
deny O
, O
soon O
overcame O
the O
pity O
which O
the O
consideration O
of O
his O
attachment O
had O
for O
a O
moment O
excited O
. O
She O
continued O
in O
very O
agitating O
reflections O
till O
the O
sound O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
carriage O
made O
her O
feel O
how O
unequal O
she O
was O
to O
encounter O
Charlotte O
's O
observation O
, O
and O
hurried O
her O
away O
to O
her O
room O
. O
