The O
whole O
party O
were O
in O
hopes O
of O
a O
letter O
from O
Mr. O
Bennet O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
but O
the O
post O
came O
in O
without O
bringing O
a O
single O
line O
from O
him O
. O
His O
family O
knew O
him O
to O
be O
, O
on O
all O
common O
occasions O
, O
a O
most O
negligent O
and O
dilatory O
correspondent O
; O
but O
at O
such O
a O
time O
they O
had O
hoped O
for O
exertion O
. O
They O
were O
forced O
to O
conclude O
, O
that O
he O
had O
no O
pleasing O
intelligence O
to O
send O
; O
but O
even O
of O
_that_ O
they O
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
be O
certain O
. O
Mr O
. O
Gardiner O
had O
waited O
only O
for O
the O
letters O
before O
he O
set O
off O
. O
When O
he O
was O
gone O
, O
they O
were O
certain O
at O
least O
of O
receiving O
constant O
information O
of O
what O
was O
going O
on O
; O
and O
their O
uncle O
promised O
, O
at O
parting O
, O
to O
prevail O
on O
Mr. O
Bennet O
to O
return O
to O
Longbourn O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
could O
, O
to O
the O
great O
consolation O
of O
his O
sister O
, O
who O
considered O
it O
as O
the O
only O
security O
for O
her O
husband O
's O
not O
being O
killed O
in O
a O
duel O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
and O
the O
children O
were O
to O
remain O
in O
Hertfordshire O
a O
few O
days O
longer O
, O
as O
the O
former O
thought O
her O
presence O
might O
be O
serviceable O
to O
her O
nieces O
. O
She O
shared O
in O
their O
attendance O
on O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
and O
was O
a O
great O
comfort O
to O
them O
in O
their O
hours O
of O
freedom O
. O
Their O
other O
aunt O
also O
visited O
them O
frequently O
, O
and O
always O
, O
as O
she O
said O
, O
with O
the O
design O
of O
cheering O
and O
heartening O
them O
up O
-- O
though O
, O
as O
she O
never O
came O
without O
reporting O
some O
fresh O
instance O
of O
Wickham O
's O
extravagance O
or O
irregularity O
, O
she O
seldom O
went O
away O
without O
leaving O
them O
more O
dispirited O
than O
she O
found O
them O
. O
All O
Meryton O
seemed O
striving O
to O
blacken O
the O
man O
who O
, O
but O
three O
months O
before O
, O
had O
been O
almost O
an O
angel O
of O
light O
. O
He O
was O
declared O
to O
be O
in O
debt O
to O
every O
tradesman O
in O
the O
place O
, O
and O
his O
intrigues O
, O
all O
honoured O
with O
the O
title O
of O
seduction O
, O
had O
been O
extended O
into O
every O
tradesman O
's O
family O
. O
Everybody O
declared O
that O
he O
was O
the O
wickedest O
young O
man O
in O
the O
world O
; O
and O
everybody O
began O
to O
find O
out O
that O
they O
had O
always O
distrusted O
the O
appearance O
of O
his O
goodness O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
though O
she O
did O
not O
credit O
above O
half O
of O
what O
was O
said O
, O
believed O
enough O
to O
make O
her O
former O
assurance O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
ruin O
still O
more O
certain O
; O
and O
even O
Jane O
, O
who O
believed O
still O
less O
of O
it O
, O
became O
almost O
hopeless O
, O
more O
especially O
as O
the O
time O
was O
now O
come O
, O
when O
, O
if O
they O
had O
gone O
to O
Scotland O
, O
which O
she O
had O
never O
before O
entirely O
despaired O
of O
, O
they O
must O
in O
all O
probability O
have O
gained O
some O
news O
of O
them O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
left O
Longbourn O
on O
Sunday O
; O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
his O
wife O
received O
a O
letter O
from O
him O
: O
it O
told O
them O
, O
that O
on O
his O
arrival O
he O
had O
immediately O
found O
out O
his O
brother O
, O
and O
persuaded O
him O
to O
come O
to O
Gracechurch O
Street O
. O
That O
Mr. O
Bennet O
had O
been O
to O
Epsom O
and O
Clapham O
, O
before O
his O
arrival O
, O
but O
without O
gaining O
any O
satisfactory O
information O
; O
and O
that O
he O
was O
now O
determined O
to O
inquire O
at O
all O
the O
principal O
hotels O
in O
town O
, O
as O
Mr. O
Bennet O
thought O
it O
possible O
they O
might O
have O
gone O
to O
one O
of O
them O
, O
on O
their O
first O
coming O
to O
London O
, O
before O
they O
procured O
lodgings O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
himself O
did O
not O
expect O
any O
success O
from O
this O
measure O
; O
but O
as O
his O
brother O
was O
eager O
in O
it O
, O
he O
meant O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
pursuing O
it O
. O
He O
added O
, O
that O
Mr O
. O
Bennet O
seemed O
wholly O
disinclined O
at O
present O
to O
leave O
London O
, O
and O
promised O
to O
write O
again O
very O
soon O
. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
postscript O
to O
this O
effect O
: O
-- O
" O
I O
have O
written O
to O
Colonel O
Forster O
to O
desire O
him O
to O
find O
out O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
from O
some O
of O
the O
young O
man O
's O
intimates O
in O
the O
regiment O
, O
whether O
Wickham O
has O
any O
relations O
or O
connections O
who O
would O
be O
likely O
to O
know O
in O
what O
part O
of O
the O
town O
he O
has O
now O
concealed O
himself O
. O
If O
there O
were O
anyone O
that O
one O
could O
apply O
to O
, O
with O
a O
probability O
of O
gaining O
such O
a O
clue O
as O
that O
, O
it O
might O
be O
of O
essential O
consequence O
. O
At O
present O
we O
have O
nothing O
to O
guide O
us O
. O
Colonel O
Forster O
will O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
do O
everything O
in O
his O
power O
to O
satisfy O
us O
on O
this O
head O
. O
But O
, O
on O
second O
thoughts O
, O
perhaps O
Lizzy O
could O
tell O
us O
what O
relations O
he O
has O
now O
living O
better O
than O
any O
other O
person O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
at O
no O
loss O
to O
understand O
from O
whence O
this O
deference O
for O
her O
authority O
proceeded O
; O
but O
it O
was O
not O
in O
her O
power O
to O
give O
any O
information O
of O
so O
satisfactory O
a O
nature O
as O
the O
compliment O
deserved O
. O
She O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
his O
having O
had O
any O
relations O
, O
except O
a O
father O
and O
mother O
, O
both O
of O
whom O
had O
been O
dead O
many O
years O
. O
It O
was O
possible O
, O
however O
, O
that O
some O
of O
his O
companions O
in O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
might O
be O
able O
to O
give O
more O
information O
; O
and O
though O
she O
was O
not O
very O
sanguine O
in O
expecting O
it O
, O
the O
application O
was O
a O
something O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
. O
Every O
day O
at O
Longbourn O
was O
now O
a O
day O
of O
anxiety O
; O
but O
the O
most O
anxious O
part O
of O
each O
was O
when O
the O
post O
was O
expected O
. O
The O
arrival O
of O
letters O
was O
the O
first O
grand O
object O
of O
every O
morning O
's O
impatience O
. O
Through O
letters O
, O
whatever O
of O
good O
or O
bad O
was O
to O
be O
told O
would O
be O
communicated O
; O
and O
every O
succeeding O
day O
was O
expected O
to O
bring O
some O
news O
of O
importance O
. O
But O
before O
they O
heard O
again O
from O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
a O
letter O
arrived O
for O
their O
father O
, O
from O
a O
different O
quarter O
, O
from O
Mr. O
Collins O
; O
which O
, O
as O
Jane O
had O
received O
directions O
to O
open O
all O
that O
came O
for O
him O
in O
his O
absence O
, O
she O
accordingly O
read O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
knew O
what O
curiosities O
his O
letters O
always O
were O
, O
looked O
over O
her O
, O
and O
read O
it O
likewise O
. O
It O
was O
as O
follows O
: O
-- O
/ O
* O
" O
My O
dear O
Sir O
, O
* O
/ O
" O
I O
feel O
myself O
called O
upon O
, O
by O
our O
relationship O
, O
and O
my O
situation O
in O
life O
, O
to O
condole O
with O
you O
on O
the O
grievous O
affliction O
you O
are O
now O
suffering O
under O
, O
of O
which O
we O
were O
yesterday O
informed O
by O
a O
letter O
from O
Hertfordshire O
. O
Be O
assured O
, O
my O
dear O
sir O
, O
that O
Mrs. O
Collins O
and O
myself O
sincerely O
sympathize O
with O
you O
, O
and O
all O
your O
respectable O
family O
, O
in O
your O
present O
distress O
, O
which O
must O
be O
of O
the O
bitterest O
kind O
, O
because O
proceeding O
from O
a O
cause O
which O
no O
time O
can O
remove O
. O
No O
arguments O
shall O
be O
wanting O
on O
my O
part O
, O
that O
can O
alleviate O
so O
severe O
a O
misfortune O
; O
or O
that O
may O
comfort O
you O
, O
under O
a O
circumstance O
that O
must O
be O
, O
of O
all O
others O
, O
most O
afflicting O
to O
a O
parent O
's O
mind O
. O
The O
death O
of O
your O
daughter O
would O
have O
been O
a O
blessing O
in O
comparison O
of O
this O
. O
And O
it O
is O
the O
more O
to O
be O
lamented O
, O
because O
there O
is O
reason O
to O
suppose O
, O
as O
my O
dear O
Charlotte O
informs O
me O
, O
that O
this O
licentiousness O
of O
behaviour O
in O
your O
daughter O
has O
proceeded O
from O
a O
faulty O
degree O
of O
indulgence O
; O
though O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
for O
the O
consolation O
of O
yourself O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
think O
that O
her O
own O
disposition O
must O
be O
naturally O
bad O
, O
or O
she O
could O
not O
be O
guilty O
of O
such O
an O
enormity O
, O
at O
so O
early O
an O
age O
. O
Howsoever O
that O
may O
be O
, O
you O
are O
grievously O
to O
be O
pitied O
; O
in O
which O
opinion O
I O
am O
not O
only O
joined O
by O
Mrs. O
Collins O
, O
but O
likewise O
by O
Lady O
Catherine O
and O
her O
daughter O
, O
to O
whom O
I O
have O
related O
the O
affair O
. O
They O
agree O
with O
me O
in O
apprehending O
that O
this O
false O
step O
in O
one O
daughter O
will O
be O
injurious O
to O
the O
fortunes O
of O
all O
the O
others O
: O
for O
who O
, O
as O
Lady O
Catherine O
herself O
condescendingly O
says O
, O
will O
connect O
themselves O
with O
such O
a O
family O
? O
And O
this O
consideration O
leads O
me O
, O
moreover O
, O
to O
reflect O
, O
with O
augmented O
satisfaction O
, O
on O
a O
certain O
event O
of O
last O
November O
; O
for O
had O
it O
been O
otherwise O
, O
I O
must O
have O
been O
involved O
in O
all O
your O
sorrow O
and O
disgrace O
. O
Let O
me O
advise O
you O
, O
then O
, O
my O
dear O
sir O
, O
to O
console O
yourself O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
to O
throw O
off O
your O
unworthy O
child O
from O
your O
affection O
for O
ever O
, O
and O
leave O
her O
to O
reap O
the O
fruits O
of O
her O
own O
heinous O
offence O
. O
" O
I O
am O
, O
dear O
sir O
, O
" O
etc. O
, O
etc O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
did O
not O
write O
again O
, O
till O
he O
had O
received O
an O
answer O
from O
Colonel O
Forster O
; O
and O
then O
he O
had O
nothing O
of O
a O
pleasant O
nature O
to O
send O
. O
It O
was O
not O
known O
that O
Wickham O
had O
a O
single O
relation O
with O
whom O
he O
kept O
up O
any O
connection O
, O
and O
it O
was O
certain O
that O
he O
had O
no O
near O
one O
living O
. O
His O
former O
acquaintance O
had O
been O
numerous O
; O
but O
since O
he O
had O
been O
in O
the O
militia O
, O
it O
did O
not O
appear O
that O
he O
was O
on O
terms O
of O
particular O
friendship O
with O
any O
of O
them O
. O
There O
was O
no O
one O
, O
therefore O
, O
who O
could O
be O
pointed O
out O
as O
likely O
to O
give O
any O
news O
of O
him O
. O
And O
in O
the O
wretched O
state O
of O
his O
own O
finances O
, O
there O
was O
a O
very O
powerful O
motive O
for O
secrecy O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
fear O
of O
discovery O
by O
Lydia O
's O
relations O
; O
for O
it O
had O
just O
transpired O
that O
he O
had O
left O
gaming O
debts O
behind O
him O
to O
a O
very O
considerable O
amount O
. O
Colonel O
Forster O
believed O
that O
more O
than O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
would O
be O
necessary O
to O
clear O
his O
expenses O
at O
Brighton O
. O
He O
owed O
a O
good O
deal O
in O
the O
town O
, O
but O
his O
debts O
of O
honour O
were O
still O
more O
formidable O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
conceal O
these O
particulars O
from O
the O
Longbourn O
family O
; O
Jane O
heard O
them O
with O
horror O
. O
" O
A O
gamester O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
This O
is O
wholly O
unexpected O
; O
I O
had O
not O
an O
idea O
of O
it O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
added O
, O
in O
his O
letter O
, O
that O
they O
might O
expect O
to O
see O
their O
father O
at O
home O
on O
the O
following O
day O
, O
which O
was O
Saturday O
. O
Rendered O
spiritless O
by O
the O
ill O
success O
of O
all O
their O
endeavours O
, O
he O
had O
yielded O
to O
his O
brother-in-law O
's O
entreaty O
that O
he O
would O
return O
to O
his O
family O
and O
leave O
it O
to O
him O
to O
do O
whatever O
occasion O
might O
suggest O
to O
be O
advisable O
for O
continuing O
their O
pursuit O
. O
When O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
told O
of O
this O
, O
she O
did O
not O
express O
so O
much O
satisfaction O
as O
her O
children O
expected O
, O
considering O
what O
her O
anxiety O
for O
his O
life O
had O
been O
before O
. O
" O
What O
! O
is O
he O
coming O
home O
, O
and O
without O
poor O
Lydia O
? O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
Sure O
he O
will O
not O
leave O
London O
before O
he O
has O
found O
them O
. O
Who O
is O
to O
fight O
Wickham O
, O
and O
make O
him O
marry O
her O
, O
if O
he O
comes O
away O
? O
" O
As O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
began O
to O
wish O
to O
be O
at O
home O
, O
it O
was O
settled O
that O
she O
and O
her O
children O
should O
go O
to O
London O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
Mr. O
Bennet O
came O
from O
it O
. O
The O
coach O
, O
therefore O
, O
took O
them O
the O
first O
stage O
of O
their O
journey O
, O
and O
brought O
its O
master O
back O
to O
Longbourn O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
went O
away O
in O
all O
the O
perplexity O
about O
Elizabeth O
and O
her O
Derbyshire O
friend O
, O
that O
had O
attended O
her O
from O
that O
part O
of O
the O
world O
. O
His O
name O
had O
never O
been O
voluntarily O
mentioned O
before O
them O
by O
her O
niece O
; O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
half-expectation O
which O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
had O
formed O
, O
of O
their O
being O
followed O
by O
a O
letter O
from O
him O
, O
had O
ended O
in O
nothing O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
received O
none O
since O
her O
return O
, O
that O
could O
come O
from O
Pemberley O
. O
The O
present O
unhappy O
state O
of O
the O
family O
rendered O
any O
other O
excuse O
for O
the O
lowness O
of O
her O
spirits O
unnecessary O
; O
nothing O
, O
therefore O
, O
could O
be O
fairly O
conjectured O
from O
_that_ O
, O
-- O
though O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
was O
by O
this O
time O
tolerably O
well O
acquainted O
with O
her O
own O
feelings O
, O
was O
perfectly O
aware O
that O
, O
had O
she O
known O
nothing O
of O
Darcy O
, O
she O
could O
have O
borne O
the O
dread O
of O
Lydia O
's O
infamy O
somewhat O
better O
. O
It O
would O
have O
spared O
her O
, O
she O
thought O
, O
one O
sleepless O
night O
out O
of O
two O
. O
When O
Mr. O
Bennet O
arrived O
, O
he O
had O
all O
the O
appearance O
of O
his O
usual O
philosophic O
composure O
. O
He O
said O
as O
little O
as O
he O
had O
ever O
been O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
saying O
; O
made O
no O
mention O
of O
the O
business O
that O
had O
taken O
him O
away O
; O
and O
it O
was O
some O
time O
before O
his O
daughters O
had O
courage O
to O
speak O
of O
it O
. O
It O
was O
not O
till O
the O
afternoon O
, O
when O
he O
joined O
them O
at O
tea O
, O
that O
Elizabeth O
ventured O
to O
introduce O
the O
subject O
; O
and O
then O
, O
on O
her O
briefly O
expressing O
her O
sorrow O
for O
what O
he O
must O
have O
endured O
, O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
Say O
nothing O
of O
that O
. O
Who O
should O
suffer O
but O
myself O
? O
It O
has O
been O
my O
own O
doing O
, O
and O
I O
ought O
to O
feel O
it O
. O
" O
" O
You O
must O
not O
be O
too O
severe O
upon O
yourself O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
You O
may O
well O
warn O
me O
against O
such O
an O
evil O
. O
Human O
nature O
is O
so O
prone O
to O
fall O
into O
it O
! O
No O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
let O
me O
once O
in O
my O
life O
feel O
how O
much O
I O
have O
been O
to O
blame O
. O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
of O
being O
overpowered O
by O
the O
impression O
. O
It O
will O
pass O
away O
soon O
enough O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
suppose O
them O
to O
be O
in O
London O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
where O
else O
can O
they O
be O
so O
well O
concealed O
? O
" O
" O
And O
Lydia O
used O
to O
want O
to O
go O
to O
London O
, O
" O
added O
Kitty O
. O
" O
She O
is O
happy O
, O
then O
, O
" O
said O
her O
father O
, O
drily O
; O
" O
and O
her O
residence O
there O
will O
probably O
be O
of O
some O
duration O
. O
" O
Then O
, O
after O
a O
short O
silence O
, O
he O
continued O
, O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
I O
bear O
you O
no O
ill-will O
for O
being O
justified O
in O
your O
advice O
to O
me O
last O
May O
, O
which O
, O
considering O
the O
event O
, O
shows O
some O
greatness O
of O
mind O
. O
" O
They O
were O
interrupted O
by O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
who O
came O
to O
fetch O
her O
mother O
's O
tea O
. O
" O
This O
is O
a O
parade O
, O
" O
cried O
he O
, O
" O
which O
does O
one O
good O
; O
it O
gives O
such O
an O
elegance O
to O
misfortune O
! O
Another O
day O
I O
will O
do O
the O
same O
; O
I O
will O
sit O
in O
my O
library O
, O
in O
my O
nightcap O
and O
powdering O
gown O
, O
and O
give O
as O
much O
trouble O
as O
I O
can O
, O
-- O
or O
perhaps O
I O
may O
defer O
it O
till O
Kitty O
runs O
away O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
going O
to O
run O
away O
, O
papa O
, O
" O
said O
Kitty O
, O
fretfully O
. O
" O
If O
_I_ O
should O
ever O
go O
to O
Brighton O
, O
I O
would O
behave O
better O
than O
Lydia O
. O
" O
" O
_You_ O
go O
to O
Brighton O
! O
I O
would O
not O
trust O
you O
so O
near O
it O
as O
Eastbourne O
, O
for O
fifty O
pounds O
! O
No O
, O
Kitty O
, O
I O
have O
at O
least O
learnt O
to O
be O
cautious O
, O
and O
you O
will O
feel O
the O
effects O
of O
it O
. O
No O
officer O
is O
ever O
to O
enter O
my O
house O
again O
, O
nor O
even O
to O
pass O
through O
the O
village O
. O
Balls O
will O
be O
absolutely O
prohibited O
, O
unless O
you O
stand O
up O
with O
one O
of O
your O
sisters O
. O
And O
you O
are O
never O
to O
stir O
out O
of O
doors O
, O
till O
you O
can O
prove O
that O
you O
have O
spent O
ten O
minutes O
of O
every O
day O
in O
a O
rational O
manner O
. O
" O
Kitty O
, O
who O
took O
all O
these O
threats O
in O
a O
serious O
light O
, O
began O
to O
cry O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
do O
not O
make O
yourself O
unhappy O
. O
If O
you O
are O
a O
good O
girl O
for O
the O
next O
ten O
years O
, O
I O
will O
take O
you O
to O
a O
review O
at O
the O
end O
of O
them O
. O
