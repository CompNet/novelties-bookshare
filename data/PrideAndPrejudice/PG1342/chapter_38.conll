On O
Saturday O
morning O
Elizabeth O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
met O
for O
breakfast O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
the O
others O
appeared O
; O
and O
he O
took O
the O
opportunity O
of O
paying O
the O
parting O
civilities O
which O
he O
deemed O
indispensably O
necessary O
. O
" O
I O
know O
not O
, O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
whether O
Mrs. O
Collins O
has O
yet O
expressed O
her O
sense O
of O
your O
kindness O
in O
coming O
to O
us O
; O
but O
I O
am O
very O
certain O
you O
will O
not O
leave O
the O
house O
without O
receiving O
her O
thanks O
for O
it O
. O
The O
favour O
of O
your O
company O
has O
been O
much O
felt O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
. O
We O
know O
how O
little O
there O
is O
to O
tempt O
anyone O
to O
our O
humble O
abode O
. O
Our O
plain O
manner O
of O
living O
, O
our O
small O
rooms O
, O
and O
few O
domestics O
, O
and O
the O
little O
we O
see O
of O
the O
world O
, O
must O
make O
Hunsford O
extremely O
dull O
to O
a O
young O
lady O
like O
yourself O
; O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
believe O
us O
grateful O
for O
the O
condescension O
, O
and O
that O
we O
have O
done O
everything O
in O
our O
power O
to O
prevent O
you O
spending O
your O
time O
unpleasantly O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
eager O
with O
her O
thanks O
and O
assurances O
of O
happiness O
. O
She O
had O
spent O
six O
weeks O
with O
great O
enjoyment O
; O
and O
the O
pleasure O
of O
being O
with O
Charlotte O
, O
and O
the O
kind O
attention O
she O
had O
received O
, O
must O
make O
_her_ O
feel O
the O
obliged O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
gratified O
; O
and O
with O
a O
more O
smiling O
solemnity O
replied O
, O
-- O
" O
It O
gives O
me O
the O
greatest O
pleasure O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
have O
passed O
your O
time O
not O
disagreeably O
. O
We O
have O
certainly O
done O
our O
best O
; O
and O
most O
fortunately O
having O
it O
in O
our O
power O
to O
introduce O
you O
to O
very O
superior O
society O
, O
and O
from O
our O
connection O
with O
Rosings O
, O
the O
frequent O
means O
of O
varying O
the O
humble O
home O
scene O
, O
I O
think O
we O
may O
flatter O
ourselves O
that O
your O
Hunsford O
visit O
can O
not O
have O
been O
entirely O
irksome O
. O
Our O
situation O
with O
regard O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
family O
is O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
sort O
of O
extraordinary O
advantage O
and O
blessing O
which O
few O
can O
boast O
. O
You O
see O
on O
what O
a O
footing O
we O
are O
. O
You O
see O
how O
continually O
we O
are O
engaged O
there O
. O
In O
truth O
, O
I O
must O
acknowledge O
, O
that O
, O
with O
all O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
this O
humble O
parsonage O
, O
I O
should O
not O
think O
anyone O
abiding O
in O
it O
an O
object O
of O
compassion O
, O
while O
they O
are O
sharers O
of O
our O
intimacy O
at O
Rosings O
. O
" O
Words O
were O
insufficient O
for O
the O
elevation O
of O
his O
feelings O
; O
and O
he O
was O
obliged O
to O
walk O
about O
the O
room O
, O
while O
Elizabeth O
tried O
to O
unite O
civility O
and O
truth O
in O
a O
few O
short O
sentences O
. O
" O
You O
may O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
carry O
a O
very O
favourable O
report O
of O
us O
into O
Hertfordshire O
, O
my O
dear O
cousin O
. O
I O
flatter O
myself O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
great O
attentions O
to O
Mrs. O
Collins O
you O
have O
been O
a O
daily O
witness O
of O
; O
and O
altogether O
I O
trust O
it O
does O
not O
appear O
that O
your O
friend O
has O
drawn O
an O
unfortunate O
-- O
but O
on O
this O
point O
it O
will O
be O
as O
well O
to O
be O
silent O
. O
Only O
let O
me O
assure O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
, O
that O
I O
can O
from O
my O
heart O
most O
cordially O
wish O
you O
equal O
felicity O
in O
marriage O
. O
My O
dear O
Charlotte O
and O
I O
have O
but O
one O
mind O
and O
one O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O
There O
is O
in O
everything O
a O
most O
remarkable O
resemblance O
of O
character O
and O
ideas O
between O
us O
. O
We O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
designed O
for O
each O
other O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
safely O
say O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
happiness O
where O
that O
was O
the O
case O
, O
and O
with O
equal O
sincerity O
could O
add O
, O
that O
she O
firmly O
believed O
and O
rejoiced O
in O
his O
domestic O
comforts O
. O
She O
was O
not O
sorry O
, O
however O
, O
to O
have O
the O
recital O
of O
them O
interrupted O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
lady O
from O
whom O
they O
sprang O
. O
Poor O
Charlotte O
! O
it O
was O
melancholy O
to O
leave O
her O
to O
such O
society O
! O
But O
she O
had O
chosen O
it O
with O
her O
eyes O
open O
; O
and O
though O
evidently O
regretting O
that O
her O
visitors O
were O
to O
go O
, O
she O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
ask O
for O
compassion O
. O
Her O
home O
and O
her O
housekeeping O
, O
her O
parish O
and O
her O
poultry O
, O
and O
all O
their O
dependent O
concerns O
, O
had O
not O
yet O
lost O
their O
charms O
. O
At O
length O
the O
chaise O
arrived O
, O
the O
trunks O
were O
fastened O
on O
, O
the O
parcels O
placed O
within O
, O
and O
it O
was O
pronounced O
to O
be O
ready O
. O
After O
an O
affectionate O
parting O
between O
the O
friends O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
attended O
to O
the O
carriage O
by O
Mr. O
Collins O
; O
and O
as O
they O
walked O
down O
the O
garden O
, O
he O
was O
commissioning O
her O
with O
his O
best O
respects O
to O
all O
her O
family O
, O
not O
forgetting O
his O
thanks O
for O
the O
kindness O
he O
had O
received O
at O
Longbourn O
in O
the O
winter O
, O
and O
his O
compliments O
to O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
though O
unknown O
. O
He O
then O
handed O
her O
in O
, O
Maria O
followed O
, O
and O
the O
door O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
being O
closed O
, O
when O
he O
suddenly O
reminded O
them O
, O
with O
some O
consternation O
, O
that O
they O
had O
hitherto O
forgotten O
to O
leave O
any O
message O
for O
the O
ladies O
of O
Rosings O
. O
" O
But O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
" O
you O
will O
of O
course O
wish O
to O
have O
your O
humble O
respects O
delivered O
to O
them O
, O
with O
your O
grateful O
thanks O
for O
their O
kindness O
to O
you O
while O
you O
have O
been O
here O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
made O
no O
objection O
: O
the O
door O
was O
then O
allowed O
to O
be O
shut O
, O
and O
the O
carriage O
drove O
off O
. O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
" O
cried O
Maria O
, O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
' O
silence O
, O
" O
it O
seems O
but O
a O
day O
or O
two O
since O
we O
first O
came O
! O
and O
yet O
how O
many O
things O
have O
happened O
! O
" O
" O
A O
great O
many O
indeed O
, O
" O
said O
her O
companion O
, O
with O
a O
sigh O
. O
" O
We O
have O
dined O
nine O
times O
at O
Rosings O
, O
besides O
drinking O
tea O
there O
twice O
! O
How O
much O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
tell O
! O
" O
Elizabeth O
privately O
added O
, O
" O
And O
how O
much O
I O
shall O
have O
to O
conceal O
! O
" O
Their O
journey O
was O
performed O
without O
much O
conversation O
, O
or O
any O
alarm O
; O
and O
within O
four O
hours O
of O
their O
leaving O
Hunsford O
they O
reached O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
's O
house O
, O
where O
they O
were O
to O
remain O
a O
few O
days O
. O
Jane O
looked O
well O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
had O
little O
opportunity O
of O
studying O
her O
spirits O
, O
amidst O
the O
various O
engagements O
which O
the O
kindness O
of O
her O
aunt O
had O
reserved O
for O
them O
. O
But O
Jane O
was O
to O
go O
home O
with O
her O
, O
and O
at O
Longbourn O
there O
would O
be O
leisure O
enough O
for O
observation O
. O
It O
was O
not O
without O
an O
effort O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
that O
she O
could O
wait O
even O
for O
Longbourn O
, O
before O
she O
told O
her O
sister O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
proposals O
. O
To O
know O
that O
she O
had O
the O
power O
of O
revealing O
what O
would O
so O
exceedingly O
astonish O
Jane O
, O
and O
must O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
so O
highly O
gratify O
whatever O
of O
her O
own O
vanity O
she O
had O
not O
yet O
been O
able O
to O
reason O
away O
, O
was O
such O
a O
temptation O
to O
openness O
as O
nothing O
could O
have O
conquered O
, O
but O
the O
state O
of O
indecision O
in O
which O
she O
remained O
as O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
what O
she O
should O
communicate O
, O
and O
her O
fear O
, O
if O
she O
once O
entered O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
of O
being O
hurried O
into O
repeating O
something O
of O
Bingley O
, O
which O
might O
only O
grieve O
her O
sister O
further O
. O
