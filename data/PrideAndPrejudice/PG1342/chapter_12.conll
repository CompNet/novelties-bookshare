In O
consequence O
of O
an O
agreement O
between O
the O
sisters O
, O
Elizabeth O
wrote O
the O
next O
morning O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
to O
beg O
that O
the O
carriage O
might O
be O
sent O
for O
them O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
day O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
who O
had O
calculated O
on O
her O
daughters O
remaining O
at O
Netherfield O
till O
the O
following O
Tuesday O
, O
which O
would O
exactly O
finish O
Jane O
's O
week O
, O
could O
not O
bring O
herself O
to O
receive O
them O
with O
pleasure O
before O
. O
Her O
answer O
, O
therefore O
, O
was O
not O
propitious O
, O
at O
least O
not O
to O
Elizabeth O
's O
wishes O
, O
for O
she O
was O
impatient O
to O
get O
home O
. O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
sent O
them O
word O
that O
they O
could O
not O
possibly O
have O
the O
carriage O
before O
Tuesday O
; O
and O
in O
her O
postscript O
it O
was O
added O
, O
that O
if O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
his O
sister O
pressed O
them O
to O
stay O
longer O
, O
she O
could O
spare O
them O
very O
well O
. O
Against O
staying O
longer O
, O
however O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
positively O
resolved O
-- O
nor O
did O
she O
much O
expect O
it O
would O
be O
asked O
; O
and O
fearful O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
of O
being O
considered O
as O
intruding O
themselves O
needlessly O
long O
, O
she O
urged O
Jane O
to O
borrow O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
carriage O
immediately O
, O
and O
at O
length O
it O
was O
settled O
that O
their O
original O
design O
of O
leaving O
Netherfield O
that O
morning O
should O
be O
mentioned O
, O
and O
the O
request O
made O
. O
The O
communication O
excited O
many O
professions O
of O
concern O
; O
and O
enough O
was O
said O
of O
wishing O
them O
to O
stay O
at O
least O
till O
the O
following O
day O
to O
work O
on O
Jane O
; O
and O
till O
the O
morrow O
their O
going O
was O
deferred O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
then O
sorry O
that O
she O
had O
proposed O
the O
delay O
; O
for O
her O
jealousy O
and O
dislike O
of O
one O
sister O
much O
exceeded O
her O
affection O
for O
the O
other O
. O
The O
master O
of O
the O
house O
heard O
with O
real O
sorrow O
that O
they O
were O
to O
go O
so O
soon O
, O
and O
repeatedly O
tried O
to O
persuade O
Miss O
Bennet O
that O
it O
would O
not O
be O
safe O
for O
her O
-- O
that O
she O
was O
not O
enough O
recovered O
; O
but O
Jane O
was O
firm O
where O
she O
felt O
herself O
to O
be O
right O
. O
To O
Mr. O
Darcy O
it O
was O
welcome O
intelligence O
: O
Elizabeth O
had O
been O
at O
Netherfield O
long O
enough O
. O
She O
attracted O
him O
more O
than O
he O
liked O
; O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
uncivil O
to O
_her_ O
and O
more O
teasing O
than O
usual O
to O
himself O
. O
He O
wisely O
resolved O
to O
be O
particularly O
careful O
that O
no O
sign O
of O
admiration O
should O
_now_ O
escape O
him O
-- O
nothing O
that O
could O
elevate O
her O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
influencing O
his O
felicity O
; O
sensible O
that O
, O
if O
such O
an O
idea O
had O
been O
suggested O
, O
his O
behaviour O
during O
the O
last O
day O
must O
have O
material O
weight O
in O
confirming O
or O
crushing O
it O
. O
Steady O
to O
his O
purpose O
, O
he O
scarcely O
spoke O
ten O
words O
to O
her O
through O
the O
whole O
of O
Saturday O
: O
and O
though O
they O
were O
at O
one O
time O
left O
by O
themselves O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
he O
adhered O
most O
conscientiously O
to O
his O
book O
, O
and O
would O
not O
even O
look O
at O
her O
. O
On O
Sunday O
, O
after O
morning O
service O
, O
the O
separation O
, O
so O
agreeable O
to O
almost O
all O
, O
took O
place O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
civility O
to O
Elizabeth O
increased O
at O
last O
very O
rapidly O
, O
as O
well O
as O
her O
affection O
for O
Jane O
; O
and O
when O
they O
parted O
, O
after O
assuring O
the O
latter O
of O
the O
pleasure O
it O
would O
always O
give O
her O
to O
see O
her O
either O
at O
Longbourn O
or O
Netherfield O
, O
and O
embracing O
her O
most O
tenderly O
, O
she O
even O
shook O
hands O
with O
the O
former O
. O
Elizabeth O
took O
leave O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
in O
the O
liveliest O
spirits O
. O
They O
were O
not O
welcomed O
home O
very O
cordially O
by O
their O
mother O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
wondered O
at O
their O
coming O
, O
and O
thought O
them O
very O
wrong O
to O
give O
so O
much O
trouble O
, O
and O
was O
sure O
Jane O
would O
have O
caught O
cold O
again O
. O
But O
their O
father O
, O
though O
very O
laconic O
in O
his O
expressions O
of O
pleasure O
, O
was O
really O
glad O
to O
see O
them O
; O
he O
had O
felt O
their O
importance O
in O
the O
family O
circle O
. O
The O
evening O
conversation O
, O
when O
they O
were O
all O
assembled O
, O
had O
lost O
much O
of O
its O
animation O
, O
and O
almost O
all O
its O
sense O
, O
by O
the O
absence O
of O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
. O
They O
found O
Mary O
, O
as O
usual O
, O
deep O
in O
the O
study O
of O
thorough O
bass O
and O
human O
nature O
; O
and O
had O
some O
new O
extracts O
to O
admire O
and O
some O
new O
observations O
of O
threadbare O
morality O
to O
listen O
to O
. O
Catherine O
and O
Lydia O
had O
information O
for O
them O
of O
a O
different O
sort O
. O
Much O
had O
been O
done O
, O
and O
much O
had O
been O
said O
in O
the O
regiment O
since O
the O
preceding O
Wednesday O
; O
several O
of O
the O
officers O
had O
dined O
lately O
with O
their O
uncle O
; O
a O
private O
had O
been O
flogged O
; O
and O
it O
had O
actually O
been O
hinted O
that O
Colonel O
Forster O
was O
going O
to O
be O
married O
. O
