The O
first O
week O
of O
their O
return O
was O
soon O
gone O
. O
The O
second O
began O
. O
It O
was O
the O
last O
of O
the O
regiment O
's O
stay O
in O
Meryton O
, O
and O
all O
the O
young O
ladies O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
were O
drooping O
apace O
. O
The O
dejection O
was O
almost O
universal O
. O
The O
elder O
Miss O
Bennets O
alone O
were O
still O
able O
to O
eat O
, O
drink O
, O
and O
sleep O
, O
and O
pursue O
the O
usual O
course O
of O
their O
employments O
. O
Very O
frequently O
were O
they O
reproached O
for O
this O
insensibility O
by O
Kitty O
and O
Lydia O
, O
whose O
own O
misery O
was O
extreme O
, O
and O
who O
could O
not O
comprehend O
such O
hard-heartedness O
in O
any O
of O
the O
family O
. O
" O
Good O
Heaven O
! O
What O
is O
to O
become O
of O
us O
? O
What O
are O
we O
to O
do O
? O
" O
would O
they O
often O
exclaim O
in O
the O
bitterness O
of O
woe O
. O
" O
How O
can O
you O
be O
smiling O
so O
, O
Lizzy O
? O
" O
Their O
affectionate O
mother O
shared O
all O
their O
grief O
; O
she O
remembered O
what O
she O
had O
herself O
endured O
on O
a O
similar O
occasion O
five-and-twenty O
years O
ago O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
cried O
for O
two O
days O
together O
when O
Colonel O
Miller O
's O
regiment O
went O
away O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
have O
broke O
my O
heart O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
shall O
break O
_mine_ O
, O
" O
said O
Lydia O
. O
" O
If O
one O
could O
but O
go O
to O
Brighton O
! O
" O
observed O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
. O
" O
Oh O
yes O
! O
-- O
if O
one O
could O
but O
go O
to O
Brighton O
! O
But O
papa O
is O
so O
disagreeable O
. O
" O
" O
A O
little O
sea-bathing O
would O
set O
me O
up O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
" O
And O
my O
aunt O
Philips O
is O
sure O
it O
would O
do O
_me_ O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
, O
" O
added O
Kitty O
. O
Such O
were O
the O
kind O
of O
lamentations O
resounding O
perpetually O
through O
Longbourn O
House O
. O
Elizabeth O
tried O
to O
be O
diverted O
by O
them O
; O
but O
all O
sense O
of O
pleasure O
was O
lost O
in O
shame O
. O
She O
felt O
anew O
the O
justice O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
objections O
; O
and O
never O
had O
she O
before O
been O
so O
much O
disposed O
to O
pardon O
his O
interference O
in O
the O
views O
of O
his O
friend O
. O
But O
the O
gloom O
of O
Lydia O
's O
prospect O
was O
shortly O
cleared O
away O
; O
for O
she O
received O
an O
invitation O
from O
Mrs. O
Forster O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
the O
colonel O
of O
the O
regiment O
, O
to O
accompany O
her O
to O
Brighton O
. O
This O
invaluable O
friend O
was O
a O
very O
young O
woman O
, O
and O
very O
lately O
married O
. O
A O
resemblance O
in O
good-humour O
and O
good O
spirits O
had O
recommended O
her O
and O
Lydia O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
out O
of O
their O
_three_ O
months O
' O
acquaintance O
they O
had O
been O
intimate O
_two_ O
. O
The O
rapture O
of O
Lydia O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
her O
adoration O
of O
Mrs. O
Forster O
, O
the O
delight O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
and O
the O
mortification O
of O
Kitty O
, O
are O
scarcely O
to O
be O
described O
. O
Wholly O
inattentive O
to O
her O
sister O
's O
feelings O
, O
Lydia O
flew O
about O
the O
house O
in O
restless O
ecstasy O
, O
calling O
for O
everyone O
's O
congratulations O
, O
and O
laughing O
and O
talking O
with O
more O
violence O
than O
ever O
; O
whilst O
the O
luckless O
Kitty O
continued O
in O
the O
parlour O
repining O
at O
her O
fate O
in O
terms O
as O
unreasonable O
as O
her O
accent O
was O
peevish O
. O
" O
I O
can O
not O
see O
why O
Mrs. O
Forster O
should O
not O
ask O
_me_ O
as O
well O
as O
Lydia O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
though O
I O
am O
_not_ O
her O
particular O
friend O
. O
I O
have O
just O
as O
much O
right O
to O
be O
asked O
as O
she O
has O
, O
and O
more O
too O
, O
for O
I O
am O
two O
years O
older O
. O
" O
In O
vain O
did O
Elizabeth O
attempt O
to O
make O
her O
reasonable O
, O
and O
Jane O
to O
make O
her O
resigned O
. O
As O
for O
Elizabeth O
herself O
, O
this O
invitation O
was O
so O
far O
from O
exciting O
in O
her O
the O
same O
feelings O
as O
in O
her O
mother O
and O
Lydia O
, O
that O
she O
considered O
it O
as O
the O
death-warrant O
of O
all O
possibility O
of O
common O
sense O
for O
the O
latter O
; O
and O
detestable O
as O
such O
a O
step O
must O
make O
her O
, O
were O
it O
known O
, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
secretly O
advising O
her O
father O
not O
to O
let O
her O
go O
. O
She O
represented O
to O
him O
all O
the O
improprieties O
of O
Lydia O
's O
general O
behaviour O
, O
the O
little O
advantage O
she O
could O
derive O
from O
the O
friendship O
of O
such O
a O
woman O
as O
Mrs. O
Forster O
, O
and O
the O
probability O
of O
her O
being O
yet O
more O
imprudent O
with O
such O
a O
companion O
at O
Brighton O
, O
where O
the O
temptations O
must O
be O
greater O
than O
at O
home O
. O
He O
heard O
her O
attentively O
, O
and O
then O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
Lydia O
will O
never O
be O
easy O
till O
she O
has O
exposed O
herself O
in O
some O
public O
place O
or O
other O
, O
and O
we O
can O
never O
expect O
her O
to O
do O
it O
with O
so O
little O
expense O
or O
inconvenience O
to O
her O
family O
as O
under O
the O
present O
circumstances O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
were O
aware O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
of O
the O
very O
great O
disadvantage O
to O
us O
all O
, O
which O
must O
arise O
from O
the O
public O
notice O
of O
Lydia O
's O
unguarded O
and O
imprudent O
manner O
, O
nay O
, O
which O
has O
already O
arisen O
from O
it O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
would O
judge O
differently O
in O
the O
affair O
. O
" O
" O
Already O
arisen O
! O
" O
repeated O
Mr. O
Bennet O
. O
" O
What O
! O
has O
she O
frightened O
away O
some O
of O
your O
lovers O
? O
Poor O
little O
Lizzy O
! O
But O
do O
not O
be O
cast O
down O
. O
Such O
squeamish O
youths O
as O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
be O
connected O
with O
a O
little O
absurdity O
are O
not O
worth O
a O
regret O
. O
Come O
, O
let O
me O
see O
the O
list O
of O
the O
pitiful O
fellows O
who O
have O
been O
kept O
aloof O
by O
Lydia O
's O
folly O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
you O
are O
mistaken O
. O
I O
have O
no O
such O
injuries O
to O
resent O
. O
It O
is O
not O
of O
peculiar O
, O
but O
of O
general O
evils O
, O
which O
I O
am O
now O
complaining O
. O
Our O
importance O
, O
our O
respectability O
in O
the O
world O
, O
must O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
wild O
volatility O
, O
the O
assurance O
and O
disdain O
of O
all O
restraint O
which O
mark O
Lydia O
's O
character O
. O
Excuse O
me O
, O
-- O
for O
I O
must O
speak O
plainly O
. O
If O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
father O
, O
will O
not O
take O
the O
trouble O
of O
checking O
her O
exuberant O
spirits O
, O
and O
of O
teaching O
her O
that O
her O
present O
pursuits O
are O
not O
to O
be O
the O
business O
of O
her O
life O
, O
she O
will O
soon O
be O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
amendment O
. O
Her O
character O
will O
be O
fixed O
; O
and O
she O
will O
, O
at O
sixteen O
, O
be O
the O
most O
determined O
flirt O
that O
ever O
made O
herself O
and O
her O
family O
ridiculous O
; O
-- O
a O
flirt O
, O
too O
, O
in O
the O
worst O
and O
meanest O
degree O
of O
flirtation O
; O
without O
any O
attraction O
beyond O
youth O
and O
a O
tolerable O
person O
; O
and O
, O
from O
the O
ignorance O
and O
emptiness O
of O
her O
mind O
, O
wholly O
unable O
to O
ward O
off O
any O
portion O
of O
that O
universal O
contempt O
which O
her O
rage O
for O
admiration O
will O
excite O
. O
In O
this O
danger O
Kitty O
is O
also O
comprehended O
. O
She O
will O
follow O
wherever O
Lydia O
leads O
. O
Vain O
, O
ignorant O
, O
idle O
, O
and O
absolutely O
uncontrolled O
! O
Oh O
, O
my O
dear O
father O
, O
can O
you O
suppose O
it O
possible O
that O
they O
will O
not O
be O
censured O
and O
despised O
wherever O
they O
are O
known O
, O
and O
that O
their O
sisters O
will O
not O
be O
often O
involved O
in O
the O
disgrace O
? O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
saw O
that O
her O
whole O
heart O
was O
in O
the O
subject O
; O
and O
, O
affectionately O
taking O
her O
hand O
, O
said O
, O
in O
reply O
, O
-- O
" O
Do O
not O
make O
yourself O
uneasy O
, O
my O
love O
. O
Wherever O
you O
and O
Jane O
are O
known O
, O
you O
must O
be O
respected O
and O
valued O
; O
and O
you O
will O
not O
appear O
to O
less O
advantage O
for O
having O
a O
couple O
of O
-- O
or O
I O
may O
say O
, O
three O
-- O
very O
silly O
sisters O
. O
We O
shall O
have O
no O
peace O
at O
Longbourn O
if O
Lydia O
does O
not O
go O
to O
Brighton O
. O
Let O
her O
go O
, O
then O
. O
Colonel O
Forster O
is O
a O
sensible O
man O
, O
and O
will O
keep O
her O
out O
of O
any O
real O
mischief O
; O
and O
she O
is O
luckily O
too O
poor O
to O
be O
an O
object O
of O
prey O
to O
anybody O
. O
At O
Brighton O
she O
will O
be O
of O
less O
importance O
even O
as O
a O
common O
flirt O
than O
she O
has O
been O
here O
. O
The O
officers O
will O
find O
women O
better O
worth O
their O
notice O
. O
Let O
us O
hope O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
her O
being O
there O
may O
teach O
her O
her O
own O
insignificance O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
she O
can O
not O
grow O
many O
degrees O
worse O
, O
without O
authorizing O
us O
to O
lock O
her O
up O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
life O
. O
" O
With O
this O
answer O
Elizabeth O
was O
forced O
to O
be O
content O
; O
but O
her O
own O
opinion O
continued O
the O
same O
, O
and O
she O
left O
him O
disappointed O
and O
sorry O
. O
It O
was O
not O
in O
her O
nature O
, O
however O
, O
to O
increase O
her O
vexations O
by O
dwelling O
on O
them O
. O
She O
was O
confident O
of O
having O
performed O
her O
duty O
; O
and O
to O
fret O
over O
unavoidable O
evils O
, O
or O
augment O
them O
by O
anxiety O
, O
was O
no O
part O
of O
her O
disposition O
. O
Had O
Lydia O
and O
her O
mother O
known O
the O
substance O
of O
her O
conference O
with O
her O
father O
, O
their O
indignation O
would O
hardly O
have O
found O
expression O
in O
their O
united O
volubility O
. O
In O
Lydia O
's O
imagination O
, O
a O
visit O
to O
Brighton O
comprised O
every O
possibility O
of O
earthly O
happiness O
. O
She O
saw O
, O
with O
the O
creative O
eye O
of O
fancy O
, O
the O
streets O
of O
that O
gay O
bathing-place O
covered O
with O
officers O
. O
She O
saw O
herself O
the O
object O
of O
attention O
to O
tens O
and O
to O
scores O
of O
them O
at O
present O
unknown O
. O
She O
saw O
all O
the O
glories O
of O
the O
camp O
: O
its O
tents O
stretched O
forth O
in O
beauteous O
uniformity O
of O
lines O
, O
crowded O
with O
the O
young O
and O
the O
gay O
, O
and O
dazzling O
with O
scarlet O
; O
and O
, O
to O
complete O
the O
view O
, O
she O
saw O
herself O
seated O
beneath O
a O
tent O
, O
tenderly O
flirting O
with O
at O
least O
six O
officers O
at O
once O
. O
Had O
she O
known O
that O
her O
sister O
sought O
to O
tear O
her O
from O
such O
prospects O
and O
such O
realities O
as O
these O
, O
what O
would O
have O
been O
her O
sensations O
? O
They O
could O
have O
been O
understood O
only O
by O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
might O
have O
felt O
nearly O
the O
same O
. O
Lydia O
's O
going O
to O
Brighton O
was O
all O
that O
consoled O
her O
for O
the O
melancholy O
conviction O
of O
her O
husband O
's O
never O
intending O
to O
go O
there O
himself O
. O
But O
they O
were O
entirely O
ignorant O
of O
what O
had O
passed O
; O
and O
their O
raptures O
continued O
, O
with O
little O
intermission O
, O
to O
the O
very O
day O
of O
Lydia O
's O
leaving O
home O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
now O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Wickham O
for O
the O
last O
time O
. O
Having O
been O
frequently O
in O
company O
with O
him O
since O
her O
return O
, O
agitation O
was O
pretty O
well O
over O
; O
the O
agitations O
of O
former O
partiality O
entirely O
so O
. O
She O
had O
even O
learnt O
to O
detect O
, O
in O
the O
very O
gentleness O
which O
had O
first O
delighted O
her O
, O
an O
affectation O
and O
a O
sameness O
to O
disgust O
and O
weary O
. O
In O
his O
present O
behaviour O
to O
herself O
, O
moreover O
, O
she O
had O
a O
fresh O
source O
of O
displeasure O
; O
for O
the O
inclination O
he O
soon O
testified O
of O
renewing O
those O
attentions O
which O
had O
marked O
the O
early O
part O
of O
their O
acquaintance O
could O
only O
serve O
, O
after O
what O
had O
since O
passed O
, O
to O
provoke O
her O
. O
She O
lost O
all O
concern O
for O
him O
in O
finding O
herself O
thus O
selected O
as O
the O
object O
of O
such O
idle O
and O
frivolous O
gallantry O
; O
and O
while O
she O
steadily O
repressed O
it O
, O
could O
not O
but O
feel O
the O
reproof O
contained O
in O
his O
believing O
, O
that O
however O
long O
, O
and O
for O
whatever O
cause O
, O
his O
attentions O
had O
been O
withdrawn O
, O
her O
vanity O
would O
be O
gratified O
, O
and O
her O
preference O
secured O
, O
at O
any O
time O
, O
by O
their O
renewal O
. O
On O
the O
very O
last O
day O
of O
the O
regiment O
's O
remaining O
in O
Meryton O
, O
he O
dined O
, O
with O
others O
of O
the O
officers O
, O
at O
Longbourn O
; O
and O
so O
little O
was O
Elizabeth O
disposed O
to O
part O
from O
him O
in O
good-humour O
, O
that O
, O
on O
his O
making O
some O
inquiry O
as O
to O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
her O
time O
had O
passed O
at O
Hunsford O
, O
she O
mentioned O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
's O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
having O
both O
spent O
three O
weeks O
at O
Rosings O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
were O
acquainted O
with O
the O
former O
. O
He O
looked O
surprised O
, O
displeased O
, O
alarmed O
; O
but O
, O
with O
a O
moment O
's O
recollection O
, O
and O
a O
returning O
smile O
, O
replied O
, O
that O
he O
had O
formerly O
seen O
him O
often O
; O
and O
, O
after O
observing O
that O
he O
was O
a O
very O
gentlemanlike O
man O
, O
asked O
her O
how O
she O
had O
liked O
him O
. O
Her O
answer O
was O
warmly O
in O
his O
favour O
. O
With O
an O
air O
of O
indifference O
, O
he O
soon O
afterwards O
added O
, O
" O
How O
long O
did O
you O
say O
that O
he O
was O
at O
Rosings O
? O
" O
" O
Nearly O
three O
weeks O
. O
" O
" O
And O
you O
saw O
him O
frequently O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
almost O
every O
day O
. O
" O
" O
His O
manners O
are O
very O
different O
from O
his O
cousin O
's O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
very O
different O
; O
but O
I O
think O
Mr. O
Darcy O
improves O
on O
acquaintance O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
! O
" O
cried O
Wickham O
, O
with O
a O
look O
which O
did O
not O
escape O
her O
. O
" O
And O
pray O
may O
I O
ask O
-- O
" O
but O
checking O
himself O
, O
he O
added O
, O
in O
a O
gayer O
tone O
, O
" O
Is O
it O
in O
address O
that O
he O
improves O
? O
Has O
he O
deigned O
to O
add O
aught O
of O
civility O
to O
his O
ordinary O
style O
? O
for O
I O
dare O
not O
hope O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
in O
a O
lower O
and O
more O
serious O
tone O
, O
" O
that O
he O
is O
improved O
in O
essentials O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
no O
! O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
In O
essentials O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
he O
is O
very O
much O
what O
he O
ever O
was O
. O
" O
While O
she O
spoke O
, O
Wickham O
looked O
as O
if O
scarcely O
knowing O
whether O
to O
rejoice O
over O
her O
words O
or O
to O
distrust O
their O
meaning O
. O
There O
was O
a O
something O
in O
her O
countenance O
which O
made O
him O
listen O
with O
an O
apprehensive O
and O
anxious O
attention O
, O
while O
she O
added O
, O
-- O
" O
When O
I O
said O
that O
he O
improved O
on O
acquaintance O
, O
I O
did O
not O
mean O
that O
either O
his O
mind O
or O
manners O
were O
in O
a O
state O
of O
improvement O
; O
but O
that O
, O
from O
knowing O
him O
better O
, O
his O
disposition O
was O
better O
understood O
. O
" O
Wickham O
's O
alarm O
now O
appeared O
in O
a O
heightened O
complexion O
and O
agitated O
look O
; O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
he O
was O
silent O
; O
till O
, O
shaking O
off O
his O
embarrassment O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
her O
again O
, O
and O
said O
in O
the O
gentlest O
of O
accents O
, O
-- O
" O
You O
, O
who O
so O
well O
know O
my O
feelings O
towards O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
will O
readily O
comprehend O
how O
sincerely O
I O
must O
rejoice O
that O
he O
is O
wise O
enough O
to O
assume O
even O
the O
_appearance_ O
of O
what O
is O
right O
. O
His O
pride O
, O
in O
that O
direction O
, O
may O
be O
of O
service O
, O
if O
not O
to O
himself O
, O
to O
many O
others O
, O
for O
it O
must O
deter O
him O
from O
such O
foul O
misconduct O
as O
I O
have O
suffered O
by O
. O
I O
only O
fear O
that O
the O
sort O
of O
cautiousness O
to O
which O
you O
, O
I O
imagine O
, O
have O
been O
alluding O
, O
is O
merely O
adopted O
on O
his O
visits O
to O
his O
aunt O
, O
of O
whose O
good O
opinion O
and O
judgment O
he O
stands O
much O
in O
awe O
. O
His O
fear O
of O
her O
has O
always O
operated O
, O
I O
know O
, O
when O
they O
were O
together O
; O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
is O
to O
be O
imputed O
to O
his O
wish O
of O
forwarding O
the O
match O
with O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
which O
I O
am O
certain O
he O
has O
very O
much O
at O
heart O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
repress O
a O
smile O
at O
this O
, O
but O
she O
answered O
only O
by O
a O
slight O
inclination O
of O
the O
head O
. O
She O
saw O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
engage O
her O
on O
the O
old O
subject O
of O
his O
grievances O
, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
no O
humour O
to O
indulge O
him O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
evening O
passed O
with O
the O
_appearance_ O
, O
on O
his O
side O
, O
of O
usual O
cheerfulness O
, O
but O
with O
no O
further O
attempt O
to O
distinguish O
Elizabeth O
; O
and O
they O
parted O
at O
last O
with O
mutual O
civility O
, O
and O
possibly O
a O
mutual O
desire O
of O
never O
meeting O
again O
. O
When O
the O
party O
broke O
up O
, O
Lydia O
returned O
with O
Mrs. O
Forster O
to O
Meryton O
, O
from O
whence O
they O
were O
to O
set O
out O
early O
the O
next O
morning O
. O
The O
separation O
between O
her O
and O
her O
family O
was O
rather O
noisy O
than O
pathetic O
. O
Kitty O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
shed O
tears O
; O
but O
she O
did O
weep O
from O
vexation O
and O
envy O
. O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
was O
diffuse O
in O
her O
good O
wishes O
for O
the O
felicity O
of O
her O
daughter O
, O
and O
impressive O
in O
her O
injunctions O
that O
she O
would O
not O
miss O
the O
opportunity O
of O
enjoying O
herself O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
-- O
advice O
which O
there O
was O
every O
reason O
to O
believe O
would O
be O
attended O
to O
; O
and O
, O
in O
the O
clamorous O
happiness O
of O
Lydia O
herself O
in O
bidding O
farewell O
, O
the O
more O
gentle O
adieus O
of O
her O
sisters O
were O
uttered O
without O
being O
heard O
. O
