Mr. O
Collins O
was O
not O
left O
long O
to O
the O
silent O
contemplation O
of O
his O
successful O
love O
; O
for O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
having O
dawdled O
about O
in O
the O
vestibule O
to O
watch O
for O
the O
end O
of O
the O
conference O
, O
no O
sooner O
saw O
Elizabeth O
open O
the O
door O
and O
with O
quick O
step O
pass O
her O
towards O
the O
staircase O
, O
than O
she O
entered O
the O
breakfast-room O
, O
and O
congratulated O
both O
him O
and O
herself O
in O
warm O
terms O
on O
the O
happy O
prospect O
of O
their O
nearer O
connection O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
received O
and O
returned O
these O
felicitations O
with O
equal O
pleasure O
, O
and O
then O
proceeded O
to O
relate O
the O
particulars O
of O
their O
interview O
, O
with O
the O
result O
of O
which O
he O
trusted O
he O
had O
every O
reason O
to O
be O
satisfied O
, O
since O
the O
refusal O
which O
his O
cousin O
had O
steadfastly O
given O
him O
would O
naturally O
flow O
from O
her O
bashful O
modesty O
and O
the O
genuine O
delicacy O
of O
her O
character O
. O
This O
information O
, O
however O
, O
startled O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
: O
she O
would O
have O
been O
glad O
to O
be O
equally O
satisfied O
that O
her O
daughter O
had O
meant O
to O
encourage O
him O
by O
protesting O
against O
his O
proposals O
, O
but O
she O
dared O
not O
believe O
it O
, O
and O
could O
not O
help O
saying O
so O
. O
" O
But O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
that O
Lizzy O
shall O
be O
brought O
to O
reason O
. O
I O
will O
speak O
to O
her O
about O
it O
myself O
directly O
. O
She O
is O
a O
very O
headstrong O
, O
foolish O
girl O
, O
and O
does O
not O
know O
her O
own O
interest O
; O
but O
I O
will O
_make_ O
her O
know O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Pardon O
me O
for O
interrupting O
you O
, O
madam O
, O
" O
cried O
Mr. O
Collins O
; O
" O
but O
if O
she O
is O
really O
headstrong O
and O
foolish O
, O
I O
know O
not O
whether O
she O
would O
altogether O
be O
a O
very O
desirable O
wife O
to O
a O
man O
in O
my O
situation O
, O
who O
naturally O
looks O
for O
happiness O
in O
the O
marriage O
state O
. O
If O
, O
therefore O
, O
she O
actually O
persists O
in O
rejecting O
my O
suit O
, O
perhaps O
it O
were O
better O
not O
to O
force O
her O
into O
accepting O
me O
, O
because O
, O
if O
liable O
to O
such O
defects O
of O
temper O
, O
she O
could O
not O
contribute O
much O
to O
my O
felicity O
. O
" O
" O
Sir O
, O
you O
quite O
misunderstand O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
alarmed O
. O
" O
Lizzy O
is O
only O
headstrong O
in O
such O
matters O
as O
these O
. O
In O
everything O
else O
she O
is O
as O
good-natured O
a O
girl O
as O
ever O
lived O
. O
I O
will O
go O
directly O
to O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
very O
soon O
settle O
it O
with O
her O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
. O
" O
She O
would O
not O
give O
him O
time O
to O
reply O
, O
but O
hurrying O
instantly O
to O
her O
husband O
, O
called O
out O
, O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
library O
, O
-- O
" O
Oh O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
you O
are O
wanted O
immediately O
; O
we O
are O
all O
in O
an O
uproar O
. O
You O
must O
come O
and O
make O
Lizzy O
marry O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
for O
she O
vows O
she O
will O
not O
have O
him O
; O
and O
if O
you O
do O
not O
make O
haste O
he O
will O
change O
his O
mind O
and O
not O
have O
_her_ O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
raised O
his O
eyes O
from O
his O
book O
as O
she O
entered O
, O
and O
fixed O
them O
on O
her O
face O
with O
a O
calm O
unconcern O
, O
which O
was O
not O
in O
the O
least O
altered O
by O
her O
communication O
. O
" O
I O
have O
not O
the O
pleasure O
of O
understanding O
you O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
when O
she O
had O
finished O
her O
speech O
. O
" O
Of O
what O
are O
you O
talking O
? O
" O
" O
Of O
Mr. O
Collins O
and O
Lizzy O
. O
Lizzy O
declares O
she O
will O
not O
have O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
begins O
to O
say O
that O
he O
will O
not O
have O
Lizzy O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
am O
I O
to O
do O
on O
the O
occasion O
? O
It O
seems O
a O
hopeless O
business O
. O
" O
" O
Speak O
to O
Lizzy O
about O
it O
yourself O
. O
Tell O
her O
that O
you O
insist O
upon O
her O
marrying O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Let O
her O
be O
called O
down O
. O
She O
shall O
hear O
my O
opinion O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
rang O
the O
bell O
, O
and O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
was O
summoned O
to O
the O
library O
. O
" O
Come O
here O
, O
child O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
father O
as O
she O
appeared O
. O
" O
I O
have O
sent O
for O
you O
on O
an O
affair O
of O
importance O
. O
I O
understand O
that O
Mr. O
Collins O
has O
made O
you O
an O
offer O
of O
marriage O
. O
Is O
it O
true O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
replied O
that O
it O
was O
. O
" O
Very O
well O
-- O
and O
this O
offer O
of O
marriage O
you O
have O
refused O
? O
" O
" O
I O
have O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
well O
. O
We O
now O
come O
to O
the O
point O
. O
Your O
mother O
insists O
upon O
your O
accepting O
it O
. O
Is O
it O
not O
so O
, O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
or O
I O
will O
never O
see O
her O
again O
. O
" O
" O
An O
unhappy O
alternative O
is O
before O
you O
, O
Elizabeth O
. O
From O
this O
day O
you O
must O
be O
a O
stranger O
to O
one O
of O
your O
parents O
. O
Your O
mother O
will O
never O
see O
you O
again O
if O
you O
do O
_not_ O
marry O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
and O
I O
will O
never O
see O
you O
again O
if O
you O
_do_ O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
but O
smile O
at O
such O
a O
conclusion O
of O
such O
a O
beginning O
; O
but O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
who O
had O
persuaded O
herself O
that O
her O
husband O
regarded O
the O
affair O
as O
she O
wished O
, O
was O
excessively O
disappointed O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
by O
talking O
in O
this O
way O
? O
You O
promised O
me O
to O
_insist_ O
upon O
her O
marrying O
him O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
" O
replied O
her O
husband O
, O
" O
I O
have O
two O
small O
favours O
to O
request O
. O
First O
, O
that O
you O
will O
allow O
me O
the O
free O
use O
of O
my O
understanding O
on O
the O
present O
occasion O
; O
and O
, O
secondly O
, O
of O
my O
room O
. O
I O
shall O
be O
glad O
to O
have O
the O
library O
to O
myself O
as O
soon O
as O
may O
be O
. O
" O
Not O
yet O
, O
however O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
disappointment O
in O
her O
husband O
, O
did O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
give O
up O
the O
point O
. O
She O
talked O
to O
Elizabeth O
again O
and O
again O
; O
coaxed O
and O
threatened O
her O
by O
turns O
. O
She O
endeavoured O
to O
secure O
Jane O
in O
her O
interest O
, O
but O
Jane O
, O
with O
all O
possible O
mildness O
, O
declined O
interfering O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
sometimes O
with O
real O
earnestness O
, O
and O
sometimes O
with O
playful O
gaiety O
, O
replied O
to O
her O
attacks O
. O
Though O
her O
manner O
varied O
, O
however O
, O
her O
determination O
never O
did O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
meanwhile O
, O
was O
meditating O
in O
solitude O
on O
what O
had O
passed O
. O
He O
thought O
too O
well O
of O
himself O
to O
comprehend O
on O
what O
motive O
his O
cousin O
could O
refuse O
him O
; O
and O
though O
his O
pride O
was O
hurt O
, O
he O
suffered O
in O
no O
other O
way O
. O
His O
regard O
for O
her O
was O
quite O
imaginary O
; O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
her O
deserving O
her O
mother O
's O
reproach O
prevented O
his O
feeling O
any O
regret O
. O
While O
the O
family O
were O
in O
this O
confusion O
, O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
came O
to O
spend O
the O
day O
with O
them O
. O
She O
was O
met O
in O
the O
vestibule O
by O
Lydia O
, O
who O
, O
flying O
to O
her O
, O
cried O
in O
a O
half O
whisper O
, O
" O
I O
am O
glad O
you O
are O
come O
, O
for O
there O
is O
such O
fun O
here O
! O
What O
do O
you O
think O
has O
happened O
this O
morning O
? O
Mr. O
Collins O
has O
made O
an O
offer O
to O
Lizzy O
, O
and O
she O
will O
not O
have O
him O
. O
" O
Charlotte O
had O
hardly O
time O
to O
answer O
before O
they O
were O
joined O
by O
Kitty O
, O
who O
came O
to O
tell O
the O
same O
news O
; O
and O
no O
sooner O
had O
they O
entered O
the O
breakfast-room O
, O
where O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
alone O
, O
than O
she O
likewise O
began O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
calling O
on O
Miss O
Lucas O
for O
her O
compassion O
, O
and O
entreating O
her O
to O
persuade O
her O
friend O
Lizzy O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
wishes O
of O
her O
family O
. O
" O
Pray O
do O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
in O
a O
melancholy O
tone O
; O
" O
for O
nobody O
is O
on O
my O
side O
, O
nobody O
takes O
part O
with O
me O
; O
I O
am O
cruelly O
used O
, O
nobody O
feels O
for O
my O
poor O
nerves O
. O
" O
Charlotte O
's O
reply O
was O
spared O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
Ay O
, O
there O
she O
comes O
, O
" O
continued O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
looking O
as O
unconcerned O
as O
may O
be O
, O
and O
caring O
no O
more O
for O
us O
than O
if O
we O
were O
at O
York O
, O
provided O
she O
can O
have O
her O
own O
way O
. O
But O
I O
tell O
you O
what O
, O
Miss O
Lizzy O
, O
if O
you O
take O
it O
into O
your O
head O
to O
go O
on O
refusing O
every O
offer O
of O
marriage O
in O
this O
way O
, O
you O
will O
never O
get O
a O
husband O
at O
all O
-- O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
do O
not O
know O
who O
is O
to O
maintain O
you O
when O
your O
father O
is O
dead O
. O
_I_ O
shall O
not O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
you O
-- O
and O
so O
I O
warn O
you O
. O
I O
have O
done O
with O
you O
from O
this O
very O
day O
. O
I O
told O
you O
in O
the O
library O
, O
you O
know O
, O
that O
I O
should O
never O
speak O
to O
you O
again O
, O
and O
you O
will O
find O
me O
as O
good O
as O
my O
word O
. O
I O
have O
no O
pleasure O
in O
talking O
to O
undutiful O
children O
. O
Not O
that O
I O
have O
much O
pleasure O
, O
indeed O
, O
in O
talking O
to O
anybody O
. O
People O
who O
suffer O
as O
I O
do O
from O
nervous O
complaints O
can O
have O
no O
great O
inclination O
for O
talking O
. O
Nobody O
can O
tell O
what O
I O
suffer O
! O
But O
it O
is O
always O
so O
. O
Those O
who O
do O
not O
complain O
are O
never O
pitied O
. O
" O
Her O
daughters O
listened O
in O
silence O
to O
this O
effusion O
, O
sensible O
that O
any O
attempt O
to O
reason O
with O
or O
soothe O
her O
would O
only O
increase O
the O
irritation O
. O
She O
talked O
on O
, O
therefore O
, O
without O
interruption O
from O
any O
of O
them O
till O
they O
were O
joined O
by O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
who O
entered O
with O
an O
air O
more O
stately O
than O
usual O
, O
and O
on O
perceiving O
whom O
, O
she O
said O
to O
the O
girls O
, O
-- O
" O
Now O
, O
I O
do O
insist O
upon O
it O
, O
that O
you O
, O
all O
of O
you O
, O
hold O
your O
tongues O
, O
and O
let O
Mr. O
Collins O
and O
me O
have O
a O
little O
conversation O
together O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
passed O
quietly O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
Jane O
and O
Kitty O
followed O
, O
but O
Lydia O
stood O
her O
ground O
, O
determined O
to O
hear O
all O
she O
could O
; O
and O
Charlotte O
, O
detained O
first O
by O
the O
civility O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
whose O
inquiries O
after O
herself O
and O
all O
her O
family O
were O
very O
minute O
, O
and O
then O
by O
a O
little O
curiosity O
, O
satisfied O
herself O
with O
walking O
to O
the O
window O
and O
pretending O
not O
to O
hear O
. O
In O
a O
doleful O
voice O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
thus O
began O
the O
projected O
conversation O
: O
-- O
" O
Oh O
, O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
! O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
madam O
, O
" O
replied O
he O
, O
" O
let O
us O
be O
for O
ever O
silent O
on O
this O
point O
. O
Far O
be O
it O
from O
me O
, O
" O
he O
presently O
continued O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
marked O
his O
displeasure O
, O
" O
to O
resent O
the O
behaviour O
of O
your O
daughter O
. O
Resignation O
to O
inevitable O
evils O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
us O
all O
: O
the O
peculiar O
duty O
of O
a O
young O
man O
who O
has O
been O
so O
fortunate O
as O
I O
have O
been O
, O
in O
early O
preferment O
; O
and O
, O
I O
trust O
, O
I O
am O
resigned O
. O
Perhaps O
not O
the O
less O
so O
from O
feeling O
a O
doubt O
of O
my O
positive O
happiness O
had O
my O
fair O
cousin O
honoured O
me O
with O
her O
hand O
; O
for O
I O
have O
often O
observed O
, O
that O
resignation O
is O
never O
so O
perfect O
as O
when O
the O
blessing O
denied O
begins O
to O
lose O
somewhat O
of O
its O
value O
in O
our O
estimation O
. O
You O
will O
not O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
consider O
me O
as O
showing O
any O
disrespect O
to O
your O
family O
, O
my O
dear O
madam O
, O
by O
thus O
withdrawing O
my O
pretensions O
to O
your O
daughter O
's O
favour O
, O
without O
having O
paid O
yourself O
and O
Mr. O
Bennet O
the O
compliment O
of O
requesting O
you O
to O
interpose O
your O
authority O
in O
my O
behalf O
. O
My O
conduct O
may O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
be O
objectionable O
in O
having O
accepted O
my O
dismission O
from O
your O
daughter O
's O
lips O
instead O
of O
your O
own O
; O
but O
we O
are O
all O
liable O
to O
error O
. O
I O
have O
certainly O
meant O
well O
through O
the O
whole O
affair O
. O
My O
object O
has O
been O
to O
secure O
an O
amiable O
companion O
for O
myself O
, O
with O
due O
consideration O
for O
the O
advantage O
of O
all O
your O
family O
; O
and O
if O
my O
_manner_ O
has O
been O
at O
all O
reprehensible O
, O
I O
here O
beg O
leave O
to O
apologize O
. O
