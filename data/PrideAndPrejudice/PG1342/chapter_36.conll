Elizabeth O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Darcy O
gave O
her O
the O
letter O
, O
did O
not O
expect O
it O
to O
contain O
a O
renewal O
of O
his O
offers O
, O
she O
had O
formed O
no O
expectation O
at O
all O
of O
its O
contents O
. O
But O
such O
as O
they O
were O
, O
it O
may O
be O
well O
supposed O
how O
eagerly O
she O
went O
through O
them O
, O
and O
what O
a O
contrariety O
of O
emotion O
they O
excited O
. O
Her O
feelings O
as O
she O
read O
were O
scarcely O
to O
be O
defined O
. O
With O
amazement O
did O
she O
first O
understand O
that O
he O
believed O
any O
apology O
to O
be O
in O
his O
power O
; O
and O
steadfastly O
was O
she O
persuaded O
, O
that O
he O
could O
have O
no O
explanation O
to O
give O
, O
which O
a O
just O
sense O
of O
shame O
would O
not O
conceal O
. O
With O
a O
strong O
prejudice O
against O
everything O
he O
might O
say O
, O
she O
began O
his O
account O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
at O
Netherfield O
. O
She O
read O
with O
an O
eagerness O
which O
hardly O
left O
her O
power O
of O
comprehension O
; O
and O
from O
impatience O
of O
knowing O
what O
the O
next O
sentence O
might O
bring O
, O
was O
incapable O
of O
attending O
to O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
one O
before O
her O
eyes O
. O
His O
belief O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
insensibility O
she O
instantly O
resolved O
to O
be O
false O
; O
and O
his O
account O
of O
the O
real O
, O
the O
worst O
objections O
to O
the O
match O
, O
made O
her O
too O
angry O
to O
have O
any O
wish O
of O
doing O
him O
justice O
. O
He O
expressed O
no O
regret O
for O
what O
he O
had O
done O
which O
satisfied O
her O
; O
his O
style O
was O
not O
penitent O
, O
but O
haughty O
. O
It O
was O
all O
pride O
and O
insolence O
. O
But O
when O
this O
subject O
was O
succeeded O
by O
his O
account O
of O
Mr. O
Wickham O
-- O
when O
she O
read O
, O
with O
somewhat O
clearer O
attention O
, O
a O
relation O
of O
events O
which O
, O
if O
true O
, O
must O
overthrow O
every O
cherished O
opinion O
of O
his O
worth O
, O
and O
which O
bore O
so O
alarming O
an O
affinity O
to O
his O
own O
history O
of O
himself O
-- O
her O
feelings O
were O
yet O
more O
acutely O
painful O
and O
more O
difficult O
of O
definition O
. O
Astonishment O
, O
apprehension O
, O
and O
even O
horror O
, O
oppressed O
her O
. O
She O
wished O
to O
discredit O
it O
entirely O
, O
repeatedly O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
This O
must O
be O
false O
! O
This O
can O
not O
be O
! O
This O
must O
be O
the O
grossest O
falsehood O
! O
" O
-- O
and O
when O
she O
had O
gone O
through O
the O
whole O
letter O
, O
though O
scarcely O
knowing O
anything O
of O
the O
last O
page O
or O
two O
, O
put O
it O
hastily O
away O
, O
protesting O
that O
she O
would O
not O
regard O
it O
, O
that O
she O
would O
never O
look O
in O
it O
again O
. O
In O
this O
perturbed O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
with O
thoughts O
that O
could O
rest O
on O
nothing O
, O
she O
walked O
on O
; O
but O
it O
would O
not O
do O
: O
in O
half O
a O
minute O
the O
letter O
was O
unfolded O
again O
; O
and O
collecting O
herself O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
, O
she O
again O
began O
the O
mortifying O
perusal O
of O
all O
that O
related O
to O
Wickham O
, O
and O
commanded O
herself O
so O
far O
as O
to O
examine O
the O
meaning O
of O
every O
sentence O
. O
The O
account O
of O
his O
connection O
with O
the O
Pemberley O
family O
was O
exactly O
what O
he O
had O
related O
himself O
; O
and O
the O
kindness O
of O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
though O
she O
had O
not O
before O
known O
its O
extent O
, O
agreed O
equally O
well O
with O
his O
own O
words O
. O
So O
far O
each O
recital O
confirmed O
the O
other O
; O
but O
when O
she O
came O
to O
the O
will O
, O
the O
difference O
was O
great O
. O
What O
Wickham O
had O
said O
of O
the O
living O
was O
fresh O
in O
her O
memory O
; O
and O
as O
she O
recalled O
his O
very O
words O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
feel O
that O
there O
was O
gross O
duplicity O
on O
one O
side O
or O
the O
other O
, O
and O
, O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
she O
flattered O
herself O
that O
her O
wishes O
did O
not O
err O
. O
But O
when O
she O
read O
and O
re-read O
, O
with O
the O
closest O
attention O
, O
the O
particulars O
immediately O
following O
of O
Wickham O
's O
resigning O
all O
pretensions O
to O
the O
living O
, O
of O
his O
receiving O
in O
lieu O
so O
considerable O
a O
sum O
as O
three O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
again O
was O
she O
forced O
to O
hesitate O
. O
She O
put O
down O
the O
letter O
, O
weighed O
every O
circumstance O
with O
what O
she O
meant O
to O
be O
impartiality O
-- O
deliberated O
on O
the O
probability O
of O
each O
statement O
-- O
but O
with O
little O
success O
. O
On O
both O
sides O
it O
was O
only O
assertion O
. O
Again O
she O
read O
on O
. O
But O
every O
line O
proved O
more O
clearly O
that O
the O
affair O
, O
which O
she O
had O
believed O
it O
impossible O
that O
any O
contrivance O
could O
so O
represent O
as O
to O
render O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
conduct O
in O
it O
less O
than O
infamous O
, O
was O
capable O
of O
a O
turn O
which O
must O
make O
him O
entirely O
blameless O
throughout O
the O
whole O
. O
The O
extravagance O
and O
general O
profligacy O
which O
he O
scrupled O
not O
to O
lay O
to O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
charge O
exceedingly O
shocked O
her O
; O
the O
more O
so O
, O
as O
she O
could O
bring O
no O
proof O
of O
its O
injustice O
. O
She O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
him O
before O
his O
entrance O
into O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
militia O
, O
in O
which O
he O
had O
engaged O
at O
the O
persuasion O
of O
the O
young O
man O
, O
who O
, O
on O
meeting O
him O
accidentally O
in O
town O
, O
had O
there O
renewed O
a O
slight O
acquaintance O
. O
Of O
his O
former O
way O
of O
life O
, O
nothing O
had O
been O
known O
in O
Hertfordshire O
but O
what O
he O
told O
himself O
. O
As O
to O
his O
real O
character O
, O
had O
information O
been O
in O
her O
power O
, O
she O
had O
never O
felt O
a O
wish O
of O
inquiring O
. O
His O
countenance O
, O
voice O
, O
and O
manner O
, O
had O
established O
him O
at O
once O
in O
the O
possession O
of O
every O
virtue O
. O
She O
tried O
to O
recollect O
some O
instance O
of O
goodness O
, O
some O
distinguished O
trait O
of O
integrity O
or O
benevolence O
, O
that O
might O
rescue O
him O
from O
the O
attacks O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
; O
or O
at O
least O
, O
by O
the O
predominance O
of O
virtue O
, O
atone O
for O
those O
casual O
errors O
, O
under O
which O
she O
would O
endeavour O
to O
class O
what O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
described O
as O
the O
idleness O
and O
vice O
of O
many O
years O
' O
continuance O
. O
But O
no O
such O
recollection O
befriended O
her O
. O
She O
could O
see O
him O
instantly O
before O
her O
, O
in O
every O
charm O
of O
air O
and O
address O
, O
but O
she O
could O
remember O
no O
more O
substantial O
good O
than O
the O
general O
approbation O
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
the O
regard O
which O
his O
social O
powers O
had O
gained O
him O
in O
the O
mess O
. O
After O
pausing O
on O
this O
point O
a O
considerable O
while O
, O
she O
once O
more O
continued O
to O
read O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
the O
story O
which O
followed O
, O
of O
his O
designs O
on O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
received O
some O
confirmation O
from O
what O
had O
passed O
between O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
and O
herself O
only O
the O
morning O
before O
; O
and O
at O
last O
she O
was O
referred O
for O
the O
truth O
of O
every O
particular O
to O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
himself O
-- O
from O
whom O
she O
had O
previously O
received O
the O
information O
of O
his O
near O
concern O
in O
all O
his O
cousin O
's O
affairs O
and O
whose O
character O
she O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
question O
. O
At O
one O
time O
she O
had O
almost O
resolved O
on O
applying O
to O
him O
, O
but O
the O
idea O
was O
checked O
by O
the O
awkwardness O
of O
the O
application O
, O
and O
at O
length O
wholly O
banished O
by O
the O
conviction O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
would O
never O
have O
hazarded O
such O
a O
proposal O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
been O
well O
assured O
of O
his O
cousin O
's O
corroboration O
. O
She O
perfectly O
remembered O
everything O
that O
had O
passed O
in O
conversation O
between O
Wickham O
and O
herself O
in O
their O
first O
evening O
at O
Mr. O
Philips O
's O
. O
Many O
of O
his O
expressions O
were O
still O
fresh O
in O
her O
memory O
. O
She O
was O
_now_ O
struck O
with O
the O
impropriety O
of O
such O
communications O
to O
a O
stranger O
, O
and O
wondered O
it O
had O
escaped O
her O
before O
. O
She O
saw O
the O
indelicacy O
of O
putting O
himself O
forward O
as O
he O
had O
done O
, O
and O
the O
inconsistency O
of O
his O
professions O
with O
his O
conduct O
. O
She O
remembered O
that O
he O
had O
boasted O
of O
having O
no O
fear O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
Darcy O
-- O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
might O
leave O
the O
country O
, O
but O
that O
_he_ O
should O
stand O
his O
ground O
; O
yet O
he O
had O
avoided O
the O
Netherfield O
ball O
the O
very O
next O
week O
. O
She O
remembered O
, O
also O
, O
that O
till O
the O
Netherfield O
family O
had O
quitted O
the O
country O
, O
he O
had O
told O
his O
story O
to O
no O
one O
but O
herself O
; O
but O
that O
after O
their O
removal O
, O
it O
had O
been O
everywhere O
discussed O
; O
that O
he O
had O
then O
no O
reserves O
, O
no O
scruples O
in O
sinking O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
character O
, O
though O
he O
had O
assured O
her O
that O
respect O
for O
the O
father O
would O
always O
prevent O
his O
exposing O
the O
son O
. O
How O
differently O
did O
everything O
now O
appear O
in O
which O
he O
was O
concerned O
! O
His O
attentions O
to O
Miss O
King O
were O
now O
the O
consequence O
of O
views O
solely O
and O
hatefully O
mercenary O
; O
and O
the O
mediocrity O
of O
her O
fortune O
proved O
no O
longer O
the O
moderation O
of O
his O
wishes O
, O
but O
his O
eagerness O
to O
grasp O
at O
anything O
. O
His O
behaviour O
to O
herself O
could O
now O
have O
had O
no O
tolerable O
motive O
: O
he O
had O
either O
been O
deceived O
with O
regard O
to O
her O
fortune O
, O
or O
had O
been O
gratifying O
his O
vanity O
by O
encouraging O
the O
preference O
which O
she O
believed O
she O
had O
most O
incautiously O
shown O
. O
Every O
lingering O
struggle O
in O
his O
favour O
grew O
fainter O
and O
fainter O
; O
and O
in O
further O
justification O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
she O
could O
not O
but O
allow O
that O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
when O
questioned O
by O
Jane O
, O
had O
long O
ago O
asserted O
his O
blamelessness O
in O
the O
affair O
; O
-- O
that O
, O
proud O
and O
repulsive O
as O
were O
his O
manners O
, O
she O
had O
never O
, O
in O
the O
whole O
course O
of O
their O
acquaintance O
-- O
an O
acquaintance O
which O
had O
latterly O
brought O
them O
much O
together O
, O
and O
given O
her O
a O
sort O
of O
intimacy O
with O
his O
ways O
-- O
seen O
anything O
that O
betrayed O
him O
to O
be O
unprincipled O
or O
unjust O
-- O
anything O
that O
spoke O
him O
of O
irreligious O
or O
immoral O
habits O
; O
-- O
that O
among O
his O
own O
connections O
he O
was O
esteemed O
and O
valued O
; O
-- O
that O
even O
Wickham O
had O
allowed O
him O
merit O
as O
a O
brother O
, O
and O
that O
she O
had O
often O
heard O
him O
speak O
so O
affectionately O
of O
his O
sister O
as O
to O
prove O
him O
capable O
of O
some O
amiable O
feeling O
; O
-- O
that O
had O
his O
actions O
been O
what O
Wickham O
represented O
them O
, O
so O
gross O
a O
violation O
of O
everything O
right O
could O
hardly O
have O
been O
concealed O
from O
the O
world O
; O
and O
that O
friendship O
between O
a O
person O
capable O
of O
it O
and O
such O
an O
amiable O
man O
as O
Mr. O
Bingley O
was O
incomprehensible O
. O
She O
grew O
absolutely O
ashamed O
of O
herself O
. O
Of O
neither O
Darcy O
nor O
Wickham O
could O
she O
think O
, O
without O
feeling O
that O
she O
had O
been O
blind O
, O
partial O
, O
prejudiced O
, O
absurd O
. O
" O
How O
despicably O
have O
I O
acted O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
I O
, O
who O
have O
prided O
myself O
on O
my O
discernment O
! O
I O
, O
who O
have O
valued O
myself O
on O
my O
abilities O
! O
who O
have O
often O
disdained O
the O
generous O
candour O
of O
my O
sister O
, O
and O
gratified O
my O
vanity O
in O
useless O
or O
blameless O
distrust O
. O
How O
humiliating O
is O
this O
discovery O
! O
Yet O
, O
how O
just O
a O
humiliation O
! O
Had O
I O
been O
in O
love O
, O
I O
could O
not O
have O
been O
more O
wretchedly O
blind O
. O
But O
vanity O
, O
not O
love O
, O
has O
been O
my O
folly O
. O
Pleased O
with O
the O
preference O
of O
one O
, O
and O
offended O
by O
the O
neglect O
of O
the O
other O
, O
on O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
I O
have O
courted O
prepossession O
and O
ignorance O
, O
and O
driven O
reason O
away O
where O
either O
were O
concerned O
. O
Till O
this O
moment O
, O
I O
never O
knew O
myself O
. O
" O
From O
herself O
to O
Jane O
, O
from O
Jane O
to O
Bingley O
, O
her O
thoughts O
were O
in O
a O
line O
which O
soon O
brought O
to O
her O
recollection O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
explanation O
_there_ O
had O
appeared O
very O
insufficient O
; O
and O
she O
read O
it O
again O
. O
Widely O
different O
was O
the O
effect O
of O
a O
second O
perusal O
. O
How O
could O
she O
deny O
that O
credit O
to O
his O
assertions O
, O
in O
one O
instance O
, O
which O
she O
had O
been O
obliged O
to O
give O
in O
the O
other O
? O
He O
declared O
himself O
to O
have O
been O
totally O
unsuspicious O
of O
her O
sister O
's O
attachment O
; O
and O
she O
could O
not O
help O
remembering O
what O
Charlotte O
's O
opinion O
had O
always O
been O
. O
Neither O
could O
she O
deny O
the O
justice O
of O
his O
description O
of O
Jane O
. O
She O
felt O
that O
Jane O
's O
feelings O
, O
though O
fervent O
, O
were O
little O
displayed O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
a O
constant O
complacency O
in O
her O
air O
and O
manner O
, O
not O
often O
united O
with O
great O
sensibility O
. O
When O
she O
came O
to O
that O
part O
of O
the O
letter O
in O
which O
her O
family O
were O
mentioned O
, O
in O
tones O
of O
such O
mortifying O
, O
yet O
merited O
, O
reproach O
, O
her O
sense O
of O
shame O
was O
severe O
. O
The O
justice O
of O
the O
charge O
struck O
her O
too O
forcibly O
for O
denial O
; O
and O
the O
circumstances O
to O
which O
he O
particularly O
alluded O
, O
as O
having O
passed O
at O
the O
Netherfield O
ball O
, O
and O
as O
confirming O
all O
his O
first O
disapprobation O
, O
could O
not O
have O
made O
a O
stronger O
impression O
on O
his O
mind O
than O
on O
hers O
. O
The O
compliment O
to O
herself O
and O
her O
sister O
was O
not O
unfelt O
. O
It O
soothed O
, O
but O
it O
could O
not O
console O
her O
for O
the O
contempt O
which O
had O
been O
thus O
self-attracted O
by O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
family O
; O
and O
as O
she O
considered O
that O
Jane O
's O
disappointment O
had O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
been O
the O
work O
of O
her O
nearest O
relations O
, O
and O
reflected O
how O
materially O
the O
credit O
of O
both O
must O
be O
hurt O
by O
such O
impropriety O
of O
conduct O
, O
she O
felt O
depressed O
beyond O
anything O
she O
had O
ever O
known O
before O
. O
After O
wandering O
along O
the O
lane O
for O
two O
hours O
, O
giving O
way O
to O
every O
variety O
of O
thought O
, O
reconsidering O
events O
, O
determining O
probabilities O
, O
and O
reconciling O
herself O
, O
as O
well O
as O
she O
could O
, O
to O
a O
change O
so O
sudden O
and O
so O
important O
, O
fatigue O
, O
and O
a O
recollection O
of O
her O
long O
absence O
, O
made O
her O
at O
length O
return O
home O
; O
and O
she O
entered O
the O
house O
with O
the O
wish O
of O
appearing O
cheerful O
as O
usual O
, O
and O
the O
resolution O
of O
repressing O
such O
reflections O
as O
must O
make O
her O
unfit O
for O
conversation O
. O
She O
was O
immediately O
told O
, O
that O
the O
two O
gentlemen O
from O
Rosings O
had O
each O
called O
during O
her O
absence O
; O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
only O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
to O
take O
leave O
, O
but O
that O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
had O
been O
sitting O
with O
them O
at O
least O
an O
hour O
, O
hoping O
for O
her O
return O
, O
and O
almost O
resolving O
to O
walk O
after O
her O
till O
she O
could O
be O
found O
. O
Elizabeth O
could O
but O
just O
_affect_ O
concern O
in O
missing O
him O
; O
she O
really O
rejoiced O
at O
it O
. O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
was O
no O
longer O
an O
object O
. O
She O
could O
think O
only O
of O
her O
letter O
. O
