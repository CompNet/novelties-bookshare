Sir O
William O
stayed O
only O
a O
week O
at O
Hunsford O
; O
but O
his O
visit O
was O
long O
enough O
to O
convince O
him O
of O
his O
daughter O
's O
being O
most O
comfortably O
settled O
, O
and O
of O
her O
possessing O
such O
a O
husband O
and O
such O
a O
neighbour O
as O
were O
not O
often O
met O
with O
. O
While O
Sir O
William O
was O
with O
them O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
devoted O
his O
mornings O
to O
driving O
him O
out O
in O
his O
gig O
, O
and O
showing O
him O
the O
country O
: O
but O
when O
he O
went O
away O
, O
the O
whole O
family O
returned O
to O
their O
usual O
employments O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
thankful O
to O
find O
that O
they O
did O
not O
see O
more O
of O
her O
cousin O
by O
the O
alteration O
; O
for O
the O
chief O
of O
the O
time O
between O
breakfast O
and O
dinner O
was O
now O
passed O
by O
him O
either O
at O
work O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
or O
in O
reading O
and O
writing O
, O
and O
looking O
out O
of O
window O
in O
his O
own O
book O
room O
, O
which O
fronted O
the O
road O
. O
The O
room O
in O
which O
the O
ladies O
sat O
was O
backwards O
. O
Elizabeth O
at O
first O
had O
rather O
wondered O
that O
Charlotte O
should O
not O
prefer O
the O
dining O
parlour O
for O
common O
use O
; O
it O
was O
a O
better O
sized O
room O
, O
and O
had O
a O
pleasanter O
aspect O
: O
but O
she O
soon O
saw O
that O
her O
friend O
had O
an O
excellent O
reason O
for O
what O
she O
did O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Collins O
would O
undoubtedly O
have O
been O
much O
less O
in O
his O
own O
apartment O
had O
they O
sat O
in O
one O
equally O
lively O
; O
and O
she O
gave O
Charlotte O
credit O
for O
the O
arrangement O
. O
From O
the O
drawing-room O
they O
could O
distinguish O
nothing O
in O
the O
lane O
, O
and O
were O
indebted O
to O
Mr. O
Collins O
for O
the O
knowledge O
of O
what O
carriages O
went O
along O
, O
and O
how O
often O
especially O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
drove O
by O
in O
her O
phaeton O
, O
which O
he O
never O
failed O
coming O
to O
inform O
them O
of O
, O
though O
it O
happened O
almost O
every O
day O
. O
She O
not O
unfrequently O
stopped O
at O
the O
Parsonage O
, O
and O
had O
a O
few O
minutes O
' O
conversation O
with O
Charlotte O
, O
but O
was O
scarcely O
ever O
prevailed O
on O
to O
get O
out O
. O
Very O
few O
days O
passed O
in O
which O
Mr. O
Collins O
did O
not O
walk O
to O
Rosings O
, O
and O
not O
many O
in O
which O
his O
wife O
did O
not O
think O
it O
necessary O
to O
go O
likewise O
; O
and O
till O
Elizabeth O
recollected O
that O
there O
might O
be O
other O
family O
livings O
to O
be O
disposed O
of O
, O
she O
could O
not O
understand O
the O
sacrifice O
of O
so O
many O
hours O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
they O
were O
honoured O
with O
a O
call O
from O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
and O
nothing O
escaped O
her O
observation O
that O
was O
passing O
in O
the O
room O
during O
these O
visits O
. O
She O
examined O
into O
their O
employments O
, O
looked O
at O
their O
work O
, O
and O
advised O
them O
to O
do O
it O
differently O
; O
found O
fault O
with O
the O
arrangement O
of O
the O
furniture O
, O
or O
detected O
the O
housemaid O
in O
negligence O
; O
and O
if O
she O
accepted O
any O
refreshment O
, O
seemed O
to O
do O
it O
only O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
finding O
out O
that O
Mrs. O
Collins O
's O
joints O
of O
meat O
were O
too O
large O
for O
her O
family O
. O
Elizabeth O
soon O
perceived O
, O
that O
though O
this O
great O
lady O
was O
not O
in O
the O
commission O
of O
the O
peace O
for O
the O
county O
, O
she O
was O
a O
most O
active O
magistrate O
in O
her O
own O
parish O
, O
the O
minutest O
concerns O
of O
which O
were O
carried O
to O
her O
by O
Mr. O
Collins O
; O
and O
whenever O
any O
of O
the O
cottagers O
were O
disposed O
to O
be O
quarrelsome O
, O
discontented O
, O
or O
too O
poor O
, O
she O
sallied O
forth O
into O
the O
village O
to O
settle O
their O
differences O
, O
silence O
their O
complaints O
, O
and O
scold O
them O
into O
harmony O
and O
plenty O
. O
The O
entertainment O
of O
dining O
at O
Rosings O
was O
repeated O
about O
twice O
a O
week O
; O
and O
, O
allowing O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
Sir O
William O
, O
and O
there O
being O
only O
one O
card-table O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
every O
such O
entertainment O
was O
the O
counterpart O
of O
the O
first O
. O
Their O
other O
engagements O
were O
few O
, O
as O
the O
style O
of O
living O
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
in O
general O
was O
beyond O
the O
Collinses O
' O
reach O
. O
This O
, O
however O
, O
was O
no O
evil O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
upon O
the O
whole O
she O
spent O
her O
time O
comfortably O
enough O
: O
there O
were O
half O
hours O
of O
pleasant O
conversation O
with O
Charlotte O
, O
and O
the O
weather O
was O
so O
fine O
for O
the O
time O
of O
year O
, O
that O
she O
had O
often O
great O
enjoyment O
out O
of O
doors O
. O
Her O
favourite O
walk O
, O
and O
where O
she O
frequently O
went O
while O
the O
others O
were O
calling O
on O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
was O
along O
the O
open O
grove O
which O
edged O
that O
side O
of O
the O
park O
, O
where O
there O
was O
a O
nice O
sheltered O
path O
, O
which O
no O
one O
seemed O
to O
value O
but O
herself O
, O
and O
where O
she O
felt O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
curiosity O
. O
In O
this O
quiet O
way O
the O
first O
fortnight O
of O
her O
visit O
soon O
passed O
away O
. O
Easter O
was O
approaching O
, O
and O
the O
week O
preceding O
it O
was O
to O
bring O
an O
addition O
to O
the O
family O
at O
Rosings O
, O
which O
in O
so O
small O
a O
circle O
must O
be O
important O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
heard O
, O
soon O
after O
her O
arrival O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
expected O
there O
in O
the O
course O
of O
a O
few O
weeks O
; O
and O
though O
there O
were O
not O
many O
of O
her O
acquaintance O
whom O
she O
did O
not O
prefer O
, O
his O
coming O
would O
furnish O
one O
comparatively O
new O
to O
look O
at O
in O
their O
Rosings O
parties O
, O
and O
she O
might O
be O
amused O
in O
seeing O
how O
hopeless O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
designs O
on O
him O
were O
, O
by O
his O
behaviour O
to O
his O
cousin O
, O
for O
whom O
he O
was O
evidently O
destined O
by O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
who O
talked O
of O
his O
coming O
with O
the O
greatest O
satisfaction O
, O
spoke O
of O
him O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
highest O
admiration O
, O
and O
seemed O
almost O
angry O
to O
find O
that O
he O
had O
already O
been O
frequently O
seen O
by O
Miss O
Lucas O
and O
herself O
. O
His O
arrival O
was O
soon O
known O
at O
the O
Parsonage O
; O
for O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
walking O
the O
whole O
morning O
within O
view O
of O
the O
lodges O
opening O
into O
Hunsford O
Lane O
, O
in O
order O
to O
have O
the O
earliest O
assurance O
of O
it O
; O
and O
, O
after O
making O
his O
bow O
as O
the O
carriage O
turned O
into O
the O
park O
, O
hurried O
home O
with O
the O
great O
intelligence O
. O
On O
the O
following O
morning O
he O
hastened O
to O
Rosings O
to O
pay O
his O
respects O
. O
There O
were O
two O
nephews O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
to O
require O
them O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
brought O
with O
him O
a O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
the O
younger O
son O
of O
his O
uncle O
, O
Lord O
-- O
-- O
; O
and O
, O
to O
the O
great O
surprise O
of O
all O
the O
party O
, O
when O
Mr. O
Collins O
returned O
, O
the O
gentlemen O
accompanied O
him O
. O
Charlotte O
had O
seen O
them O
from O
her O
husband O
's O
room O
, O
crossing O
the O
road O
, O
and O
immediately O
running O
into O
the O
other O
, O
told O
the O
girls O
what O
an O
honour O
they O
might O
expect O
, O
adding O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
may O
thank O
you O
, O
Eliza O
, O
for O
this O
piece O
of O
civility O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
would O
never O
have O
come O
so O
soon O
to O
wait O
upon O
me O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
had O
scarcely O
time O
to O
disclaim O
all O
right O
to O
the O
compliment O
before O
their O
approach O
was O
announced O
by O
the O
door-bell O
, O
and O
shortly O
afterwards O
the O
three O
gentlemen O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
who O
led O
the O
way O
, O
was O
about O
thirty O
, O
not O
handsome O
, O
but O
in O
person O
and O
address O
most O
truly O
the O
gentleman O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
looked O
just O
as O
he O
had O
been O
used O
to O
look O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
paid O
his O
compliments O
, O
with O
his O
usual O
reserve O
, O
to O
Mrs. O
Collins O
; O
and O
whatever O
might O
be O
his O
feelings O
towards O
her O
friend O
, O
met O
her O
with O
every O
appearance O
of O
composure O
. O
Elizabeth O
merely O
courtesied O
to O
him O
, O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
. O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
entered O
into O
conversation O
directly O
, O
with O
the O
readiness O
and O
ease O
of O
a O
well-bred O
man O
, O
and O
talked O
very O
pleasantly O
; O
but O
his O
cousin O
, O
after O
having O
addressed O
a O
slight O
observation O
on O
the O
house O
and O
garden O
to O
Mrs. O
Collins O
, O
sat O
for O
some O
time O
without O
speaking O
to O
anybody O
. O
At O
length O
, O
however O
, O
his O
civility O
was O
so O
far O
awakened O
as O
to O
inquire O
of O
Elizabeth O
after O
the O
health O
of O
her O
family O
. O
She O
answered O
him O
in O
the O
usual O
way O
; O
and O
, O
after O
a O
moment O
's O
pause O
, O
added O
, O
-- O
" O
My O
eldest O
sister O
has O
been O
in O
town O
these O
three O
months O
. O
Have O
you O
never O
happened O
to O
see O
her O
there O
? O
" O
She O
was O
perfectly O
sensible O
that O
he O
never O
had O
: O
but O
she O
wished O
to O
see O
whether O
he O
would O
betray O
any O
consciousness O
of O
what O
had O
passed O
between O
the O
Bingleys O
and O
Jane O
; O
and O
she O
thought O
he O
looked O
a O
little O
confused O
as O
he O
answered O
that O
he O
had O
never O
been O
so O
fortunate O
as O
to O
meet O
Miss O
Bennet O
. O
The O
subject O
was O
pursued O
no O
further O
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
soon O
afterwards O
went O
away O
. O
