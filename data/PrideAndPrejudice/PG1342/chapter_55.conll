A O
few O
days O
after O
this O
visit O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
called O
again O
, O
and O
alone O
. O
His O
friend O
had O
left O
him O
that O
morning O
for O
London O
, O
but O
was O
to O
return O
home O
in O
ten O
days O
' O
time O
. O
He O
sat O
with O
them O
above O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
was O
in O
remarkably O
good O
spirits O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
invited O
him O
to O
dine O
with O
them O
; O
but O
, O
with O
many O
expressions O
of O
concern O
, O
he O
confessed O
himself O
engaged O
elsewhere O
. O
" O
Next O
time O
you O
call O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
hope O
we O
shall O
be O
more O
lucky O
. O
" O
He O
should O
be O
particularly O
happy O
at O
any O
time O
, O
etc. O
, O
etc O
. O
; O
and O
if O
she O
would O
give O
him O
leave O
, O
would O
take O
an O
early O
opportunity O
of O
waiting O
on O
them O
. O
" O
Can O
you O
come O
to-morrow O
? O
" O
Yes O
, O
he O
had O
no O
engagement O
at O
all O
for O
to-morrow O
; O
and O
her O
invitation O
was O
accepted O
with O
alacrity O
. O
He O
came O
, O
and O
in O
such O
very O
good O
time O
, O
that O
the O
ladies O
were O
none O
of O
them O
dressed O
. O
In O
ran O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
to O
her O
daughters O
' O
room O
, O
in O
her O
dressing-gown O
, O
and O
with O
her O
hair O
half O
finished O
, O
crying O
out O
, O
-- O
" O
My O
dear O
Jane O
, O
make O
haste O
and O
hurry O
down O
. O
He O
is O
come O
-- O
Mr. O
Bingley O
is O
come O
. O
He O
is O
, O
indeed O
. O
Make O
haste O
, O
make O
haste O
. O
Here O
, O
Sarah O
, O
come O
to O
Miss O
Bennet O
this O
moment O
, O
and O
help O
her O
on O
with O
her O
gown O
. O
Never O
mind O
Miss O
Lizzy O
's O
hair O
. O
" O
" O
We O
will O
be O
down O
as O
soon O
as O
we O
can O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
; O
" O
but O
I O
dare O
say O
Kitty O
is O
forwarder O
than O
either O
of O
us O
, O
for O
she O
went O
upstairs O
half O
an O
hour O
ago O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
hang O
Kitty O
! O
what O
has O
she O
to O
do O
with O
it O
? O
Come O
, O
be O
quick O
, O
be O
quick O
! O
where O
is O
your O
sash O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
" O
But O
when O
her O
mother O
was O
gone O
, O
Jane O
would O
not O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
go O
down O
without O
one O
of O
her O
sisters O
. O
The O
same O
anxiety O
to O
get O
them O
by O
themselves O
was O
visible O
again O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
After O
tea O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
retired O
to O
the O
library O
, O
as O
was O
his O
custom O
, O
and O
Mary O
went O
upstairs O
to O
her O
instrument O
. O
Two O
obstacles O
of O
the O
five O
being O
thus O
removed O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
sat O
looking O
and O
winking O
at O
Elizabeth O
and O
Catherine O
for O
a O
considerable O
time O
, O
without O
making O
any O
impression O
on O
them O
. O
Elizabeth O
would O
not O
observe O
her O
; O
and O
when O
at O
last O
Kitty O
did O
, O
she O
very O
innocently O
said O
, O
" O
What O
is O
the O
matter O
, O
mamma O
? O
What O
do O
you O
keep O
winking O
at O
me O
for O
? O
What O
am O
I O
to O
do O
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
, O
child O
, O
nothing O
. O
I O
did O
not O
wink O
at O
you O
. O
" O
She O
then O
sat O
still O
five O
minutes O
longer O
; O
but O
unable O
to O
waste O
such O
a O
precious O
occasion O
, O
she O
suddenly O
got O
up O
, O
and O
saying O
to O
Kitty O
, O
-- O
" O
Come O
here O
, O
my O
love O
, O
I O
want O
to O
speak O
to O
you O
, O
" O
took O
her O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Jane O
instantly O
gave O
a O
look O
at O
Elizabeth O
which O
spoke O
her O
distress O
at O
such O
premeditation O
, O
and O
her O
entreaty O
that O
_she_ O
would O
not O
give O
in O
to O
it O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
half O
opened O
the O
door O
and O
called O
out O
, O
-- O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
I O
want O
to O
speak O
with O
you O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
. O
" O
We O
may O
as O
well O
leave O
them O
by O
themselves O
, O
you O
know O
, O
" O
said O
her O
mother O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
was O
in O
the O
hall O
. O
" O
Kitty O
and O
I O
are O
going O
upstairs O
to O
sit O
in O
my O
dressing-room O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
made O
no O
attempt O
to O
reason O
with O
her O
mother O
, O
but O
remained O
quietly O
in O
the O
hall O
till O
she O
and O
Kitty O
were O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
then O
returned O
into O
the O
drawing-room O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
schemes O
for O
this O
day O
were O
ineffectual O
. O
Bingley O
was O
everything O
that O
was O
charming O
, O
except O
the O
professed O
lover O
of O
her O
daughter O
. O
His O
ease O
and O
cheerfulness O
rendered O
him O
a O
most O
agreeable O
addition O
to O
their O
evening O
party O
; O
and O
he O
bore O
with O
the O
ill-judged O
officiousness O
of O
the O
mother O
, O
and O
heard O
all O
her O
silly O
remarks O
with O
a O
forbearance O
and O
command O
of O
countenance O
particularly O
grateful O
to O
the O
daughter O
. O
He O
scarcely O
needed O
an O
invitation O
to O
stay O
supper O
; O
and O
before O
he O
went O
away O
an O
engagement O
was O
formed O
, O
chiefly O
through O
his O
own O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
means O
, O
for O
his O
coming O
next O
morning O
to O
shoot O
with O
her O
husband O
. O
After O
this O
day O
, O
Jane O
said O
no O
more O
of O
her O
indifference O
. O
Not O
a O
word O
passed O
between O
the O
sisters O
concerning O
Bingley O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
went O
to O
bed O
in O
the O
happy O
belief O
that O
all O
must O
speedily O
be O
concluded O
, O
unless O
Mr. O
Darcy O
returned O
within O
the O
stated O
time O
. O
Seriously O
, O
however O
, O
she O
felt O
tolerably O
persuaded O
that O
all O
this O
must O
have O
taken O
place O
with O
that O
gentleman O
's O
concurrence O
. O
Bingley O
was O
punctual O
to O
his O
appointment O
; O
and O
he O
and O
Mr. O
Bennet O
spent O
the O
morning O
together O
, O
as O
had O
been O
agreed O
on O
. O
The O
latter O
was O
much O
more O
agreeable O
than O
his O
companion O
expected O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
of O
presumption O
or O
folly O
in O
Bingley O
that O
could O
provoke O
his O
ridicule O
, O
or O
disgust O
him O
into O
silence O
; O
and O
he O
was O
more O
communicative O
, O
and O
less O
eccentric O
, O
than O
the O
other O
had O
ever O
seen O
him O
. O
Bingley O
of O
course O
returned O
with O
him O
to O
dinner O
; O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
invention O
was O
again O
at O
work O
to O
get O
everybody O
away O
from O
him O
and O
her O
daughter O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
had O
a O
letter O
to O
write O
, O
went O
into O
the O
breakfast-room O
for O
that O
purpose O
soon O
after O
tea O
; O
for O
as O
the O
others O
were O
all O
going O
to O
sit O
down O
to O
cards O
, O
she O
could O
not O
be O
wanted O
to O
counteract O
her O
mother O
's O
schemes O
. O
But O
on O
her O
returning O
to O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
when O
her O
letter O
was O
finished O
, O
she O
saw O
, O
to O
her O
infinite O
surprise O
, O
there O
was O
reason O
to O
fear O
that O
her O
mother O
had O
been O
too O
ingenious O
for O
her O
. O
On O
opening O
the O
door O
, O
she O
perceived O
her O
sister O
and O
Bingley O
standing O
together O
over O
the O
hearth O
, O
as O
if O
engaged O
in O
earnest O
conversation O
; O
and O
had O
this O
led O
to O
no O
suspicion O
, O
the O
faces O
of O
both O
, O
as O
they O
hastily O
turned O
round O
and O
moved O
away O
from O
each O
other O
, O
would O
have O
told O
it O
all O
. O
_Their_ O
situation O
was O
awkward O
enough O
; O
but O
_hers_ O
she O
thought O
was O
still O
worse O
. O
Not O
a O
syllable O
was O
uttered O
by O
either O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
going O
away O
again O
, O
when O
Bingley O
, O
who O
as O
well O
as O
the O
other O
had O
sat O
down O
, O
suddenly O
rose O
, O
and O
, O
whispering O
a O
few O
words O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
Jane O
could O
have O
no O
reserves O
from O
Elizabeth O
, O
where O
confidence O
would O
give O
pleasure O
; O
and O
, O
instantly O
embracing O
her O
, O
acknowledged O
, O
with O
the O
liveliest O
emotion O
, O
that O
she O
was O
the O
happiest O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
. O
" O
'T O
is O
too O
much O
! O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
by O
far O
too O
much O
. O
I O
do O
not O
deserve O
it O
. O
Oh O
, O
why O
is O
not O
everybody O
as O
happy O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
's O
congratulations O
were O
given O
with O
a O
sincerity O
, O
a O
warmth O
, O
a O
delight O
, O
which O
words O
could O
but O
poorly O
express O
. O
Every O
sentence O
of O
kindness O
was O
a O
fresh O
source O
of O
happiness O
to O
Jane O
. O
But O
she O
would O
not O
allow O
herself O
to O
stay O
with O
her O
sister O
, O
or O
say O
half O
that O
remained O
to O
be O
said O
, O
for O
the O
present O
. O
" O
I O
must O
go O
instantly O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
I O
would O
not O
on O
any O
account O
trifle O
with O
her O
affectionate O
solicitude O
, O
or O
allow O
her O
to O
hear O
it O
from O
anyone O
but O
myself O
. O
He O
is O
gone O
to O
my O
father O
already O
. O
Oh O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
to O
know O
that O
what O
I O
have O
to O
relate O
will O
give O
such O
pleasure O
to O
all O
my O
dear O
family O
! O
how O
shall O
I O
bear O
so O
much O
happiness O
? O
" O
She O
then O
hastened O
away O
to O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
had O
purposely O
broken O
up O
the O
card-party O
, O
and O
was O
sitting O
upstairs O
with O
Kitty O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
was O
left O
by O
herself O
, O
now O
smiled O
at O
the O
rapidity O
and O
ease O
with O
which O
an O
affair O
was O
finally O
settled O
, O
that O
had O
given O
them O
so O
many O
previous O
months O
of O
suspense O
and O
vexation O
. O
" O
And O
this O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
is O
the O
end O
of O
all O
his O
friend O
's O
anxious O
circumspection O
! O
of O
all O
his O
sister O
's O
falsehood O
and O
contrivance O
! O
the O
happiest O
, O
wisest O
, O
and O
most O
reasonable O
end O
! O
" O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
she O
was O
joined O
by O
Bingley O
, O
whose O
conference O
with O
her O
father O
had O
been O
short O
and O
to O
the O
purpose O
. O
" O
Where O
is O
your O
sister O
? O
" O
said O
he O
hastily O
, O
as O
he O
opened O
the O
door O
. O
" O
With O
my O
mother O
upstairs O
. O
She O
will O
be O
down O
in O
a O
moment O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
. O
" O
He O
then O
shut O
the O
door O
, O
and O
, O
coming O
up O
to O
her O
, O
claimed O
the O
good O
wishes O
and O
affection O
of O
a O
sister O
. O
Elizabeth O
honestly O
and O
heartily O
expressed O
her O
delight O
in O
the O
prospect O
of O
their O
relationship O
. O
They O
shook O
hands O
with O
great O
cordiality O
; O
and O
then O
, O
till O
her O
sister O
came O
down O
, O
she O
had O
to O
listen O
to O
all O
he O
had O
to O
say O
of O
his O
own O
happiness O
, O
and O
of O
Jane O
's O
perfections O
; O
and O
in O
spite O
of O
his O
being O
a O
lover O
, O
Elizabeth O
really O
believed O
all O
his O
expectations O
of O
felicity O
to O
be O
rationally O
founded O
, O
because O
they O
had O
for O
basis O
the O
excellent O
understanding O
and O
super-excellent O
disposition O
of O
Jane O
, O
and O
a O
general O
similarity O
of O
feeling O
and O
taste O
between O
her O
and O
himself O
. O
It O
was O
an O
evening O
of O
no O
common O
delight O
to O
them O
all O
; O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
Miss O
Bennet O
's O
mind O
gave O
such O
a O
glow O
of O
sweet O
animation O
to O
her O
face O
, O
as O
made O
her O
look O
handsomer O
than O
ever O
. O
Kitty O
simpered O
and O
smiled O
, O
and O
hoped O
her O
turn O
was O
coming O
soon O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
could O
not O
give O
her O
consent O
, O
or O
speak O
her O
approbation O
in O
terms O
warm O
enough O
to O
satisfy O
her O
feelings O
, O
though O
she O
talked O
to O
Bingley O
of O
nothing O
else O
, O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
; O
and O
when O
Mr. O
Bennet O
joined O
them O
at O
supper O
, O
his O
voice O
and O
manner O
plainly O
showed O
how O
really O
happy O
he O
was O
. O
Not O
a O
word O
, O
however O
, O
passed O
his O
lips O
in O
allusion O
to O
it O
, O
till O
their O
visitor O
took O
his O
leave O
for O
the O
night O
; O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
gone O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
his O
daughter O
and O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
Jane O
, O
I O
congratulate O
you O
. O
You O
will O
be O
a O
very O
happy O
woman O
. O
" O
Jane O
went O
to O
him O
instantly O
, O
kissed O
him O
, O
and O
thanked O
him O
for O
his O
goodness O
. O
" O
You O
are O
a O
good O
girl O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
and O
I O
have O
great O
pleasure O
in O
thinking O
you O
will O
be O
so O
happily O
settled O
. O
I O
have O
not O
a O
doubt O
of O
your O
doing O
very O
well O
together O
. O
Your O
tempers O
are O
by O
no O
means O
unlike O
. O
You O
are O
each O
of O
you O
so O
complying O
, O
that O
nothing O
will O
ever O
be O
resolved O
on O
; O
so O
easy O
, O
that O
every O
servant O
will O
cheat O
you O
; O
and O
so O
generous O
, O
that O
you O
will O
always O
exceed O
your O
income O
. O
" O
" O
I O
hope O
not O
so O
. O
Imprudence O
or O
thoughtlessness O
in O
money O
matters O
would O
be O
unpardonable O
in O
_me_ O
. O
" O
" O
Exceed O
their O
income O
! O
My O
dear O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
cried O
his O
wife O
, O
" O
what O
are O
you O
talking O
of O
? O
Why O
, O
he O
has O
four O
or O
five O
thousand O
a O
year O
, O
and O
very O
likely O
more O
. O
" O
Then O
addressing O
her O
daughter O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
dear O
Jane O
, O
I O
am O
so O
happy O
! O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
sha O
n't O
get O
a O
wink O
of O
sleep O
all O
night O
. O
I O
knew O
how O
it O
would O
be O
. O
I O
always O
said O
it O
must O
be O
so O
, O
at O
last O
. O
I O
was O
sure O
you O
could O
not O
be O
so O
beautiful O
for O
nothing O
! O
I O
remember O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
ever O
I O
saw O
him O
, O
when O
he O
first O
came O
into O
Hertfordshire O
last O
year O
, O
I O
thought O
how O
likely O
it O
was O
that O
you O
should O
come O
together O
. O
Oh O
, O
he O
is O
the O
handsomest O
young O
man O
that O
ever O
was O
seen O
! O
" O
Wickham O
, O
Lydia O
, O
were O
all O
forgotten O
. O
Jane O
was O
beyond O
competition O
her O
favourite O
child O
. O
At O
that O
moment O
she O
cared O
for O
no O
other O
. O
Her O
younger O
sisters O
soon O
began O
to O
make O
interest O
with O
her O
for O
objects O
of O
happiness O
which O
she O
might O
in O
future O
be O
able O
to O
dispense O
. O
Mary O
petitioned O
for O
the O
use O
of O
the O
library O
at O
Netherfield O
; O
and O
Kitty O
begged O
very O
hard O
for O
a O
few O
balls O
there O
every O
winter O
. O
Bingley O
, O
from O
this O
time O
, O
was O
of O
course O
a O
daily O
visitor O
at O
Longbourn O
; O
coming O
frequently O
before O
breakfast O
, O
and O
always O
remaining O
till O
after O
supper O
; O
unless O
when O
some O
barbarous O
neighbour O
, O
who O
could O
not O
be O
enough O
detested O
, O
had O
given O
him O
an O
invitation O
to O
dinner O
, O
which O
he O
thought O
himself O
obliged O
to O
accept O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
now O
but O
little O
time O
for O
conversation O
with O
her O
sister O
; O
for O
while O
he O
was O
present O
Jane O
had O
no O
attention O
to O
bestow O
on O
anyone O
else O
: O
but O
she O
found O
herself O
considerably O
useful O
to O
both O
of O
them O
, O
in O
those O
hours O
of O
separation O
that O
must O
sometimes O
occur O
. O
In O
the O
absence O
of O
Jane O
, O
he O
always O
attached O
himself O
to O
Elizabeth O
for O
the O
pleasure O
of O
talking O
of O
her O
; O
and O
when O
Bingley O
was O
gone O
, O
Jane O
constantly O
sought O
the O
same O
means O
of O
relief O
. O
" O
He O
has O
made O
me O
so O
happy O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
one O
evening O
, O
" O
by O
telling O
me O
that O
he O
was O
totally O
ignorant O
of O
my O
being O
in O
town O
last O
spring O
! O
I O
had O
not O
believed O
it O
possible O
. O
" O
" O
I O
suspected O
as O
much O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
But O
how O
did O
he O
account O
for O
it O
? O
" O
" O
It O
must O
have O
been O
his O
sisters O
' O
doing O
. O
They O
were O
certainly O
no O
friends O
to O
his O
acquaintance O
with O
me O
, O
which O
I O
can O
not O
wonder O
at O
, O
since O
he O
might O
have O
chosen O
so O
much O
more O
advantageously O
in O
many O
respects O
. O
But O
when O
they O
see O
, O
as O
I O
trust O
they O
will O
, O
that O
their O
brother O
is O
happy O
with O
me O
, O
they O
will O
learn O
to O
be O
contented O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
be O
on O
good O
terms O
again O
: O
though O
we O
can O
never O
be O
what O
we O
once O
were O
to O
each O
other O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
the O
most O
unforgiving O
speech O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
you O
utter O
. O
Good O
girl O
! O
It O
would O
vex O
me O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
see O
you O
again O
the O
dupe O
of O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
pretended O
regard O
. O
" O
" O
Would O
you O
believe O
it O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
that O
when O
he O
went O
to O
town O
last O
November O
he O
really O
loved O
me O
, O
and O
nothing O
but O
a O
persuasion O
of O
_my_ O
being O
indifferent O
would O
have O
prevented O
his O
coming O
down O
again O
? O
" O
" O
He O
made O
a O
little O
mistake O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
; O
but O
it O
is O
to O
the O
credit O
of O
his O
modesty O
. O
" O
This O
naturally O
introduced O
a O
panegyric O
from O
Jane O
on O
his O
diffidence O
, O
and O
the O
little O
value O
he O
put O
on O
his O
own O
good O
qualities O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
pleased O
to O
find O
that O
he O
had O
not O
betrayed O
the O
interference O
of O
his O
friend O
; O
for O
, O
though O
Jane O
had O
the O
most O
generous O
and O
forgiving O
heart O
in O
the O
world O
, O
she O
knew O
it O
was O
a O
circumstance O
which O
must O
prejudice O
her O
against O
him O
. O
" O
I O
am O
certainly O
the O
most O
fortunate O
creature O
that O
ever O
existed O
! O
" O
cried O
Jane O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
why O
am O
I O
thus O
singled O
from O
my O
family O
, O
and O
blessed O
above O
them O
all O
? O
If O
I O
could O
but O
see O
you O
as O
happy O
! O
If O
there O
were O
but O
such O
another O
man O
for O
you O
! O
" O
" O
If O
you O
were O
to O
give O
me O
forty O
such O
men O
I O
never O
could O
be O
so O
happy O
as O
you O
. O
Till O
I O
have O
your O
disposition O
, O
your O
goodness O
, O
I O
never O
can O
have O
your O
happiness O
. O
No O
, O
no O
, O
let O
me O
shift O
for O
myself O
; O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
if O
I O
have O
very O
good O
luck O
, O
I O
may O
meet O
with O
another O
Mr. O
Collins O
in O
time O
. O
" O
The O
situation O
of O
affairs O
in O
the O
Longbourn O
family O
could O
not O
be O
long O
a O
secret O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
privileged O
to O
whisper O
it O
to O
Mrs. O
Philips O
, O
and O
she O
ventured O
, O
without O
any O
permission O
, O
to O
do O
the O
same O
by O
all O
her O
neighbours O
in O
Meryton O
. O
The O
Bennets O
were O
speedily O
pronounced O
to O
be O
the O
luckiest O
family O
in O
the O
world O
; O
though O
only O
a O
few O
weeks O
before O
, O
when O
Lydia O
had O
first O
run O
away O
, O
they O
had O
been O
generally O
proved O
to O
be O
marked O
out O
for O
misfortune O
