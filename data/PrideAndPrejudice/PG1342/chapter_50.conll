Mr. O
Bennet O
had O
very O
often O
wished O
, O
before O
this O
period O
of O
his O
life O
, O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
spending O
his O
whole O
income O
, O
he O
had O
laid O
by O
an O
annual O
sum O
, O
for O
the O
better O
provision O
of O
his O
children O
, O
and O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
if O
she O
survived O
him O
. O
He O
now O
wished O
it O
more O
than O
ever O
. O
Had O
he O
done O
his O
duty O
in O
that O
respect O
, O
Lydia O
need O
not O
have O
been O
indebted O
to O
her O
uncle O
for O
whatever O
of O
honour O
or O
credit O
could O
now O
be O
purchased O
for O
her O
. O
The O
satisfaction O
of O
prevailing O
on O
one O
of O
the O
most O
worthless O
young O
men O
in O
Great O
Britain O
to O
be O
her O
husband O
might O
then O
have O
rested O
in O
its O
proper O
place O
. O
He O
was O
seriously O
concerned O
that O
a O
cause O
of O
so O
little O
advantage O
to O
anyone O
should O
be O
forwarded O
at O
the O
sole O
expense O
of O
his O
brother-in-law O
; O
and O
he O
was O
determined O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
to O
find O
out O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
assistance O
, O
and O
to O
discharge O
the O
obligation O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
could O
. O
When O
first O
Mr. O
Bennet O
had O
married O
, O
economy O
was O
held O
to O
be O
perfectly O
useless O
; O
for O
, O
of O
course O
, O
they O
were O
to O
have O
a O
son O
. O
This O
son O
was O
to O
join O
in O
cutting O
off O
the O
entail O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
should O
be O
of O
age O
, O
and O
the O
widow O
and O
younger O
children O
would O
by O
that O
means O
be O
provided O
for O
. O
Five O
daughters O
successively O
entered O
the O
world O
, O
but O
yet O
the O
son O
was O
to O
come O
; O
and O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
, O
for O
many O
years O
after O
Lydia O
's O
birth O
, O
had O
been O
certain O
that O
he O
would O
. O
This O
event O
had O
at O
last O
been O
despaired O
of O
, O
but O
it O
was O
then O
too O
late O
to O
be O
saving O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
no O
turn O
for O
economy O
; O
and O
her O
husband O
's O
love O
of O
independence O
had O
alone O
prevented O
their O
exceeding O
their O
income O
. O
Five O
thousand O
pounds O
was O
settled O
by O
marriage O
articles O
on O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
and O
the O
children O
. O
But O
in O
what O
proportions O
it O
should O
be O
divided O
amongst O
the O
latter O
depended O
on O
the O
will O
of O
the O
parents O
. O
This O
was O
one O
point O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
Lydia O
at O
least O
, O
which O
was O
now O
to O
be O
settled O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Bennet O
could O
have O
no O
hesitation O
in O
acceding O
to O
the O
proposal O
before O
him O
. O
In O
terms O
of O
grateful O
acknowledgment O
for O
the O
kindness O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
though O
expressed O
most O
concisely O
, O
he O
then O
delivered O
on O
paper O
his O
perfect O
approbation O
of O
all O
that O
was O
done O
, O
and O
his O
willingness O
to O
fulfil O
the O
engagements O
that O
had O
been O
made O
for O
him O
. O
He O
had O
never O
before O
supposed O
that O
, O
could O
Wickham O
be O
prevailed O
on O
to O
marry O
his O
daughter O
, O
it O
would O
be O
done O
with O
so O
little O
inconvenience O
to O
himself O
as O
by O
the O
present O
arrangement O
. O
He O
would O
scarcely O
be O
ten O
pounds O
a O
year O
the O
loser O
, O
by O
the O
hundred O
that O
was O
to O
be O
paid O
them O
; O
for O
, O
what O
with O
her O
board O
and O
pocket O
allowance O
, O
and O
the O
continual O
presents O
in O
money O
which O
passed O
to O
her O
through O
her O
mother O
's O
hands O
, O
Lydia O
's O
expenses O
had O
been O
very O
little O
within O
that O
sum O
. O
That O
it O
would O
be O
done O
with O
such O
trifling O
exertion O
on O
his O
side O
, O
too O
, O
was O
another O
very O
welcome O
surprise O
; O
for O
his O
chief O
wish O
at O
present O
was O
to O
have O
as O
little O
trouble O
in O
the O
business O
as O
possible O
. O
When O
the O
first O
transports O
of O
rage O
which O
had O
produced O
his O
activity O
in O
seeking O
her O
were O
over O
, O
he O
naturally O
returned O
to O
all O
his O
former O
indolence O
. O
His O
letter O
was O
soon O
despatched O
; O
for O
though O
dilatory O
in O
undertaking O
business O
, O
he O
was O
quick O
in O
its O
execution O
. O
He O
begged O
to O
know O
further O
particulars O
of O
what O
he O
was O
indebted O
to O
his O
brother O
; O
but O
was O
too O
angry O
with O
Lydia O
to O
send O
any O
message O
to O
her O
. O
The O
good O
news O
quickly O
spread O
through O
the O
house O
; O
and O
with O
proportionate O
speed O
through O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O
It O
was O
borne O
in O
the O
latter O
with O
decent O
philosophy O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
would O
have O
been O
more O
for O
the O
advantage O
of O
conversation O
, O
had O
Miss O
Lydia O
Bennet O
come O
upon O
the O
town O
; O
or O
, O
as O
the O
happiest O
alternative O
, O
been O
secluded O
from O
the O
world O
in O
some O
distant O
farm-house O
. O
But O
there O
was O
much O
to O
be O
talked O
of O
, O
in O
marrying O
her O
; O
and O
the O
good-natured O
wishes O
for O
her O
well-doing O
, O
which O
had O
proceeded O
before O
from O
all O
the O
spiteful O
old O
ladies O
in O
Meryton O
, O
lost O
but O
little O
of O
their O
spirit O
in O
this O
change O
of O
circumstances O
, O
because O
with O
such O
a O
husband O
her O
misery O
was O
considered O
certain O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fortnight O
since O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
been O
down O
stairs O
, O
but O
on O
this O
happy O
day O
she O
again O
took O
her O
seat O
at O
the O
head O
of O
her O
table O
, O
and O
in O
spirits O
oppressively O
high O
. O
No O
sentiment O
of O
shame O
gave O
a O
damp O
to O
her O
triumph O
. O
The O
marriage O
of O
a O
daughter O
, O
which O
had O
been O
the O
first O
object O
of O
her O
wishes O
since O
Jane O
was O
sixteen O
, O
was O
now O
on O
the O
point O
of O
accomplishment O
, O
and O
her O
thoughts O
and O
her O
words O
ran O
wholly O
on O
those O
attendants O
of O
elegant O
nuptials O
, O
fine O
muslins O
, O
new O
carriages O
, O
and O
servants O
. O
She O
was O
busily O
searching O
through O
the O
neighbourhood O
for O
a O
proper O
situation O
for O
her O
daughter O
; O
and O
, O
without O
knowing O
or O
considering O
what O
their O
income O
might O
be O
, O
rejected O
many O
as O
deficient O
in O
size O
and O
importance O
. O
" O
Haye O
Park O
might O
do O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
if O
the O
Gouldings O
would O
quit O
it O
, O
or O
the O
great O
house O
at O
Stoke O
, O
if O
the O
drawing-room O
were O
larger O
; O
but O
Ashworth O
is O
too O
far O
off O
. O
I O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
have O
her O
ten O
miles O
from O
me O
; O
and O
as O
for O
Purvis O
Lodge O
, O
the O
attics O
are O
dreadful O
. O
" O
Her O
husband O
allowed O
her O
to O
talk O
on O
without O
interruption O
while O
the O
servants O
remained O
. O
But O
when O
they O
had O
withdrawn O
, O
he O
said O
to O
her O
, O
" O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
, O
before O
you O
take O
any O
, O
or O
all O
of O
these O
houses O
, O
for O
your O
son O
and O
daughter O
, O
let O
us O
come O
to O
a O
right O
understanding O
. O
Into O
_one_ O
house O
in O
this O
neighbourhood O
they O
shall O
never O
have O
admittance O
. O
I O
will O
not O
encourage O
the O
imprudence O
of O
either O
, O
by O
receiving O
them O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
" O
A O
long O
dispute O
followed O
this O
declaration O
; O
but O
Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
firm O
: O
it O
soon O
led O
to O
another O
; O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
found O
, O
with O
amazement O
and O
horror O
, O
that O
her O
husband O
would O
not O
advance O
a O
guinea O
to O
buy O
clothes O
for O
his O
daughter O
. O
He O
protested O
that O
she O
should O
receive O
from O
him O
no O
mark O
of O
affection O
whatever O
on O
the O
occasion O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
could O
hardly O
comprehend O
it O
. O
That O
his O
anger O
could O
be O
carried O
to O
such O
a O
point O
of O
inconceivable O
resentment O
as O
to O
refuse O
his O
daughter O
a O
privilege O
, O
without O
which O
her O
marriage O
would O
scarcely O
seem O
valid O
, O
exceeded O
all O
that O
she O
could O
believe O
possible O
. O
She O
was O
more O
alive O
to O
the O
disgrace O
, O
which O
her O
want O
of O
new O
clothes O
must O
reflect O
on O
her O
daughter O
's O
nuptials O
, O
than O
to O
any O
sense O
of O
shame O
at O
her O
eloping O
and O
living O
with O
Wickham O
a O
fortnight O
before O
they O
took O
place O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
now O
most O
heartily O
sorry O
that O
she O
had O
, O
from O
the O
distress O
of O
the O
moment O
, O
been O
led O
to O
make O
Mr. O
Darcy O
acquainted O
with O
their O
fears O
for O
her O
sister O
; O
for O
since O
her O
marriage O
would O
so O
shortly O
give O
the O
proper O
termination O
to O
the O
elopement O
, O
they O
might O
hope O
to O
conceal O
its O
unfavourable O
beginning O
from O
all O
those O
who O
were O
not O
immediately O
on O
the O
spot O
. O
She O
had O
no O
fear O
of O
its O
spreading O
farther O
, O
through O
his O
means O
. O
There O
were O
few O
people O
on O
whose O
secrecy O
she O
would O
have O
more O
confidently O
depended O
; O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
there O
was O
no O
one O
whose O
knowledge O
of O
a O
sister O
's O
frailty O
would O
have O
mortified O
her O
so O
much O
. O
Not O
, O
however O
, O
from O
any O
fear O
of O
disadvantage O
from O
it O
individually O
to O
herself O
; O
for O
at O
any O
rate O
there O
seemed O
a O
gulf O
impassable O
between O
them O
. O
Had O
Lydia O
's O
marriage O
been O
concluded O
on O
the O
most O
honourable O
terms O
, O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
would O
connect O
himself O
with O
a O
family O
, O
where O
to O
every O
other O
objection O
would O
now O
be O
added O
an O
alliance O
and O
relationship O
of O
the O
nearest O
kind O
with O
the O
man O
whom O
he O
so O
justly O
scorned O
. O
From O
such O
a O
connection O
she O
could O
not O
wonder O
that O
he O
should O
shrink O
. O
The O
wish O
of O
procuring O
her O
regard O
, O
which O
she O
had O
assured O
herself O
of O
his O
feeling O
in O
Derbyshire O
, O
could O
not O
in O
rational O
expectation O
survive O
such O
a O
blow O
as O
this O
. O
She O
was O
humbled O
, O
she O
was O
grieved O
; O
she O
repented O
, O
though O
she O
hardly O
knew O
of O
what O
. O
She O
became O
jealous O
of O
his O
esteem O
, O
when O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
hope O
to O
be O
benefited O
by O
it O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
hear O
of O
him O
, O
when O
there O
seemed O
the O
least O
chance O
of O
gaining O
intelligence O
. O
She O
was O
convinced O
that O
she O
could O
have O
been O
happy O
with O
him O
, O
when O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
likely O
they O
should O
meet O
. O
What O
a O
triumph O
for O
him O
, O
as O
she O
often O
thought O
, O
could O
he O
know O
that O
the O
proposals O
which O
she O
had O
proudly O
spurned O
only O
four O
months O
ago O
would O
now O
have O
been O
gladly O
and O
gratefully O
received O
! O
He O
was O
as O
generous O
, O
she O
doubted O
not O
, O
as O
the O
most O
generous O
of O
his O
sex O
. O
But O
while O
he O
was O
mortal O
, O
there O
must O
be O
a O
triumph O
. O
She O
began O
now O
to O
comprehend O
that O
he O
was O
exactly O
the O
man O
who O
, O
in O
disposition O
and O
talents O
, O
would O
most O
suit O
her O
. O
His O
understanding O
and O
temper O
, O
though O
unlike O
her O
own O
, O
would O
have O
answered O
all O
her O
wishes O
. O
It O
was O
an O
union O
that O
must O
have O
been O
to O
the O
advantage O
of O
both O
: O
by O
her O
ease O
and O
liveliness O
, O
his O
mind O
might O
have O
been O
softened O
, O
his O
manners O
improved O
; O
and O
from O
his O
judgment O
, O
information O
, O
and O
knowledge O
of O
the O
world O
, O
she O
must O
have O
received O
benefit O
of O
greater O
importance O
. O
But O
no O
such O
happy O
marriage O
could O
now O
teach O
the O
admiring O
multitude O
what O
connubial O
felicity O
really O
was O
. O
An O
union O
of O
a O
different O
tendency O
, O
and O
precluding O
the O
possibility O
of O
the O
other O
, O
was O
soon O
to O
be O
formed O
in O
their O
family O
. O
How O
Wickham O
and O
Lydia O
were O
to O
be O
supported O
in O
tolerable O
independence O
she O
could O
not O
imagine O
. O
But O
how O
little O
of O
permanent O
happiness O
could O
belong O
to O
a O
couple O
who O
were O
only O
brought O
together O
because O
their O
passions O
were O
stronger O
than O
their O
virtue O
, O
she O
could O
easily O
conjecture O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
soon O
wrote O
again O
to O
his O
brother O
. O
To O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
acknowledgments O
he O
briefly O
replied O
, O
with O
assurances O
of O
his O
eagerness O
to O
promote O
the O
welfare O
of O
any O
of O
his O
family O
; O
and O
concluded O
with O
entreaties O
that O
the O
subject O
might O
never O
be O
mentioned O
to O
him O
again O
. O
The O
principal O
purport O
of O
his O
letter O
was O
to O
inform O
them O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Wickham O
had O
resolved O
on O
quitting O
the O
militia O
. O
" O
It O
was O
greatly O
my O
wish O
that O
he O
should O
do O
so O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
" O
as O
soon O
as O
his O
marriage O
was O
fixed O
on O
. O
And O
I O
think O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
me O
, O
in O
considering O
a O
removal O
from O
that O
corps O
as O
highly O
advisable O
, O
both O
on O
his O
account O
and O
my O
niece O
's O
. O
It O
is O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
intention O
to O
go O
into O
the O
Regulars O
; O
and O
, O
among O
his O
former O
friends O
, O
there O
are O
still O
some O
who O
are O
able O
and O
willing O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
the O
army O
. O
He O
has O
the O
promise O
of O
an O
ensigncy O
in O
General O
-- O
-- O
's O
regiment O
, O
now O
quartered O
in O
the O
north O
. O
It O
is O
an O
advantage O
to O
have O
it O
so O
far O
from O
this O
part O
of O
the O
kingdom O
. O
He O
promises O
fairly O
; O
and O
I O
hope O
among O
different O
people O
, O
where O
they O
may O
each O
have O
a O
character O
to O
preserve O
, O
they O
will O
both O
be O
more O
prudent O
. O
I O
have O
written O
to O
Colonel O
Forster O
, O
to O
inform O
him O
of O
our O
present O
arrangements O
, O
and O
to O
request O
that O
he O
will O
satisfy O
the O
various O
creditors O
of O
Mr. O
Wickham O
in O
and O
near O
Brighton O
with O
assurances O
of O
speedy O
payment O
, O
for O
which O
I O
have O
pledged O
myself O
. O
And O
will O
you O
give O
yourself O
the O
trouble O
of O

" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
and O
his O
daughters O
saw O
all O
the O
advantages O
of O
Wickham O
's O
removal O
from O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
, O
as O
clearly O
as O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
could O
do O
. O
But O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
not O
so O
well O
pleased O
with O
it O
. O
Lydia O
's O
being O
settled O
in O
the O
north O
, O
just O
when O
she O
had O
expected O
most O
pleasure O
and O
pride O
in O
her O
company O
, O
for O
she O
had O
by O
no O
means O
given O
up O
her O
plan O
of O
their O
residing O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
was O
a O
severe O
disappointment O
; O
and O
, O
besides O
, O
it O
was O
such O
a O
pity O
that O
Lydia O
should O
be O
taken O
from O
a O
regiment O
where O
she O
was O
acquainted O
with O
everybody O
, O
and O
had O
so O
many O
favourites O
. O
" O
She O
is O
so O
fond O
of O
Mrs. O
Forster O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
it O
will O
be O
quite O
shocking O
to O
send O
her O
away O
! O
And O
there O
are O
several O
of O
the O
young O
men O
, O
too O
, O
that O
she O
likes O
very O
much O
. O
The O
officers O
may O
not O
be O
so O
pleasant O
in O
General O

" O
His O
daughter O
's O
request O
, O
for O
such O
it O
might O
be O
considered O
, O
of O
being O
admitted O
into O
her O
family O
again O
, O
before O
she O
set O
off O
for O
the O
north O

received O
at O
first O
an O
absolute O
negative O
. O
But O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
agreed O
in O
wishing O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
their O
sister O
's O
feelings O
and O
consequence O
, O
that O
she O
should O
be O
noticed O
on O
her O
marriage O
by O
her O
parents O
, O
urged O
him O
so O
earnestly O
, O
yet O
so O
rationally O
and O
so O
mildly O
, O
to O
receive O
her O
and O
her O
husband O
at O
Longbourn O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
married O
, O
that O
he O
was O
prevailed O
on O
to O
think O
as O
they O
thought O
, O
and O
act O
as O
they O
wished O

And O
their O
mother O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
knowing O
, O
that O
she O
should O
be O
able O
to O
show O
her O
married O
daughter O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O

before O
she O
was O
banished O
to O
the O
north O

When O
Mr. O
Bennet O
wrote O
again O
to O
his O
brother O
, O
therefore O
, O
he O
sent O
his O
permission O
for O
them O
to O
come O
; O
and O
it O
was O
settled O
, O
that O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
ceremony O
was O
over O
, O
they O
should O
proceed O
to O
Longbourn O

Elizabeth O
was O
surprised O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Wickham O
should O
consent O
to O
such O
a O
scheme O
; O
and O
, O
had O
she O
consulted O
only O
her O

inclination O

any O
meeting O

have O
been O
the O
