" O
My O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
where O
can O
you O
have O
been O
walking O
to O
? O
" O
was O
a O
question O
which O
Elizabeth O
received O
from O
Jane O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
entered O
the O
room O
, O
and O
from O
all O
the O
others O
when O
they O
sat O
down O
to O
table O
. O
She O
had O
only O
to O
say O
in O
reply O
, O
that O
they O
had O
wandered O
about O
till O
she O
was O
beyond O
her O
own O
knowledge O
. O
She O
coloured O
as O
she O
spoke O
; O
but O
neither O
that O
, O
nor O
anything O
else O
, O
awakened O
a O
suspicion O
of O
the O
truth O
. O
The O
evening O
passed O
quietly O
, O
unmarked O
by O
anything O
extraordinary O
. O
The O
acknowledged O
lovers O
talked O
and O
laughed O
; O
the O
unacknowledged O
were O
silent O
. O
Darcy O
was O
not O
of O
a O
disposition O
in O
which O
happiness O
overflows O
in O
mirth O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
agitated O
and O
confused O
, O
rather O
_knew_ O
that O
she O
was O
happy O
than O
_felt_ O
herself O
to O
be O
so O
; O
for O
, O
besides O
the O
immediate O
embarrassment O
, O
there O
were O
other O
evils O
before O
her O
. O
She O
anticipated O
what O
would O
be O
felt O
in O
the O
family O
when O
her O
situation O
became O
known O
: O
she O
was O
aware O
that O
no O
one O
liked O
him O
but O
Jane O
; O
and O
even O
feared O
that O
with O
the O
others O
it O
was O
a O
_dislike_ O
which O
not O
all O
his O
fortune O
and O
consequence O
might O
do O
away O
. O
At O
night O
she O
opened O
her O
heart O
to O
Jane O
. O
Though O
suspicion O
was O
very O
far O
from O
Miss O
Bennet O
's O
general O
habits O
, O
she O
was O
absolutely O
incredulous O
here O
. O
" O
You O
are O
joking O
, O
Lizzy O
. O
This O
can O
not O
be O
! O
Engaged O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
! O
No O
, O
no O
, O
you O
shall O
not O
deceive O
me O
: O
I O
know O
it O
to O
be O
impossible O
. O
" O
" O
This O
is O
a O
wretched O
beginning O
, O
indeed O
! O
My O
sole O
dependence O
was O
on O
you O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
nobody O
else O
will O
believe O
me O
, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
. O
Yet O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
am O
in O
earnest O
. O
I O
speak O
nothing O
but O
the O
truth O
. O
He O
still O
loves O
me O
, O
and O
we O
are O
engaged O
. O
" O
Jane O
looked O
at O
her O
doubtingly O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Lizzy O
! O
it O
can O
not O
be O
. O
I O
know O
how O
much O
you O
dislike O
him O
. O
" O
" O
You O
know O
nothing O
of O
the O
matter O
. O
_That_ O
is O
all O
to O
be O
forgot O
. O
Perhaps O
I O
did O
not O
always O
love O
him O
so O
well O
as O
I O
do O
now O
; O
but O
in O
such O
cases O
as O
these O
a O
good O
memory O
is O
unpardonable O
. O
This O
is O
the O
last O
time O
I O
shall O
ever O
remember O
it O
myself O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bennet O
still O
looked O
all O
amazement O
. O
Elizabeth O
again O
, O
and O
more O
seriously O
, O
assured O
her O
of O
its O
truth O
. O
" O
Good O
heaven O
! O
can O
it O
be O
really O
so O
? O
Yet O
now O
I O
must O
believe O
you O
, O
" O
cried O
Jane O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
I O
would O
, O
I O
do O
congratulate O
you O
; O
but O
are O
you O
certain O
-- O
forgive O
the O
question O
-- O
are O
you O
quite O
certain O
that O
you O
can O
be O
happy O
with O
him O
? O
" O
" O
There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
of O
that O
. O
It O
is O
settled O
between O
us O
already O
that O
we O
are O
to O
be O
the O
happiest O
couple O
in O
the O
world O
. O
But O
are O
you O
pleased O
, O
Jane O
? O
Shall O
you O
like O
to O
have O
such O
a O
brother O
? O
" O
" O
Very O
, O
very O
much O
. O
Nothing O
could O
give O
either O
Bingley O
or O
myself O
more O
delight O
. O
But O
we O
considered O
it O
, O
we O
talked O
of O
it O
as O
impossible O
. O
And O
do O
you O
really O
love O
him O
quite O
well O
enough O
? O
Oh O
, O
Lizzy O
! O
do O
anything O
rather O
than O
marry O
without O
affection O
. O
Are O
you O
quite O
sure O
that O
you O
feel O
what O
you O
ought O
to O
do O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
You O
will O
only O
think O
I O
feel O
_more_ O
than O
I O
ought O
to O
do O
when O
I O
tell O
you O
all O
. O
" O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
I O
love O
him O
better O
than O
I O
do O
Bingley O
. O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
will O
be O
angry O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dearest O
sister O
, O
now O
be O
, O
_be_ O
serious O
. O
I O
want O
to O
talk O
very O
seriously O
. O
Let O
me O
know O
everything O
that O
I O
am O
to O
know O
without O
delay O
. O
Will O
you O
tell O
me O
how O
long O
you O
have O
loved O
him O
? O
" O
" O
It O
has O
been O
coming O
on O
so O
gradually O
, O
that O
I O
hardly O
know O
when O
it O
began O
; O
but O
I O
believe O
I O
must O
date O
it O
from O
my O
first O
seeing O
his O
beautiful O
grounds O
at O
Pemberley O
. O
" O
Another O
entreaty O
that O
she O
would O
be O
serious O
, O
however O
, O
produced O
the O
desired O
effect O
; O
and O
she O
soon O
satisfied O
Jane O
by O
her O
solemn O
assurances O
of O
attachment O
. O
When O
convinced O
on O
that O
article O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
had O
nothing O
further O
to O
wish O
. O
" O
Now O
I O
am O
quite O
happy O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
for O
you O
will O
be O
as O
happy O
as O
myself O
. O
I O
always O
had O
a O
value O
for O
him O
. O
Were O
it O
for O
nothing O
but O
his O
love O
of O
you O
, O
I O
must O
always O
have O
esteemed O
him O
; O
but O
now O
, O
as O
Bingley O
's O
friend O
and O
your O
husband O
, O
there O
can O
be O
only O
Bingley O
and O
yourself O
more O
dear O
to O
me O
. O
But O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
you O
have O
been O
very O
sly O
, O
very O
reserved O
with O
me O
. O
How O
little O
did O
you O
tell O
me O
of O
what O
passed O
at O
Pemberley O
and O
Lambton O
! O
I O
owe O
all O
that O
I O
know O
of O
it O
to O
another O
, O
not O
to O
you O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
told O
her O
the O
motives O
of O
her O
secrecy O
. O
She O
had O
been O
unwilling O
to O
mention O
Bingley O
; O
and O
the O
unsettled O
state O
of O
her O
own O
feelings O
had O
made O
her O
equally O
avoid O
the O
name O
of O
his O
friend O
: O
but O
now O
she O
would O
no O
longer O
conceal O
from O
her O
his O
share O
in O
Lydia O
's O
marriage O
. O
All O
was O
acknowledged O
, O
and O
half O
the O
night O
spent O
in O
conversation O
. O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
" O
cried O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
as O
she O
stood O
at O
a O
window O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
" O
if O
that O
disagreeable O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
not O
coming O
here O
again O
with O
our O
dear O
Bingley O
! O
What O
can O
he O
mean O
by O
being O
so O
tiresome O
as O
to O
be O
always O
coming O
here O
? O
I O
had O
no O
notion O
but O
he O
would O
go O
a-shooting O
, O
or O
something O
or O
other O
, O
and O
not O
disturb O
us O
with O
his O
company O
. O
What O
shall O
we O
do O
with O
him O
? O
Lizzy O
, O
you O
must O
walk O
out O
with O
him O
again O
, O
that O
he O
may O
not O
be O
in O
Bingley O
's O
way O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
hardly O
help O
laughing O
at O
so O
convenient O
a O
proposal O
; O
yet O
was O
really O
vexed O
that O
her O
mother O
should O
be O
always O
giving O
him O
such O
an O
epithet O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
they O
entered O
, O
Bingley O
looked O
at O
her O
so O
expressively O
, O
and O
shook O
hands O
with O
such O
warmth O
, O
as O
left O
no O
doubt O
of O
his O
good O
information O
; O
and O
he O
soon O
afterwards O
said O
aloud O
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
have O
you O
no O
more O
lanes O
hereabouts O
in O
which O
Lizzy O
may O
lose O
her O
way O
again O
to-day O
? O
" O
" O
I O
advise O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
and O
Lizzy O
, O
and O
Kitty O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
to O
walk O
to O
Oakham O
Mount O
this O
morning O
. O
It O
is O
a O
nice O
long O
walk O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Darcy O
has O
never O
seen O
the O
view O
. O
" O
" O
It O
may O
do O
very O
well O
for O
the O
others O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Bingley O
; O
" O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
will O
be O
too O
much O
for O
Kitty O
. O
Wo O
n't O
it O
, O
Kitty O
? O
" O
Kitty O
owned O
that O
she O
had O
rather O
stay O
at O
home O
. O
Darcy O
professed O
a O
great O
curiosity O
to O
see O
the O
view O
from O
the O
Mount O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
silently O
consented O
. O
As O
she O
went O
upstairs O
to O
get O
ready O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
followed O
her O
, O
saying O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
am O
quite O
sorry O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
that O
you O
should O
be O
forced O
to O
have O
that O
disagreeable O
man O
all O
to O
yourself O
; O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
not O
mind O
it O
. O
It O
is O
all O
for O
Jane O
's O
sake O
, O
you O
know O
; O
and O
there O
is O
no O
occasion O
for O
talking O
to O
him O
except O
just O
now O
and O
then O
; O
so O
do O
not O
put O
yourself O
to O
inconvenience O
. O
" O
During O
their O
walk O
, O
it O
was O
resolved O
that O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
consent O
should O
be O
asked O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
: O
Elizabeth O
reserved O
to O
herself O
the O
application O
for O
her O
mother O
's O
. O
She O
could O
not O
determine O
how O
her O
mother O
would O
take O
it O
; O
sometimes O
doubting O
whether O
all O
his O
wealth O
and O
grandeur O
would O
be O
enough O
to O
overcome O
her O
abhorrence O
of O
the O
man O
; O
but O
whether O
she O
were O
violently O
set O
against O
the O
match O
, O
or O
violently O
delighted O
with O
it O
, O
it O
was O
certain O
that O
her O
manner O
would O
be O
equally O
ill O
adapted O
to O
do O
credit O
to O
her O
sense O
; O
and O
she O
could O
no O
more O
bear O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
should O
hear O
the O
first O
raptures O
of O
her O
joy O
, O
than O
the O
first O
vehemence O
of O
her O
disapprobation O
. O
In O
the O
evening O
, O
soon O
after O
Mr. O
Bennet O
withdrew O
to O
the O
library O
, O
she O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy O
rise O
also O
and O
follow O
him O
, O
and O
her O
agitation O
on O
seeing O
it O
was O
extreme O
. O
She O
did O
not O
fear O
her O
father O
's O
opposition O
, O
but O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
made O
unhappy O
, O
and O
that O
it O
should O
be O
through O
her O
means O
; O
that O
_she_ O
, O
his O
favourite O
child O
, O
should O
be O
distressing O
him O
by O
her O
choice O
, O
should O
be O
filling O
him O
with O
fears O
and O
regrets O
in O
disposing O
of O
her O
, O
was O
a O
wretched O
reflection O
, O
and O
she O
sat O
in O
misery O
till O
Mr. O
Darcy O
appeared O
again O
, O
when O
, O
looking O
at O
him O
, O
she O
was O
a O
little O
relieved O
by O
his O
smile O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
he O
approached O
the O
table O
where O
she O
was O
sitting O
with O
Kitty O
; O
and O
, O
while O
pretending O
to O
admire O
her O
work O
, O
said O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
" O
Go O
to O
your O
father O
; O
he O
wants O
you O
in O
the O
library O
. O
" O
She O
was O
gone O
directly O
. O
Her O
father O
was O
walking O
about O
the O
room O
, O
looking O
grave O
and O
anxious O
. O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
what O
are O
you O
doing O
? O
Are O
you O
out O
of O
your O
senses O
to O
be O
accepting O
this O
man O
? O
Have O
not O
you O
always O
hated O
him O
? O
" O
How O
earnestly O
did O
she O
then O
wish O
that O
her O
former O
opinions O
had O
been O
more O
reasonable O
, O
her O
expressions O
more O
moderate O
! O
It O
would O
have O
spared O
her O
from O
explanations O
and O
professions O
which O
it O
was O
exceedingly O
awkward O
to O
give O
; O
but O
they O
were O
now O
necessary O
, O
and O
she O
assured O
him O
, O
with O
some O
confusion O
, O
of O
her O
attachment O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
" O
Or O
, O
in O
other O
words O
, O
you O
are O
determined O
to O
have O
him O
. O
He O
is O
rich O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
and O
you O
may O
have O
more O
fine O
clothes O
and O
fine O
carriages O
than O
Jane O
. O
But O
will O
they O
make O
you O
happy O
? O
" O
" O
Have O
you O
any O
other O
objection O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
than O
your O
belief O
of O
my O
indifference O
? O
" O
" O
None O
at O
all O
. O
We O
all O
know O
him O
to O
be O
a O
proud O
, O
unpleasant O
sort O
of O
man O
; O
but O
this O
would O
be O
nothing O
if O
you O
really O
liked O
him O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
, O
I O
do O
like O
him O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
with O
tears O
in O
her O
eyes O
; O
" O
I O
love O
him O
. O
Indeed O
he O
has O
no O
improper O
pride O
. O
He O
is O
perfectly O
amiable O
. O
You O
do O
not O
know O
what O
he O
really O
is O
; O
then O
pray O
do O
not O
pain O
me O
by O
speaking O
of O
him O
in O
such O
terms O
. O
" O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
her O
father O
, O
" O
I O
have O
given O
him O
my O
consent O
. O
He O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
man O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
whom O
I O
should O
never O
dare O
refuse O
anything O
, O
which O
he O
condescended O
to O
ask O
. O
I O
now O
give O
it O
to O
_you_ O
, O
if O
you O
are O
resolved O
on O
having O
him O
. O
But O
let O
me O
advise O
you O
to O
think O
better O
of O
it O
. O
I O
know O
your O
disposition O
, O
Lizzy O
. O
I O
know O
that O
you O
could O
be O
neither O
happy O
nor O
respectable O
, O
unless O
you O
truly O
esteemed O
your O
husband O
, O
unless O
you O
looked O
up O
to O
him O
as O
a O
superior O
. O
Your O
lively O
talents O
would O
place O
you O
in O
the O
greatest O
danger O
in O
an O
unequal O
marriage O

You O
could O
scarcely O
escape O
discredit O
and O
misery O
. O
My O
child O
, O
let O
me O
not O
have O
the O
grief O
of O
seeing O
_you_ O
unable O
to O
respect O
your O
partner O
in O
life O
. O
You O
know O
not O
what O
you O
are O
about O

still O
more O
affected O
, O
was O
earnest O
and O
solemn O
in O
her O
reply O
; O
and O
, O
at O
length O
, O
by O
repeated O
assurances O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
really O
the O
object O
of O
her O
choice O
, O
by O
explaining O
the O
gradual O
change O
which O
her O
estimation O
of O
him O
had O
undergone O
, O
relating O
her O
absolute O
certainty O
that O
his O
affection O
was O
not O
the O
work O
of O
a O
day O
, O
but O
had O
stood O
the O
test O
of O
many O
months O
' O
suspense O
, O
and O
enumerating O
with O
energy O
all O
his O
good O
qualities O
, O
she O
did O
conquer O
her O
father O
's O
incredulity O
, O
and O
reconcile O
him O
to O
the O
match O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
when O
she O
ceased O
speaking O
, O
" O
I O
have O
no O
more O
to O
say O
. O
If O
this O
be O
the O
case O
, O
he O
deserves O
you O
. O
I O
could O
not O
have O
parted O
with O
you O
, O
my O
Lizzy O
, O
to O
anyone O
less O
worthy O
. O
" O
To O
complete O
the O
favourable O
impression O
, O
she O
then O
told O
him O
what O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
voluntarily O
done O
for O
Lydia O
. O
He O
heard O
her O
with O
astonishment O
. O
" O
This O
is O
an O
evening O
of O
wonders O
, O
indeed O
! O
And O
so O
, O
Darcy O
did O
everything O
; O
made O
up O
the O
match O
, O
gave O
the O
money O
, O
paid O
the O
fellow O
's O
debts O
, O
and O
got O
him O
his O
commission O
! O
So O
much O
the O
better O
. O
It O
will O
save O
me O
a O
world O
of O
trouble O
and O
economy O
. O
Had O
it O
been O
your O
uncle O
's O
doing O
, O
I O
must O
and O
_would_ O
have O
paid O
him O
; O
but O
these O
violent O
young O
lovers O
carry O
everything O
their O
own O
way O
. O
I O
shall O
offer O
to O
pay O
him O
to-morrow O
, O
he O
will O
rant O
and O
storm O
about O
his O
love O
for O
you O
, O
and O
there O
will O
be O
an O
end O
of O
the O
matter O
. O
" O
He O
then O
recollected O
her O
embarrassment O
a O
few O
days O
before O
on O
his O
reading O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
letter O
; O
and O
after O
laughing O
at O
her O
some O
time O
, O
allowed O
her O
at O
last O
to O
go O
, O
saying O
, O
as O
she O
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
" O
If O
any O
young O
men O
come O
for O
Mary O
or O
Kitty O
, O
send O
them O
in O
, O
for O
I O
am O
quite O
at O
leisure O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
's O
mind O
was O
now O
relieved O
from O
a O
very O
heavy O
weight O
; O
and O
, O
after O
half O
an O
hour O
's O
quiet O
reflection O
in O
her O
own O
room O
, O
she O
was O
able O
to O
join O
the O
others O
with O
tolerable O
composure O
. O
Everything O
was O
too O
recent O
for O
gaiety O
, O
but O
the O
evening O
passed O
tranquilly O
away O
; O
there O
was O
no O
longer O
anything O
material O
to O
be O
dreaded O
, O
and O
the O
comfort O
of O
ease O
and O
familiarity O
would O
come O
in O
time O
. O
When O
her O
mother O
went O
up O
to O
her O
dressing-room O
at O
night O
, O
she O
followed O
her O
, O
and O
made O
the O
important O
communication O
. O
Its O
effect O
was O
most O
extraordinary O
; O
for O
, O
on O
first O
hearing O
it O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
sat O
quite O
still O
, O
and O
unable O
to O
utter O
a O
syllable O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
under O
many O
, O
many O
minutes O
, O
that O
she O
could O
comprehend O
what O
she O
heard O
, O
though O
not O
in O
general O
backward O
to O
credit O
what O
was O
for O
the O
advantage O
of O
her O
family O
, O
or O
that O
came O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
lover O
to O
any O
of O
them O
. O
She O
began O
at O
length O
to O
recover O
, O
to O
fidget O
about O
in O
her O
chair O
, O
get O
up O
, O
sit O
down O
again O
, O
wonder O
, O
and O
bless O
herself O
. O
" O
Good O
gracious O
! O
Lord O
bless O
me O
! O
only O
think O
! O
dear O
me O
! O
Mr. O
Darcy O
! O
Who O
would O
have O
thought O
it O
? O
And O
is O
it O
really O
true O
? O
Oh O
, O
my O
sweetest O
Lizzy O
! O
how O
rich O
and O
how O
great O
you O
will O
be O
! O
What O
pin-money O
, O
what O
jewels O
, O
what O
carriages O
you O
will O
have O
! O
Jane O
's O
is O
nothing O
to O
it O
-- O
nothing O
at O
all O
. O
I O
am O
so O
pleased O
-- O
so O
happy O
. O
Such O
a O
charming O
man O
! O
so O
handsome O
! O
so O
tall O
! O
Oh O
, O
my O
dear O
Lizzy O
! O
pray O
apologize O
for O
my O
having O
disliked O
him O
so O
much O
before O
. O
I O
hope O
he O
will O
overlook O
it O
. O
Dear O
, O
dear O
Lizzy O
. O
A O
house O
in O
town O
! O
Everything O
that O
is O
charming O
! O
Three O
daughters O
married O
! O
Ten O
thousand O
a O
year O
! O
Oh O
, O
Lord O
! O
what O
will O
become O
of O
me O
? O
I O
shall O
go O
distracted O
. O
" O
This O
was O
enough O
to O
prove O
that O
her O
approbation O
need O
not O
be O
doubted O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
rejoicing O
that O
such O
an O
effusion O
was O
heard O
only O
by O
herself O
, O
soon O
went O
away O
. O
But O
before O
she O
had O
been O
three O
minutes O
in O
her O
own O
room O
, O
her O
mother O
followed O
her O
. O
" O
My O
dearest O
child O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
, O
" O
I O
can O
think O
of O
nothing O
else O
. O
Ten O
thousand O
a O
year O
, O
and O
very O
likely O
more O
! O
'T O
is O
as O
good O
as O
a O
lord O
! O
And O
a O
special O
licence O
-- O
you O
must O
and O
shall O
be O
married O
by O
a O
special O
licence O
. O
But O
, O
my O
dearest O
love O
, O
tell O
me O
what O
dish O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
particularly O
fond O
of O
, O
that O
I O
may O
have O
it O
to-morrow O
. O
" O
This O
was O
a O
sad O
omen O
of O
what O
her O
mother O
's O
behaviour O
to O
the O
gentleman O
himself O
might O
be O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
found O
that O
, O
though O
in O
the O
certain O
possession O
of O
his O
warmest O
affection O
, O
and O
secure O
of O
her O
relations O
' O
consent O
, O
there O
was O
still O
something O
to O
be O
wished O
for O
. O
But O
the O
morrow O
passed O
off O
much O
better O
than O
she O
expected O
; O
for O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
luckily O
stood O
in O
such O
awe O
of O
her O
intended O
son-in-law O
, O
that O
she O
ventured O
not O
to O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
unless O
it O
was O
in O
her O
power O
to O
offer O
him O
any O
attention O
, O
or O
mark O
her O
deference O
for O
his O
opinion O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
seeing O
her O
father O
taking O
pains O
to O
get O
acquainted O
with O
him O
; O
and O
Mr. O
Bennet O
soon O
assured O
her O
that O
he O
was O
rising O
every O
hour O
in O
his O
esteem O
. O
" O
I O
admire O
all O
my O
three O
sons-in-law O
highly O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
Wickham O
, O
perhaps O
, O
is O
my O
favourite O
; O
but O
I O
think O
I O
shall O
like O
_your_ O
husband O
quite O
as O
well O
as O
Jane O
's O
. O
