Elizabeth O
awoke O
the O
next O
morning O
to O
the O
same O
thoughts O
and O
meditations O
which O
had O
at O
length O
closed O
her O
eyes O
. O
She O
could O
not O
yet O
recover O
from O
the O
surprise O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
; O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
think O
of O
any O
thing O
else O
, O
and O
totally O
indisposed O
for O
employment O
, O
she O
resolved O
soon O
after O
breakfast O
to O
indulge O
herself O
in O
air O
and O
exercise O
. O
She O
was O
proceeding O
directly O
to O
her O
favourite O
walk O
, O
when O
the O
recollection O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
sometimes O
coming O
there O
stopped O
her O
, O
and O
instead O
of O
entering O
the O
park O
, O
she O
turned O
up O
the O
lane O
, O
which O
led O
her O
farther O
from O
the O
turnpike O
road O
. O
The O
park O
paling O
was O
still O
the O
boundary O
on O
one O
side O
, O
and O
she O
soon O
passed O
one O
of O
the O
gates O
into O
the O
ground O
. O
After O
walking O
two O
or O
three O
times O
along O
that O
part O
of O
the O
lane O
, O
she O
was O
tempted O
, O
by O
the O
pleasantness O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
to O
stop O
at O
the O
gates O
and O
look O
into O
the O
park O
. O
The O
five O
weeks O
which O
she O
had O
now O
passed O
in O
Kent O
, O
had O
made O
a O
great O
difference O
in O
the O
country O
, O
and O
every O
day O
was O
adding O
to O
the O
verdure O
of O
the O
early O
trees O
. O
She O
was O
on O
the O
point O
of O
continuing O
her O
walk O
, O
when O
she O
caught O
a O
glimpse O
of O
a O
gentleman O
within O
the O
sort O
of O
grove O
which O
edged O
the O
park O
; O
he O
was O
moving O
that O
way O
; O
and O
fearful O
of O
its O
being O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
, O
she O
was O
directly O
retreating O
. O
But O
the O
person O
who O
advanced O
, O
was O
now O
near O
enough O
to O
see O
her O
, O
and O
stepping O
forward O
with O
eagerness O
, O
pronounced O
her O
name O
. O
She O
had O
turned O
away O
, O
but O
on O
hearing O
herself O
called O
, O
though O
in O
a O
voice O
which O
proved O
it O
to O
be O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
she O
moved O
again O
towards O
the O
gate O
. O
He O
had O
by O
that O
time O
reached O
it O
also O
, O
and O
holding O
out O
a O
letter O
, O
which O
she O
instinctively O
took O
, O
said O
with O
a O
look O
of O
haughty O
composure O
, O
" O
I O
have O
been O
walking O
in O
the O
grove O
some O
time O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
meeting O
you O
. O
Will O
you O
do O
me O
the O
honour O
of O
reading O
that O
letter O
? O
" O
-- O
And O
then O
, O
with O
a O
slight O
bow O
, O
turned O
again O
into O
the O
plantation O
, O
and O
was O
soon O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
With O
no O
expectation O
of O
pleasure O
, O
but O
with O
the O
strongest O
curiosity O
, O
Elizabeth O
opened O
the O
letter O
, O
and O
to O
her O
still O
increasing O
wonder O
, O
perceived O
an O
envelope O
containing O
two O
sheets O
of O
letter O
paper O
, O
written O
quite O
through O
, O
in O
a O
very O
close O
hand. O
-- O
The O
envelope O
itself O
was O
likewise O
full. O
-- O
Pursuing O
her O
way O
along O
the O
lane O
, O
she O
then O
began O
it O
. O
It O
was O
dated O
from O
Rosings O
, O
at O
eight O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
was O
as O
follows O
: O
-- O
" O
Be O
not O
alarmed O
, O
Madam O
, O
on O
receiving O
this O
letter O
, O
by O
the O
apprehension O
of O
its O
containing O
any O
repetition O
of O
those O
sentiments O
, O
or O
renewal O
of O
those O
offers O
, O
which O
were O
last O
night O
so O
disgusting O
to O
you O
. O
I O
write O
without O
any O
intention O
of O
paining O
you O
, O
or O
humbling O
myself O
, O
by O
dwelling O
on O
wishes O
, O
which O
, O
for O
the O
happiness O
of O
both O
, O
can O
not O
be O
too O
soon O
forgotten O
; O
and O
the O
effort O
which O
the O
formation O
, O
and O
the O
perusal O
of O
this O
letter O
must O
occasion O
, O
should O
have O
been O
spared O
, O
had O
not O
my O
character O
required O
it O
to O
be O
written O
and O
read O
. O
You O
must O
, O
therefore O
, O
pardon O
the O
freedom O
with O
which O
I O
demand O
your O
attention O
; O
your O
feelings O
, O
I O
know O
, O
will O
bestow O
it O
unwillingly O
, O
but O
I O
demand O
it O
of O
your O
justice O
. O
" O
Two O
offences O
of O
a O
very O
different O
nature O
, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
of O
equal O
magnitude O
, O
you O
last O
night O
laid O
to O
my O
charge O
. O
The O
first O
mentioned O
was O
, O
that O
, O
regardless O
of O
the O
sentiments O
of O
either O
, O
I O
had O
detached O
Mr. O
Bingley O
from O
your O
sister O
, O
-- O
and O
the O
other O
, O
that O
I O
had O
, O
in O
defiance O
of O
various O
claims O
, O
in O
defiance O
of O
honour O
and O
humanity O
, O
ruined O
the O
immediate O
prosperity O
, O
and O
blasted O
the O
prospects O
of O
Mr O
. O
Wickham. O
-- O
Wilfully O
and O
wantonly O
to O
have O
thrown O
off O
the O
companion O
of O
my O
youth O
, O
the O
acknowledged O
favourite O
of O
my O
father O
, O
a O
young O
man O
who O
had O
scarcely O
any O
other O
dependence O
than O
on O
our O
patronage O
, O
and O
who O
had O
been O
brought O
up O
to O
expect O
its O
exertion O
, O
would O
be O
a O
depravity O
, O
to O
which O
the O
separation O
of O
two O
young O
persons O
, O
whose O
affection O
could O
be O
the O
growth O
of O
only O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
could O
bear O
no O
comparison. O
-- O
But O
from O
the O
severity O
of O
that O
blame O
which O
was O
last O
night O
so O
liberally O
bestowed O
, O
respecting O
each O
circumstance O
, O
I O
shall O
hope O
to O
be O
in O
future O
secured O
, O
when O
the O
following O
account O
of O
my O
actions O
and O
their O
motives O
has O
been O
read. O
-- O
If O
, O
in O
the O
explanation O
of O
them O
which O
is O
due O
to O
myself O
, O
I O
am O
under O
the O
necessity O
of O
relating O
feelings O
which O
may O
be O
offensive O
to O
your O
's O
, O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
I O
am O
sorry. O
-- O
The O
necessity O
must O
be O
obeyed O
-- O
and O
farther O
apology O
would O
be O
absurd. O
-- O
I O
had O
not O
been O
long O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
before O
I O
saw O
, O
in O
common O
with O
others O
, O
that O
Bingley O
preferred O
your O
eldest O
sister O
, O
to O
any O
other O
young O
woman O
in O
the O
country. O
-- O
But O
it O
was O
not O
till O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
dance O
at O
Netherfield O
that O
I O
had O
any O
apprehension O
of O
his O
feeling O
a O
serious O
attachment. O
-- O
I O
had O
often O
seen O
him O
in O
love O
before. O
-- O
At O
that O
ball O
, O
while O
I O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
dancing O
with O
you O
, O
I O
was O
first O
made O
acquainted O
, O
by O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
's O
accidental O
information O
, O
that O
Bingley O
's O
attentions O
to O
your O
sister O
had O
given O
rise O
to O
a O
general O
expectation O
of O
their O
marriage O
. O
He O
spoke O
of O
it O
as O
a O
certain O
event O
, O
of O
which O
the O
time O
alone O
could O
be O
undecided O
. O
From O
that O
moment O
I O
observed O
my O
friend O
's O
behaviour O
attentively O
; O
and O
I O
could O
then O
perceive O
that O
his O
partiality O
for O
Miss O
Bennet O
was O
beyond O
what O
I O
had O
ever O
witnessed O
in O
him O
. O
Your O
sister O
I O
also O
watched. O
-- O
Her O
look O
and O
manners O
were O
open O
, O
cheerful O
and O
engaging O
as O
ever O
, O
but O
without O
any O
symptom O
of O
peculiar O
regard O
, O
and O
I O
remained O
convinced O
from O
the O
evening O
's O
scrutiny O
, O
that O
though O
she O
received O
his O
attentions O
with O
pleasure O
, O
she O
did O
not O
invite O
them O
by O
any O
participation O
of O
sentiment. O
-- O
If O
_you_ O
have O
not O
been O
mistaken O
here O
, O
_I_ O
must O
have O
been O
in O
an O
error O
. O
Your O
superior O
knowledge O
of O
your O
sister O
must O
make O
the O
latter O
probable. O
-- O
If O
it O
be O
so O
, O
if O
I O
have O
been O
misled O
by O
such O
error O
, O
to O
inflict O
pain O
on O
her O
, O
your O
resentment O
has O
not O
been O
unreasonable O
. O
But O
I O
shall O
not O
scruple O
to O
assert O
, O
that O
the O
serenity O
of O
your O
sister O
's O
countenance O
and O
air O
was O
such O
, O
as O
might O
have O
given O
the O
most O
acute O
observer O
, O
a O
conviction O
that O
, O
however O
amiable O
her O
temper O
, O
her O
heart O
was O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
easily O
touched. O
-- O
That O
I O
was O
desirous O
of O
believing O
her O
indifferent O
is O
certain O
, O
-- O
but O
I O
will O
venture O
to O
say O
that O
my O
investigations O
and O
decisions O
are O
not O
usually O
influenced O
by O
my O
hopes O
or O
fears. O
-- O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
her O
to O
be O
indifferent O
because O
I O
wished O
it O
; O
-- O
I O
believed O
it O
on O
impartial O
conviction O
, O
as O
truly O
as O
I O
wished O
it O
in O
reason. O
-- O
My O
objections O
to O
the O
marriage O
were O
not O
merely O
those O
, O
which O
I O
last O
night O
acknowledged O
to O
have O
required O
the O
utmost O
force O
of O
passion O
to O
put O
aside O
, O
in O
my O
own O
case O
; O
the O
want O
of O
connection O
could O
not O
be O
so O
great O
an O
evil O
to O
my O
friend O
as O
to O
me. O
-- O
But O
there O
were O
other O
causes O
of O
repugnance O
; O
-- O
causes O
which O
, O
though O
still O
existing O
, O
and O
existing O
to O
an O
equal O
degree O
in O
both O
instances O
, O
I O
had O
myself O
endeavoured O
to O
forget O
, O
because O
they O
were O
not O
immediately O
before O
me. O
-- O
These O
causes O
must O
be O
stated O
, O
though O
briefly. O
-- O
The O
situation O
of O
your O
mother O
's O
family O
, O
though O
objectionable O
, O
was O
nothing O
in O
comparison O
of O
that O
total O
want O
of O
propriety O
so O
frequently O
, O
so O
almost O
uniformly O
betrayed O
by O
herself O
, O
by O
your O
three O
younger O
sisters O
, O
and O
occasionally O
even O
by O
your O
father. O
-- O
Pardon O
me. O
-- O
It O
pains O
me O
to O
offend O
you O
. O
But O
amidst O
your O
concern O
for O
the O
defects O
of O
your O
nearest O
relations O
, O
and O
your O
displeasure O
at O
this O
representation O
of O
them O
, O
let O
it O
give O
you O
consolation O
to O
consider O
that O
, O
to O
have O
conducted O
yourselves O
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
any O
share O
of O
the O
like O
censure O
, O
is O
praise O
no O
less O
generally O
bestowed O
on O
you O
and O
your O
eldest O
sister O
, O
than O
it O
is O
honourable O
to O
the O
sense O
and O
disposition O
of O
both. O
-- O
I O
will O
only O
say O
farther O
, O
that O
from O
what O
passed O
that O
evening O
, O
my O
opinion O
of O
all O
parties O
was O
confirmed O
, O
and O
every O
inducement O
heightened O
, O
which O
could O
have O
led O
me O
before O
, O
to O
preserve O
my O
friend O
from O
what O
I O
esteemed O
a O
most O
unhappy O
connection. O
-- O
He O
left O
Netherfield O
for O
London O
, O
on O
the O
day O
following O
, O
as O
you O
, O
I O
am O
certain O
, O
remember O
, O
with O
the O
design O
of O
soon O
returning. O
-- O
The O
part O
which O
I O
acted O
, O
is O
now O
to O
be O
explained. O
-- O
His O
sisters O
' O
uneasiness O
had O
been O
equally O
excited O
with O
my O
own O
; O
our O
coincidence O
of O
feeling O
was O
soon O
discovered O
; O
and O
, O
alike O
sensible O
that O
no O
time O
was O
to O
be O
lost O
in O
detaching O
their O
brother O
, O
we O
shortly O
resolved O
on O
joining O
him O
directly O
in O
London. O
-- O
We O
accordingly O
went O
-- O
and O
there O
I O
readily O
engaged O
in O
the O
office O
of O
pointing O
out O
to O
my O
friend O
, O
the O
certain O
evils O
of O
such O
a O
choice. O
-- O
I O
described O
, O
and O
enforced O
them O
earnestly. O
-- O
But O
, O
however O
this O
remonstrance O
might O
have O
staggered O
or O
delayed O
his O
determination O
, O
I O
do O
not O
suppose O
that O
it O
would O
ultimately O
have O
prevented O
the O
marriage O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
seconded O
by O
the O
assurance O
which O
I O
hesitated O
not O
in O
giving O
, O
of O
your O
sister O
's O
indifference O
. O
He O
had O
before O
believed O
her O
to O
return O
his O
affection O
with O
sincere O
, O
if O
not O
with O
equal O
regard. O
-- O
But O
Bingley O
has O
great O
natural O
modesty O
, O
with O
a O
stronger O
dependence O
on O
my O
judgment O
than O
on O
his O
own. O
-- O
To O
convince O
him O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
he O
had O
deceived O
himself O
, O
was O
no O
very O
difficult O
point O
. O
To O
persuade O
him O
against O
returning O
into O
Hertfordshire O
, O
when O
that O
conviction O
had O
been O
given O
, O
was O
scarcely O
the O
work O
of O
a O
moment. O
-- O
I O
can O
not O
blame O
myself O
for O
having O
done O
thus O
much O
. O
There O
is O
but O
one O
part O
of O
my O
conduct O
in O
the O
whole O
affair O
, O
on O
which O
I O
do O
not O
reflect O
with O
satisfaction O
; O
it O
is O
that O
I O
condescended O
to O
adopt O
the O
measures O
of O
art O
so O
far O
as O
to O
conceal O
from O
him O
your O
sister O
's O
being O
in O
town O
. O
I O
knew O
it O
myself O
, O
as O
it O
was O
known O
to O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
but O
her O
brother O
is O
even O
yet O
ignorant O
of O
it. O
-- O
That O
they O
might O
have O
met O
without O
ill O
consequence O
, O
is O
perhaps O
probable O
; O
-- O
but O
his O
regard O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
me O
enough O
extinguished O
for O
him O
to O
see O
her O
without O
some O
danger. O
-- O
Perhaps O
this O
concealment O
, O
this O
disguise O
, O
was O
beneath O
me. O
-- O
It O
is O
done O
, O
however O
, O
and O
it O
was O
done O
for O
the O
best. O
-- O
On O
this O
subject O
I O
have O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
, O
no O
other O
apology O
to O
offer O
. O
If O
I O
have O
wounded O
your O
sister O
's O
feelings O
, O
it O
was O
unknowingly O
done O
; O
and O
though O
the O
motives O
which O
governed O
me O
may O
to O
you O
very O
naturally O
appear O
insufficient O
, O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
learnt O
to O
condemn O
them. O
-- O
With O
respect O
to O
that O
other O
, O
more O
weighty O
accusation O
, O
of O
having O
injured O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
I O
can O
only O
refute O
it O
by O
laying O
before O
you O
the O
whole O
of O
his O
connection O
with O
my O
family O
. O
Of O
what O
he O
has O
_particularly_ O
accused O
me O
I O
am O
ignorant O
; O
but O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
I O
shall O
relate O
, O
I O
can O
summon O
more O
than O
one O
witness O
of O
undoubted O

Mr. O
Wickham O
is O
the O
son O
of O
a O
very O
respectable O
man O
, O
who O
had O
for O
many O
years O
the O
management O
of O
all O
the O
Pemberley O
estates O
; O
and O
whose O
good O
conduct O
in O
the O
discharge O
of O
his O
trust O
, O
naturally O
inclined O
my O
father O
to O
be O
of O
service O
to O
him O
, O
and O
on O
George O
Wickham O
, O
who O
was O
his O
god-son O
, O
his O
kindness O
was O
therefore O
liberally O
bestowed O
. O
My O
father O
supported O
him O
at O
school O
, O
and O
afterwards O
at O
Cambridge O
; O
-- O
most O
important O
assistance O
, O
as O
his O
own O
father O
, O
always O
poor O
from O
the O
extravagance O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
would O
have O
been O
unable O
to O
give O
him O
a O
gentleman O
's O
education O
. O
My O
father O
was O
not O
only O
fond O
of O
this O
young O
man O
's O
society O
, O
whose O
manners O
were O
always O
engaging O
; O
he O
had O
also O
the O
highest O
opinion O
of O
him O
, O
and O
hoping O
the O
church O
would O
be O
his O
profession O
, O
intended O
to O
provide O
for O
him O
in O
it O
. O
As O
for O
myself O
, O
it O
is O
many O
, O
many O
years O
since O
I O
first O
began O
to O
think O
of O
him O
in O
a O
very O
different O
manner O
. O
The O
vicious O
propensities O
-- O
the O
want O
of O
principle O
which O
he O
was O
careful O
to O
guard O
from O
the O
knowledge O
of O
his O
best O
friend O
, O
could O
not O
escape O
the O
observation O
of O
a O
young O
man O
of O
nearly O
the O
same O
age O
with O
himself O
, O
and O
who O
had O
opportunities O
of O
seeing O
him O
in O
unguarded O
moments O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Darcy O
could O
not O
have O
. O
Here O
again O
I O
shall O
give O
you O
pain O
-- O
to O
what O
degree O
you O
only O
can O
tell O
. O
But O
whatever O
may O
be O
the O
sentiments O
which O
Mr. O
Wickham O
has O
created O
, O
a O
suspicion O
of O
their O
nature O
shall O
not O
prevent O
me O
from O
unfolding O
his O
real O
character O
. O
It O
adds O
even O
another O
motive O
. O
My O
excellent O
father O
died O
about O
five O
years O
ago O
; O
and O
his O
attachment O
to O
Mr. O
Wickham O
was O
to O
the O
last O
so O
steady O
, O
that O
in O
his O
will O
he O
particularly O
recommended O
it O
to O
me O
, O
to O
promote O
his O
advancement O
in O
the O
best O
manner O
that O
his O
profession O
might O
allow O
, O
and O
if O
he O
took O
orders O
, O
desired O
that O
a O
valuable O
family O
living O
might O
be O
his O
as O
soon O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
became O
vacant O
. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
legacy O
of O
one O
thousand O
pounds O
. O
His O
own O
father O
did O
not O
long O
survive O
mine O
, O
and O
within O
half O
a O
year O
from O
these O
events O
, O
Mr. O
Wickham O
wrote O
to O
inform O
me O
that O
, O
having O
finally O
resolved O
against O
taking O
orders O
, O
he O
hoped O
I O
should O
not O
think O
it O
unreasonable O
for O
him O
to O
expect O
some O
more O
immediate O
pecuniary O
advantage O
, O
in O
lieu O
of O
the O
preferment O
, O
by O
which O
he O
could O
not O
be O
benefited O
. O
He O
had O
some O
intention O
, O
he O
added O
, O
of O
studying O
the O
law O
, O
and O
I O
must O
be O
aware O
that O
the O
interest O
of O
one O
thousand O
pounds O
would O
be O
a O
very O
insufficient O
support O
therein O
. O
I O
rather O
wished O
, O
than O
believed O
him O
to O
be O
sincere O
; O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
was O
perfectly O
ready O
to O
accede O
to O
his O
proposal O
. O
I O
knew O
that O
Mr. O
Wickham O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
a O
clergyman O
. O
The O
business O
was O
therefore O
soon O
settled O
. O
He O
resigned O
all O
claim O
to O
assistance O
in O
the O
church O
, O
were O
it O
possible O
that O
he O
could O
ever O
be O
in O
a O
situation O
to O
receive O
it O
, O
and O
accepted O
in O
return O
three O
thousand O
pounds O
. O
All O
connection O
between O
us O
seemed O
now O
dissolved O
. O
I O
thought O
too O
ill O
of O
him O
, O
to O
invite O
him O
to O
Pemberley O
, O
or O
admit O
his O
society O
in O
town O
. O
In O
town O
I O
believe O
he O
chiefly O
lived O
, O
but O
his O
studying O
the O
law O
was O
a O
mere O
pretence O
, O
and O
being O
now O
free O
from O
all O
restraint O
, O
his O
life O
was O
a O
life O
of O
idleness O
and O
dissipation O
. O
For O
about O
three O
years O
I O
heard O
little O
of O
him O
; O
but O
on O
the O
decease O
of O
the O
incumbent O
of O
the O
living O
which O
had O
been O
designed O
for O
him O
, O
he O
applied O
to O
me O
again O
by O
letter O
for O
the O
presentation O
. O
His O
circumstances O
, O
he O
assured O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
no O
difficulty O
in O
believing O
it O
, O
were O
exceedingly O
bad O
. O
He O
had O
found O
the O
law O
a O
most O
unprofitable O
study O
, O
and O
was O
now O
absolutely O
resolved O
on O
being O
ordained O
, O
if O
I O
would O
present O
him O
to O
the O
living O
in O
question O
-- O
of O
which O
he O
trusted O
there O
could O
be O
little O
doubt O
, O
as O
he O
was O
well O
assured O
that O
I O
had O
no O
other O
person O
to O
provide O
for O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
have O
forgotten O
my O
revered O
father O
's O
intentions O
. O
You O
will O
hardly O
blame O
me O
for O
refusing O
to O
comply O
with O
this O
entreaty O
, O
or O
for O
resisting O
every O
repetition O
of O
it O
. O
His O
resentment O
was O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
distress O
of O
his O
circumstances O
-- O
and O
he O
was O
doubtless O
as O
violent O
in O
his O
abuse O
of O
me O
to O
others O
, O
as O
in O
his O
reproaches O
to O
myself O
. O
After O
this O
period O
, O
every O
appearance O
of O
acquaintance O
was O
dropt O
. O
How O
he O
lived O
I O
know O
not O
. O
But O
last O
summer O
he O
was O
again O
most O
painfully O
obtruded O
on O
my O
notice O
. O
I O
must O
now O
mention O
a O
circumstance O
which O
I O
would O
wish O
to O
forget O
myself O
, O
and O
which O
no O
obligation O
less O
than O
the O
present O
should O
induce O
me O
to O
unfold O
to O
any O
human O
being O
. O
Having O
said O
thus O
much O
, O
I O
feel O
no O
doubt O
of O
your O
secrecy O
. O
My O
sister O
, O
who O
is O
more O
than O
ten O
years O
my O
junior O
, O
was O
left O
to O
the O
guardianship O
of O
my O
mother O
's O
nephew O
, O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
and O
myself O
. O
About O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
she O
was O
taken O
from O
school O
, O
and O
an O
establishment O
formed O
for O
her O
in O
London O
; O
and O
last O
summer O
she O
went O
with O
the O
lady O
who O
presided O
over O
it O
, O
to O
Ramsgate O
; O
and O
thither O
also O
went O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
undoubtedly O
by O
design O
; O
for O
there O
proved O
to O
have O
been O
a O
prior O
acquaintance O
between O
him O
and O
Mrs O
. O
Younge O
, O
in O
whose O
character O
we O
were O
most O
unhappily O
deceived O
; O
and O
by O
her O
connivance O
and O
aid O
, O
he O
so O
far O
recommended O
himself O
to O
Georgiana O
, O
whose O
affectionate O
heart O
retained O
a O
strong O
impression O
of O
his O
kindness O
to O
her O
as O
a O
child O
, O
that O
she O
was O
persuaded O
to O
believe O
herself O
in O
love O
, O
and O
to O
consent O
to O
an O
elopement O
. O
She O
was O
then O
but O
fifteen O
, O
which O
must O
be O
her O
excuse O
; O
and O
after O
stating O
her O
imprudence O
, O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
add O
, O
that O
I O
owed O
the O
knowledge O
of O
it O
to O
herself O
. O
I O
joined O
them O
unexpectedly O
a O
day O
or O
two O
before O
the O
intended O
elopement O
, O
and O
then O
Georgiana O
, O
unable O
to O
support O
the O
idea O
of O
grieving O
and O
offending O
a O
brother O
whom O
she O
almost O
looked O
up O
to O
as O
a O
father O
, O
acknowledged O
the O
whole O
to O
me O
. O
You O
may O
imagine O
what O
I O
felt O
and O
how O
I O
acted O
. O
Regard O
for O
my O
sister O
's O
credit O
and O
feelings O
prevented O
any O
public O
exposure O
, O
but O
I O
wrote O
to O
Mr. O
Wickham O
, O
who O
left O
the O
place O
immediately O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Younge O
was O
of O
course O
removed O
from O
her O
charge O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
chief O
object O
was O
unquestionably O
my O
sister O
's O
fortune O
, O
which O
is O
thirty O
thousand O
pounds O
; O
but O
I O
can O
not O
help O
supposing O
that O
the O
hope O
of O
revenging O
himself O
on O
me O
, O
was O
a O
strong O
inducement O
. O
His O
revenge O
would O
have O
been O
complete O
indeed O
. O
This O
, O
madam O
, O
is O
a O
faithful O
narrative O
of O
every O
event O
in O
which O
we O
have O
been O
concerned O
together O
; O
and O
if O
you O
do O
not O
absolutely O
reject O
it O
as O
false O
, O
you O
will O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
acquit O
me O
henceforth O
of O
cruelty O
towards O
Mr. O
Wickham O
. O
I O
know O
not O
in O
what O
manner O
, O
under O
what O
form O
of O
falsehood O
he O
has O
imposed O
on O
you O
; O
but O
his O
success O
is O
not O
perhaps O
to O
be O
wondered O
at O
. O
Ignorant O
as O
you O
previously O
were O
of O
every O
thing O
concerning O
either O
, O
detection O
could O
not O
be O
in O
your O
power O
, O
and O
suspicion O
certainly O
not O
in O
your O
inclination O
. O
You O
may O
possibly O
wonder O
why O
all O
this O
was O
not O
told O
you O
last O
night O
. O
But O
I O
was O
not O
then O
master O
enough O
of O
myself O
to O
know O
what O
could O
or O
ought O
to O
be O
revealed O
. O
For O
the O
truth O
of O
every O
thing O
here O
related O
, O
I O
can O
appeal O
more O
particularly O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
who O
from O
our O
near O
relationship O
and O
constant O
intimacy O
, O
and O
still O
more O
as O
one O
of O
the O
executors O
of O
my O
father O
's O
will O
, O
has O
been O
unavoidably O
acquainted O
with O
every O
particular O
of O
these O
transactions O
. O
If O
your O
abhorrence O
of O
_me_ O
should O
make O
_my_ O
assertions O
valueless O
, O
you O
can O
not O
be O
prevented O
by O
the O
same O
cause O
from O
confiding O
in O
my O
cousin O
; O
and O
that O
there O
may O
be O
the O
possibility O
of O
consulting O
him O
, O
I O
shall O
endeavour O
to O
find O
some O
opportunity O
of O
putting O
this O
letter O
in O
your O
hands O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
morning O
. O
I O
will O
only O
add O
, O
God O
bless O
you O
