Instead O
of O
receiving O
any O
such O
letter O
of O
excuse O
from O
his O
friend O
, O
as O
Elizabeth O
half O
expected O
Mr. O
Bingley O
to O
do O
, O
he O
was O
able O
to O
bring O
Darcy O
with O
him O
to O
Longbourn O
before O
many O
days O
had O
passed O
after O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
visit O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
arrived O
early O
; O
and O
, O
before O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
time O
to O
tell O
him O
of O
their O
having O
seen O
his O
aunt O
, O
of O
which O
her O
daughter O
sat O
in O
momentary O
dread O
, O
Bingley O
, O
who O
wanted O
to O
be O
alone O
with O
Jane O
, O
proposed O
their O
all O
walking O
out O
. O
It O
was O
agreed O
to O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
not O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
walking O
, O
Mary O
could O
never O
spare O
time O
, O
but O
the O
remaining O
five O
set O
off O
together O
. O
Bingley O
and O
Jane O
, O
however O
, O
soon O
allowed O
the O
others O
to O
outstrip O
them O
. O
They O
lagged O
behind O
, O
while O
Elizabeth O
, O
Kitty O
, O
and O
Darcy O
, O
were O
to O
entertain O
each O
other O
. O
Very O
little O
was O
said O
by O
either O
; O
Kitty O
was O
too O
much O
afraid O
of O
him O
to O
talk O
; O
Elizabeth O
was O
secretly O
forming O
a O
desperate O
resolution O
; O
and O
perhaps O
he O
might O
be O
doing O
the O
same O
. O
They O
walked O
towards O
the O
Lucases O
, O
because O
Kitty O
wished O
to O
call O
upon O
Maria O
; O
and O
as O
Elizabeth O
saw O
no O
occasion O
for O
making O
it O
a O
general O
concern O
, O
when O
Kitty O
left O
them O
, O
she O
went O
boldly O
on O
with O
him O
alone O
. O
Now O
was O
the O
moment O
for O
her O
resolution O
to O
be O
executed O
, O
and O
, O
while O
her O
courage O
was O
high O
, O
she O
immediately O
said O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
I O
am O
a O
very O
selfish O
creature O
; O
and O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
giving O
relief O
to O
my O
own O
feelings O
, O
care O
not O
how O
much O
I O
may O
be O
wounding O
your O
's O
. O
I O
can O
no O
longer O
help O
thanking O
you O
for O
your O
unexampled O
kindness O
to O
my O
poor O
sister O
. O
Ever O
since O
I O
have O
known O
it O
, O
I O
have O
been O
most O
anxious O
to O
acknowledge O
to O
you O
how O
gratefully O
I O
feel O
it O
. O
Were O
it O
known O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
family O
, O
I O
should O
not O
have O
merely O
my O
own O
gratitude O
to O
express O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
sorry O
, O
exceedingly O
sorry O
, O
" O
replied O
Darcy O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
of O
surprise O
and O
emotion O
, O
" O
that O
you O
have O
ever O
been O
informed O
of O
what O
may O
, O
in O
a O
mistaken O
light O
, O
have O
given O
you O
uneasiness O
. O
I O
did O
not O
think O
Mrs O
. O
Gardiner O
was O
so O
little O
to O
be O
trusted O
. O
" O
" O
You O
must O
not O
blame O
my O
aunt O
. O
Lydia O
's O
thoughtlessness O
first O
betrayed O
to O
me O
that O
you O
had O
been O
concerned O
in O
the O
matter O
; O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
I O
could O
not O
rest O
till O
I O
knew O
the O
particulars O
. O
Let O
me O
thank O
you O
again O
and O
again O
, O
in O
the O
name O
of O
all O
my O
family O
, O
for O
that O
generous O
compassion O
which O
induced O
you O
to O
take O
so O
much O
trouble O
, O
and O
bear O
so O
many O
mortifications O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
discovering O
them O
. O
" O
" O
If O
you O
_will_ O
thank O
me O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
let O
it O
be O
for O
yourself O
alone O
. O
That O
the O
wish O
of O
giving O
happiness O
to O
you O
, O
might O
add O
force O
to O
the O
other O
inducements O
which O
led O
me O
on O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
attempt O
to O
deny O
. O
But O
your O
_family_ O
owe O
me O
nothing O
. O
Much O
as O
I O
respect O
them O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
I O
thought O
only O
of O
_you_ O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
too O
much O
embarrassed O
to O
say O
a O
word O
. O
After O
a O
short O
pause O
, O
her O
companion O
added O
, O
" O
You O
are O
too O
generous O
to O
trifle O
with O
me O
. O
If O
your O
feelings O
are O
still O
what O
they O
were O
last O
April O
, O
tell O
me O
so O
at O
once O
. O
_My_ O
affections O
and O
wishes O
are O
unchanged O
, O
but O
one O
word O
from O
you O
will O
silence O
me O
on O
this O
subject O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
feeling O
all O
the O
more O
than O
common O
awkwardness O
and O
anxiety O
of O
his O
situation O
, O
now O
forced O
herself O
to O
speak O
; O
and O
immediately O
, O
though O
not O
very O
fluently O
, O
gave O
him O
to O
understand O
, O
that O
her O
sentiments O
had O
undergone O
so O
material O
a O
change O
, O
since O
the O
period O
to O
which O
he O
alluded O
, O
as O
to O
make O
her O
receive O
with O
gratitude O
and O
pleasure O
, O
his O
present O
assurances O
. O
The O
happiness O
which O
this O
reply O
produced O
, O
was O
such O
as O
he O
had O
probably O
never O
felt O
before O
; O
and O
he O
expressed O
himself O
on O
the O
occasion O
as O
sensibly O
and O
as O
warmly O
as O
a O
man O
violently O
in O
love O
can O
be O
supposed O
to O
do O
. O
Had O
Elizabeth O
been O
able O
to O
encounter O
his O
eye O
, O
she O
might O
have O
seen O
how O
well O
the O
expression O
of O
heart-felt O
delight O
, O
diffused O
over O
his O
face O
, O
became O
him O
; O
but O
, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
look O
, O
she O
could O
listen O
, O
and O
he O
told O
her O
of O
feelings O
, O
which O
, O
in O
proving O
of O
what O
importance O
she O
was O
to O
him O
, O
made O
his O
affection O
every O
moment O
more O
valuable O
. O
They O
walked O
on O
, O
without O
knowing O
in O
what O
direction O
. O
There O
was O
too O
much O
to O
be O
thought O
; O
and O
felt O
, O
and O
said O
, O
for O
attention O
to O
any O
other O
objects O
. O
She O
soon O
learnt O
that O
they O
were O
indebted O
for O
their O
present O
good O
understanding O
to O
the O
efforts O
of O
his O
aunt O
, O
who O
_did_ O
call O
on O
him O
in O
her O
return O
through O
London O
, O
and O
there O
relate O
her O
journey O
to O
Longbourn O
, O
its O
motive O
, O
and O
the O
substance O
of O
her O
conversation O
with O
Elizabeth O
; O
dwelling O
emphatically O
on O
every O
expression O
of O
the O
latter O
, O
which O
, O
in O
her O
ladyship O
's O
apprehension O
, O
peculiarly O
denoted O
her O
perverseness O
and O
assurance O
, O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
such O
a O
relation O
must O
assist O
her O
endeavours O
to O
obtain O
that O
promise O
from O
her O
nephew O
, O
which O
_she_ O
had O
refused O
to O
give O
. O
But O
, O
unluckily O
for O
her O
ladyship O
, O
its O
effect O
had O
been O
exactly O
contrariwise O
. O
" O
It O
taught O
me O
to O
hope O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
as O
I O
had O
scarcely O
ever O
allowed O
myself O
to O
hope O
before O
. O
I O
knew O
enough O
of O
your O
disposition O
to O
be O
certain O
, O
that O
, O
had O
you O
been O
absolutely O
, O
irrevocably O
decided O
against O
me O
, O
you O
would O
have O
acknowledged O
it O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
frankly O
and O
openly O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
coloured O
and O
laughed O
as O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
Yes O
, O
you O
know O
enough O
of O
my O
_frankness_ O
to O
believe O
me O
capable O
of O
_that_ O
. O
After O
abusing O
you O
so O
abominably O
to O
your O
face O
, O
I O
could O
have O
no O
scruple O
in O
abusing O
you O
to O
all O
your O
relations O
. O
" O
" O
What O
did O
you O
say O
of O
me O
, O
that O
I O
did O
not O
deserve O
? O
For O
, O
though O
your O
accusations O
were O
ill-founded O
, O
formed O
on O
mistaken O
premises O
, O
my O
behaviour O
to O
you O
at O
the O
time O
, O
had O
merited O
the O
severest O
reproof O
. O
It O
was O
unpardonable O
. O
I O
can O
not O
think O
of O
it O
without O
abhorrence O
. O
" O
" O
We O
will O
not O
quarrel O
for O
the O
greater O
share O
of O
blame O
annexed O
to O
that O
evening O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
The O
conduct O
of O
neither O
, O
if O
strictly O
examined O
, O
will O
be O
irreproachable O
; O
but O
since O
then O
, O
we O
have O
both O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
improved O
in O
civility O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
be O
so O
easily O
reconciled O
to O
myself O
. O
The O
recollection O
of O
what O
I O
then O
said O
, O
of O
my O
conduct O
, O
my O
manners O
, O
my O
expressions O
during O
the O
whole O
of O
it O
, O
is O
now O
, O
and O
has O
been O
many O
months O
, O
inexpressibly O
painful O
to O
me O
. O
Your O
reproof O
, O
so O
well O
applied O
, O
I O
shall O
never O
forget O
: O
'had O
you O
behaved O
in O
a O
more O
gentleman-like O
manner O
. O
' O
Those O
were O
your O
words O
. O
You O
know O
not O
, O
you O
can O
scarcely O
conceive O
, O
how O
they O
have O
tortured O
me O
; O
-- O
though O
it O
was O
some O
time O
, O
I O
confess O
, O
before O
I O
was O
reasonable O
enough O
to O
allow O
their O
justice O
. O
" O
" O
I O
was O
certainly O
very O
far O
from O
expecting O
them O
to O
make O
so O
strong O
an O
impression O
. O
I O
had O
not O
the O
smallest O
idea O
of O
their O
being O
ever O
felt O
in O
such O
a O
way O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
easily O
believe O
it O
. O
You O
thought O
me O
then O
devoid O
of O
every O
proper O
feeling O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
did O
. O
The O
turn O
of O
your O
countenance O
I O
shall O
never O
forget O
, O
as O
you O
said O
that O
I O
could O
not O
have O
addressed O
you O
in O
any O
possible O
way O
, O
that O
would O
induce O
you O
to O
accept O
me O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
do O
not O
repeat O
what O
I O
then O
said O
. O
These O
recollections O
will O
not O
do O
at O
all O
. O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
that O
I O
have O
long O
been O
most O
heartily O
ashamed O
of O
it O
. O
" O
Darcy O
mentioned O
his O
letter O
. O
" O
Did O
it O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
did O
it O
_soon_ O
make O
you O
think O
better O
of O
me O
? O
Did O
you O
, O
on O
reading O
it O
, O
give O
any O
credit O
to O
its O
contents O
? O
" O
She O
explained O
what O
its O
effect O
on O
her O
had O
been O
, O
and O
how O
gradually O
all O
her O
former O
prejudices O
had O
been O
removed O
. O
" O
I O
knew O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
that O
what O
I O
wrote O
must O
give O
you O
pain O
, O
but O
it O
was O
necessary O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
have O
destroyed O
the O
letter O
. O
There O
was O
one O
part O
especially O
, O
the O
opening O
of O
it O
, O
which O
I O
should O
dread O
your O
having O
the O
power O
of O
reading O
again O
. O
I O
can O
remember O
some O
expressions O
which O
might O
justly O
make O
you O
hate O
me O
. O
" O
" O
The O
letter O
shall O
certainly O
be O
burnt O
, O
if O
you O
believe O
it O
essential O
to O
the O
preservation O
of O
my O
regard O
; O
but O
, O
though O
we O
have O
both O
reason O
to O
think O
my O
opinions O
not O
entirely O
unalterable O
, O
they O
are O
not O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
quite O
so O
easily O
changed O
as O
that O
implies O
. O
" O
" O
When O
I O
wrote O
that O
letter O
, O
" O
replied O
Darcy O
, O
" O
I O
believed O
myself O
perfectly O
calm O
and O
cool O
, O
but O
I O
am O
since O
convinced O
that O
it O
was O
written O
in O
a O
dreadful O
bitterness O
of O
spirit O
. O
" O
" O
The O
letter O
, O
perhaps O
, O
began O
in O
bitterness O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
end O
so O
. O
The O
adieu O
is O
charity O
itself O
. O
But O
think O
no O
more O
of O
the O
letter O
. O
The O
feelings O
of O
the O
person O
who O
wrote O
, O
and O
the O
person O
who O
received O
it O
, O
are O
now O
so O
widely O
different O
from O
what O
they O
were O
then O
, O
that O
every O
unpleasant O
circumstance O
attending O
it O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
forgotten O
. O
You O
must O
learn O
some O
of O
my O
philosophy O
. O
Think O
only O
of O
the O
past O
as O
its O
remembrance O
gives O
you O
pleasure O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
give O
you O
credit O
for O
any O
philosophy O
of O
the O
kind O
. O
_Your_ O
retrospections O
must O
be O
so O
totally O
void O
of O
reproach O
, O
that O
the O
contentment O
arising O
from O
them O
, O
is O
not O
of O
philosophy O
, O
but O
what O
is O
much O
better O
, O
of O
ignorance O
. O
But O
with O
_me_ O
, O
it O
is O
not O
so O
. O
Painful O
recollections O
will O
intrude O
, O
which O
can O
not O
, O
which O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
repelled O
. O
I O
have O
been O
a O
selfish O
being O
all O
my O
life O
, O
in O
practice O
, O
though O
not O
in O
principle O
. O
As O
a O
child O
I O
was O
taught O
what O
was O
_right_ O
, O
but O
I O
was O
not O
taught O
to O
correct O
my O
temper O
. O
I O
was O
given O
good O
principles O
, O
but O
left O
to O
follow O
them O
in O
pride O
and O
conceit O
. O
Unfortunately O
an O
only O
son O
, O
( O
for O
many O
years O
an O
only O
_child_ O
) O
I O
was O
spoilt O
by O
my O
parents O
, O
who O
though O
good O
themselves O
, O
( O
my O
father O
particularly O
, O
all O
that O
was O
benevolent O
and O
amiable O
, O
) O
allowed O
, O
encouraged O
, O
almost O
taught O
me O
to O
be O
selfish O
and O
overbearing O
, O
to O
care O
for O
none O
beyond O
my O
own O
family O
circle O
, O
to O
think O
meanly O
of O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
, O
to O
_wish_ O
at O
least O
to O
think O
meanly O
of O
their O
sense O
and O
worth O
compared O
with O
my O
own O
. O
Such O
I O
was O
, O
from O
eight O
to O
eight O
and O
twenty O
; O
and O
such O
I O
might O
still O
have O
been O
but O
for O
you O
, O
dearest O
, O
loveliest O
Elizabeth O
! O
What O
do O
I O
not O
owe O
you O
! O
You O
taught O
me O
a O
lesson O
, O
hard O
indeed O
at O
first O
, O
but O
most O
advantageous O
. O
By O
you O
, O
I O
was O
properly O
humbled O
. O
I O
came O
to O
you O
without O
a O
doubt O
of O
my O
reception O
. O
You O
shewed O
me O
how O
insufficient O
were O
all O
my O
pretensions O
to O
please O
a O
woman O
worthy O
of O
being O
pleased O
. O
" O
" O
Had O
you O
then O
persuaded O
yourself O
that O
I O
should O
? O
" O
" O
Indeed O
I O
had O
. O
What O
will O
you O
think O
of O
my O
vanity O
? O
I O
believed O
you O
to O
be O
wishing O
, O
expecting O
my O
addresses O
. O
" O
" O
My O
manners O
must O
have O
been O
in O
fault O
, O
but O
not O
intentionally O
I O
assure O
you O
. O
I O
never O
meant O
to O
deceive O
you O
, O
but O
my O
spirits O
might O
often O
lead O
me O
wrong O
. O
How O
you O
must O
have O
hated O
me O
after O
_that_ O
evening O
? O
" O
" O
Hate O
you O
! O
I O
was O
angry O
perhaps O
at O
first O
, O
but O
my O
anger O
soon O
began O
to O
take O
a O
proper O
direction O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
almost O
afraid O
of O
asking O
what O
you O
thought O
of O
me O
; O
when O
we O
met O
at O
Pemberley O
. O
You O
blamed O
me O
for O
coming O
? O
" O
" O
No O
indeed O
; O
I O
felt O
nothing O
but O
surprise O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
surprise O
could O
not O
be O
greater O
than O
_mine_ O
in O
being O
noticed O
by O
you O
. O
My O
conscience O
told O
me O
that O
I O
deserved O
no O
extraordinary O
politeness O
, O
and O
I O
confess O
that O
I O
did O
not O
expect O
to O
receive O
_more_ O
than O
my O
due O
. O
" O
" O
My O
object O
_then_ O
, O
" O
replied O
Darcy O
, O
" O
was O
to O
shew O
you O
, O
by O
every O
civility O
in O
my O
power O
, O
that O
I O
was O
not O
so O
mean O
as O
to O
resent O
the O
past O
; O
and O
I O
hoped O
to O
obtain O
your O
forgiveness O
, O
to O
lessen O
your O
ill O
opinion O
, O
by O
letting O
you O
see O
that O
your O
reproofs O
had O
been O
attended O
to O
. O
How O
soon O
any O
other O
wishes O
introduced O
themselves O
I O
can O
hardly O
tell O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
in O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
after O
I O
had O
seen O
you O
. O
" O
He O
then O
told O
her O
of O
Georgiana O
's O
delight O
in O
her O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
of O
her O
disappointment O
at O
its O
sudden O
interruption O
; O
which O
naturally O
leading O
to O
the O
cause O
of O
that O
interruption O
, O
she O
soon O
learnt O
that O
his O
resolution O
of O
following O
her O
from O
Derbyshire O
in O
quest O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
had O
been O
formed O
before O
he O
quitted O
the O
inn O
, O
and O
that O
his O
gravity O
and O
thoughtfulness O
there O
, O
had O
arisen O
from O
no O
other O
struggles O
than O
what O
such O
a O
purpose O
must O
comprehend O
. O
She O
expressed O
her O
gratitude O
again O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
painful O
a O
subject O
to O
each O
, O
to O
be O
dwelt O
on O
farther O
. O
After O
walking O
several O
miles O
in O
a O
leisurely O
manner O
, O
and O
too O
busy O
to O
know O
any O
thing O
about O
it O
, O
they O
found O
at O
last O
, O
on O
examining O
their O
watches O
, O
that O
it O
was O
time O
to O
be O
at O
home O
. O
" O
What O
could O
become O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
Jane O
! O
" O
was O
a O
wonder O
which O
introduced O
the O
discussion O
of O
_their_ O
affairs O
. O
Darcy O
was O
delighted O
with O
their O
engagement O
; O
his O
friend O
had O
given O
him O
the O
earliest O
information O
of O
it O
. O
" O
I O
must O
ask O
whether O
you O
were O
surprised O
? O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
Not O
at O
all O
. O
When O
I O
went O
away O
, O
I O
felt O
that O
it O
would O
soon O
happen O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
you O
had O
given O
your O
permission O
. O
I O
guessed O
as O
much O
. O
" O
And O
though O
he O
exclaimed O
at O
the O
term O
, O
she O
found O
that O
it O
had O
been O
pretty O
much O
the O
case O
. O
" O
On O
the O
evening O
before O
my O
going O
to O
London O
, O
" O
said O
he O
" O
I O
made O
a O
confession O
to O
him O
, O
which O
I O
believe O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
made O
long O
ago O
. O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
that O
had O
occurred O
to O
make O
my O
former O
interference O
in O
his O
affairs O
, O
absurd O
and O
impertinent O
. O
His O
surprise O
was O
great O
. O
He O
had O
never O
had O
the O
slightest O
suspicion O
. O
I O
told O
him O
, O
moreover O
, O
that O
I O
believed O
myself O
mistaken O
in O
supposing O
, O
as O
I O
had O
done O
, O
that O
your O
sister O
was O
indifferent O
to O
him O
; O
and O
as O
I O
could O
easily O
perceive O
that O
his O
attachment O
to O
her O
was O
unabated O
, O
I O
felt O
no O
doubt O
of O
their O
happiness O
together O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
help O
smiling O
at O
his O
easy O
manner O
of O
directing O
his O
friend O
. O
" O
Did O
you O
speak O
from O
your O
own O
observation O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
when O
you O
told O
him O
that O
my O
sister O
loved O
him O
, O
or O
merely O
from O
my O
information O
last O
spring O
? O
" O
" O
From O
the O
former O
. O
I O
had O
narrowly O
observed O
her O
during O
the O
two O
visits O
which O
I O
had O
lately O
made O
her O
here O
; O
and O
I O
was O
convinced O
of O
her O
affection O
. O
" O
" O
And O
your O
assurance O
of O
it O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
carried O
immediate O
conviction O
to O
him O
. O
" O
" O
It O
did O
. O
Bingley O
is O
most O
unaffectedly O
modest O
. O
His O
diffidence O
had O
prevented O
his O
depending O
on O
his O
own O
judgment O
in O
so O
anxious O
a O
case O
, O
but O
his O
reliance O
on O
mine O
, O
made O
every O
thing O
easy O
. O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
confess O
one O
thing O
, O
which O
for O
a O
time O
, O
and O
not O
unjustly O
, O
offended O
him O
. O
I O
could O
not O
allow O
myself O
to O
conceal O
that O
your O
sister O
had O
been O
in O
town O
three O
months O
last O
winter O
, O
that O
I O
had O
known O
it O
, O
and O
purposely O
kept O
it O
from O
him O
. O
He O
was O
angry O
. O
But O
his O
anger O
, O
I O
am O
persuaded O
, O
lasted O
no O
longer O
than O
he O
remained O
in O
any O
doubt O
of O
your O
sister O
's O
sentiments O
. O
He O
has O
heartily O
forgiven O
me O
now O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
longed O
to O
observe O
that O
Mr. O
Bingley O
had O
been O
a O
most O
delightful O
friend O
; O
so O
easily O
guided O
that O
his O
worth O
was O
invaluable O
; O
but O
she O
checked O
herself O
. O
She O
remembered O
that O
he O
had O
yet O
to O
learn O
to O
be O
laught O
at O
, O
and O
it O
was O
rather O
too O
early O
to O
begin O
. O
In O
anticipating O
the O
happiness O
of O
Bingley O
, O
which O
of O
course O
was O
to O
be O
inferior O
only O
to O
his O
own O
, O
he O
continued O
the O
conversation O
till O
they O
reached O
the O
house O
. O
In O
the O
hall O
they O
parted O
