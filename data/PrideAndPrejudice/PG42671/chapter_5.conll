Within O
a O
short O
walk O
of O
Longbourn O
lived O
a O
family O
with O
whom O
the O
Bennets O
were O
particularly O
intimate O
. O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
had O
been O
formerly O
in O
trade O
in O
Meryton O
, O
where O
he O
had O
made O
a O
tolerable O
fortune O
and O
risen O
to O
the O
honour O
of O
knighthood O
by O
an O
address O
to O
the O
King O
, O
during O
his O
mayoralty O
. O
The O
distinction O
had O
perhaps O
been O
felt O
too O
strongly O
. O
It O
had O
given O
him O
a O
disgust O
to O
his O
business O
and O
to O
his O
residence O
in O
a O
small O
market O
town O
; O
and O
quitting O
them O
both O
, O
he O
had O
removed O
with O
his O
family O
to O
a O
house O
about O
a O
mile O
from O
Meryton O
, O
denominated O
from O
that O
period O
Lucas O
Lodge O
, O
where O
he O
could O
think O
with O
pleasure O
of O
his O
own O
importance O
, O
and O
unshackled O
by O
business O
, O
occupy O
himself O
solely O
in O
being O
civil O
to O
all O
the O
world O
. O
For O
though O
elated O
by O
his O
rank O
, O
it O
did O
not O
render O
him O
supercilious O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
he O
was O
all O
attention O
to O
every O
body O
. O
By O
nature O
inoffensive O
, O
friendly O
and O
obliging O
, O
his O
presentation O
at O
St. O
James O
's O
had O
made O
him O
courteous O
. O
Lady O
Lucas O
was O
a O
very O
good O
kind O
of O
woman O
, O
not O
too O
clever O
to O
be O
a O
valuable O
neighbour O
to O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet. O
-- O
They O
had O
several O
children O
. O
The O
eldest O
of O
them O
, O
a O
sensible O
, O
intelligent O
young O
woman O
, O
about O
twenty-seven O
, O
was O
Elizabeth O
's O
intimate O
friend O
. O
That O
the O
Miss O
Lucases O
and O
the O
Miss O
Bennets O
should O
meet O
to O
talk O
over O
a O
ball O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
; O
and O
the O
morning O
after O
the O
assembly O
brought O
the O
former O
to O
Longbourn O
to O
hear O
and O
to O
communicate O
. O
" O
_You_ O
began O
the O
evening O
well O
, O
Charlotte O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
with O
civil O
self-command O
to O
Miss O
Lucas O
. O
" O
_You_ O
were O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
first O
choice O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
-- O
but O
he O
seemed O
to O
like O
his O
second O
better O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
-- O
you O
mean O
Jane O
, O
I O
suppose O
-- O
because O
he O
danced O
with O
her O
twice O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
that O
_did_ O
seem O
as O
if O
he O
admired O
her O
-- O
indeed O
I O
rather O
believe O
he O
_did_ O
-- O
I O
heard O
something O
about O
it O
-- O
but O
I O
hardly O
know O
what O
-- O
something O
about O
Mr O
. O
Robinson O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
you O
mean O
what O
I O
overheard O
between O
him O
and O
Mr. O
Robinson O
; O
did O
not O
I O
mention O
it O
to O
you O
? O
Mr. O
Robinson O
's O
asking O
him O
how O
he O
liked O
our O
Meryton O
assemblies O
, O
and O
whether O
he O
did O
not O
think O
there O
were O
a O
great O
many O
pretty O
women O
in O
the O
room O
, O
and O
_which_ O
he O
thought O
the O
prettiest O
? O
and O
his O
answering O
immediately O
to O
the O
last O
question O
-- O
Oh O
! O
the O
eldest O
Miss O
Bennet O
beyond O
a O
doubt O
, O
there O
can O
not O
be O
two O
opinions O
on O
that O
point O
. O
" O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
! O
-- O
Well O
, O
that O
was O
very O
decided O
indeed O
-- O
that O
does O
seem O
as O
if O
-- O
-- O
but O
however O
, O
it O
may O
all O
come O
to O
nothing O
you O
know O
. O
" O
" O
_My_ O
overhearings O
were O
more O
to O
the O
purpose O
than O
_yours_ O
, O
Eliza O
, O
" O
said O
Charlotte O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
not O
so O
well O
worth O
listening O
to O
as O
his O
friend O
, O
is O
he O
? O
-- O
Poor O
Eliza O
! O
-- O
to O
be O
only O
just O
_tolerable_ O
. O
" O
" O
I O
beg O
you O
would O
not O
put O
it O
into O
Lizzy O
's O
head O
to O
be O
vexed O
by O
his O
ill-treatment O
; O
for O
he O
is O
such O
a O
disagreeable O
man O
that O
it O
would O
be O
quite O
a O
misfortune O
to O
be O
liked O
by O
him O
. O
Mrs. O
Long O
told O
me O
last O
night O
that O
he O
sat O
close O
to O
her O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
without O
once O
opening O
his O
lips O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
quite O
sure O
, O
Ma'am O
? O
-- O
is O
not O
there O
a O
little O
mistake O
? O
" O
said O
Jane. O
-- O
" O
I O
certainly O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy O
speaking O
to O
her O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
-- O
because O
she O
asked O
him O
at O
last O
how O
he O
liked O
Netherfield O
, O
and O
he O
could O
not O
help O
answering O
her O
; O
-- O
but O
she O
said O
he O
seemed O
very O
angry O
at O
being O
spoke O
to O
. O
" O
" O
Miss O
Bingley O
told O
me O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
, O
" O
that O
he O
never O
speaks O
much O
unless O
among O
his O
intimate O
acquaintance O
. O
With O
_them_ O
he O
is O
remarkably O
agreeable O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
a O
word O
of O
it O
, O
my O
dear O
. O
If O
he O
had O
been O
so O
very O
agreeable O
he O
would O
have O
talked O
to O
Mrs. O
Long O
. O
But O
I O
can O
guess O
how O
it O
was O
; O
every O
body O
says O
that O
he O
is O
ate O
up O
with O
pride O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
had O
heard O
somehow O
that O
Mrs. O
Long O
does O
not O
keep O
a O
carriage O
, O
and O
had O
come O
to O
the O
ball O
in O
a O
hack O
chaise O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
mind O
his O
not O
talking O
to O
Mrs. O
Long O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
" O
but O
I O
wish O
he O
had O
danced O
with O
Eliza O
. O
" O
" O
Another O
time O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
I O
would O
not O
dance O
with O
_him_ O
, O
if O
I O
were O
you O
. O
" O
" O
I O
believe O
, O
Ma'am O
, O
I O
may O
safely O
promise O
you O
_never_ O
to O
dance O
with O
him O
. O
" O
" O
His O
pride O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
" O
does O
not O
offend O
_me_ O
so O
much O
as O
pride O
often O
does O
, O
because O
there O
is O
an O
excuse O
for O
it O
. O
One O
can O
not O
wonder O
that O
so O
very O
fine O
a O
young O
man O
, O
with O
family O
, O
fortune O
, O
every O
thing O
in O
his O
favour O
, O
should O
think O
highly O
of O
himself O
. O
If O
I O
may O
so O
express O
it O
, O
he O
has O
a O
_right_ O
to O
be O
proud O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
very O
true O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
and O
I O
could O
easily O
forgive O
_his_ O
pride O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
mortified O
_mine_ O
. O
" O
" O
Pride O
, O
" O
observed O
Mary O
, O
who O
piqued O
herself O
upon O
the O
solidity O
of O
her O
reflections O
, O
" O
is O
a O
very O
common O
failing O
I O
believe O
. O
By O
all O
that O
I O
have O
ever O
read O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
it O
is O
very O
common O
indeed O
, O
that O
human O
nature O
is O
particularly O
prone O
to O
it O
, O
and O
that O
there O
are O
very O
few O
of O
us O
who O
do O
not O
cherish O
a O
feeling O
of O
self-complacency O
on O
the O
score O
of O
some O
quality O
or O
other O
, O
real O
or O
imaginary O
. O
Vanity O
and O
pride O
are O
different O
things O
, O
though O
the O
words O
are O
often O
used O
synonimously O
. O
A O
person O
may O
be O
proud O
without O
being O
vain O
. O
Pride O
relates O
more O
to O
our O
opinion O
of O
ourselves O
, O
vanity O
to O
what O
we O
would O
have O
others O
think O
of O
us O
. O
" O
" O
If O
I O
were O
as O
rich O
as O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
" O
cried O
a O
young O
Lucas O
who O
came O
with O
his O
sisters O
, O
" O
I O
should O
not O
care O
how O
proud O
I O
was O
. O
I O
would O
keep O
a O
pack O
of O
foxhounds O
, O
and O
drink O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
every O
day O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
you O
would O
drink O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
than O
you O
ought O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
; O
" O
and O
if O
I O
were O
to O
see O
you O
at O
it O
I O
should O
take O
away O
your O
bottle O
directly O
. O
" O
The O
boy O
protested O
that O
she O
should O
not O
; O
she O
continued O
to O
declare O
that O
she O
would O
, O
and O
the O
argument O
ended O
only O
with O
the O
visit O
. O
