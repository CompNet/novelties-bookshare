Elizabeth O
was O
sitting O
with O
her O
mother O
and O
sisters O
, O
reflecting O
on O
what O
she O
had O
heard O
, O
and O
doubting O
whether O
she O
were O
authorised O
to O
mention O
it O
, O
when O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
himself O
appeared O
, O
sent O
by O
his O
daughter O
to O
announce O
her O
engagement O
to O
the O
family O
. O
With O
many O
compliments O
to O
them O
, O
and O
much O
self-gratulation O
on O
the O
prospect O
of O
a O
connection O
between O
the O
houses O
, O
he O
unfolded O
the O
matter O
, O
-- O
to O
an O
audience O
not O
merely O
wondering O
, O
but O
incredulous O
; O
for O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
with O
more O
perseverance O
than O
politeness O
, O
protested O
he O
must O
be O
entirely O
mistaken O
, O
and O
Lydia O
, O
always O
unguarded O
and O
often O
uncivil O
, O
boisterously O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Good O
Lord O
! O
Sir O
William O
, O
how O
can O
you O
tell O
such O
a O
story O
? O
-- O
Do O
not O
you O
know O
that O
Mr. O
Collins O
wants O
to O
marry O
Lizzy O
? O
" O
Nothing O
less O
than O
the O
complaisance O
of O
a O
courtier O
could O
have O
borne O
without O
anger O
such O
treatment O
; O
but O
Sir O
William O
's O
good O
breeding O
carried O
him O
through O
it O
all O
; O
and O
though O
he O
begged O
leave O
to O
be O
positive O
as O
to O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
information O
, O
he O
listened O
to O
all O
their O
impertinence O
with O
the O
most O
forbearing O
courtesy O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
feeling O
it O
incumbent O
on O
her O
to O
relieve O
him O
from O
so O
unpleasant O
a O
situation O
, O
now O
put O
herself O
forward O
to O
confirm O
his O
account O
, O
by O
mentioning O
her O
prior O
knowledge O
of O
it O
from O
Charlotte O
herself O
; O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
put O
a O
stop O
to O
the O
exclamations O
of O
her O
mother O
and O
sisters O
, O
by O
the O
earnestness O
of O
her O
congratulations O
to O
Sir O
William O
, O
in O
which O
she O
was O
readily O
joined O
by O
Jane O
, O
and O
by O
making O
a O
variety O
of O
remarks O
on O
the O
happiness O
that O
might O
be O
expected O
from O
the O
match O
, O
the O
excellent O
character O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
and O
the O
convenient O
distance O
of O
Hunsford O
from O
London O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
in O
fact O
too O
much O
overpowered O
to O
say O
a O
great O
deal O
while O
Sir O
William O
remained O
; O
but O
no O
sooner O
had O
he O
left O
them O
than O
her O
feelings O
found O
a O
rapid O
vent O
. O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
she O
persisted O
in O
disbelieving O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
matter O
; O
secondly O
, O
she O
was O
very O
sure O
that O
Mr. O
Collins O
had O
been O
taken O
in O
; O
thirdly O
, O
she O
trusted O
that O
they O
would O
never O
be O
happy O
together O
; O
and O
fourthly O
, O
that O
the O
match O
might O
be O
broken O
off O
. O
Two O
inferences O
, O
however O
, O
were O
plainly O
deduced O
from O
the O
whole O
; O
one O
, O
that O
Elizabeth O
was O
the O
real O
cause O
of O
all O
the O
mischief O
; O
and O
the O
other O
, O
that O
she O
herself O
had O
been O
barbarously O
used O
by O
them O
all O
; O
and O
on O
these O
two O
points O
she O
principally O
dwelt O
during O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O
Nothing O
could O
console O
and O
nothing O
appease O
her. O
-- O
Nor O
did O
that O
day O
wear O
out O
her O
resentment O
. O
A O
week O
elapsed O
before O
she O
could O
see O
Elizabeth O
without O
scolding O
her O
, O
a O
month O
passed O
away O
before O
she O
could O
speak O
to O
Sir O
William O
or O
Lady O
Lucas O
without O
being O
rude O
, O
and O
many O
months O
were O
gone O
before O
she O
could O
at O
all O
forgive O
their O
daughter O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
emotions O
were O
much O
more O
tranquil O
on O
the O
occasion O
, O
and O
such O
as O
he O
did O
experience O
he O
pronounced O
to O
be O
of O
a O
most O
agreeable O
sort O
; O
for O
it O
gratified O
him O
, O
he O
said O
, O
to O
discover O
that O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
, O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
used O
to O
think O
tolerably O
sensible O
, O
was O
as O
foolish O
as O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
more O
foolish O
than O
his O
daughter O
! O
Jane O
confessed O
herself O
a O
little O
surprised O
at O
the O
match O
; O
but O
she O
said O
less O
of O
her O
astonishment O
than O
of O
her O
earnest O
desire O
for O
their O
happiness O
; O
nor O
could O
Elizabeth O
persuade O
her O
to O
consider O
it O
as O
improbable O
. O
Kitty O
and O
Lydia O
were O
far O
from O
envying O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
only O
a O
clergyman O
; O
and O
it O
affected O
them O
in O
no O
other O
way O
than O
as O
a O
piece O
of O
news O
to O
spread O
at O
Meryton O
. O
Lady O
Lucas O
could O
not O
be O
insensible O
of O
triumph O
on O
being O
able O
to O
retort O
on O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
the O
comfort O
of O
having O
a O
daughter O
well O
married O
; O
and O
she O
called O
at O
Longbourn O
rather O
oftener O
than O
usual O
to O
say O
how O
happy O
she O
was O
, O
though O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
sour O
looks O
and O
ill-natured O
remarks O
might O
have O
been O
enough O
to O
drive O
happiness O
away O
. O
Between O
Elizabeth O
and O
Charlotte O
there O
was O
a O
restraint O
which O
kept O
them O
mutually O
silent O
on O
the O
subject O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
felt O
persuaded O
that O
no O
real O
confidence O
could O
ever O
subsist O
between O
them O
again O
. O
Her O
disappointment O
in O
Charlotte O
made O
her O
turn O
with O
fonder O
regard O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
of O
whose O
rectitude O
and O
delicacy O
she O
was O
sure O
her O
opinion O
could O
never O
be O
shaken O
, O
and O
for O
whose O
happiness O
she O
grew O
daily O
more O
anxious O
, O
as O
Bingley O
had O
now O
been O
gone O
a O
week O
, O
and O
nothing O
was O
heard O
of O
his O
return O
. O
Jane O
had O
sent O
Caroline O
an O
early O
answer O
to O
her O
letter O
, O
and O
was O
counting O
the O
days O
till O
she O
might O
reasonably O
hope O
to O
hear O
again O
. O
The O
promised O
letter O
of O
thanks O
from O
Mr. O
Collins O
arrived O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
addressed O
to O
their O
father O
, O
and O
written O
with O
all O
the O
solemnity O
of O
gratitude O
which O
a O
twelvemonth O
's O
abode O
in O
the O
family O
might O
have O
prompted O
. O
After O
discharging O
his O
conscience O
on O
that O
head O
, O
he O
proceeded O
to O
inform O
them O
, O
with O
many O
rapturous O
expressions O
, O
of O
his O
happiness O
in O
having O
obtained O
the O
affection O
of O
their O
amiable O
neighbour O
, O
Miss O
Lucas O
, O
and O
then O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
merely O
with O
the O
view O
of O
enjoying O
her O
society O
that O
he O
had O
been O
so O
ready O
to O
close O
with O
their O
kind O
wish O
of O
seeing O
him O
again O
at O
Longbourn O
, O
whither O
he O
hoped O
to O
be O
able O
to O
return O
on O
Monday O
fortnight O
; O
for O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
he O
added O
, O
so O
heartily O
approved O
his O
marriage O
, O
that O
she O
wished O
it O
to O
take O
place O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
, O
which O
he O
trusted O
would O
be O
an O
unanswerable O
argument O
with O
his O
amiable O
Charlotte O
to O
name O
an O
early O
day O
for O
making O
him O
the O
happiest O
of O
men O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
return O
into O
Hertfordshire O
was O
no O
longer O
a O
matter O
of O
pleasure O
to O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
she O
was O
as O
much O
disposed O
to O
complain O
of O
it O
as O
her O
husband. O
-- O
It O
was O
very O
strange O
that O
he O
should O
come O
to O
Longbourn O
instead O
of O
to O
Lucas O
Lodge O
; O
it O
was O
also O
very O
inconvenient O
and O
exceedingly O
troublesome. O
-- O
She O
hated O
having O
visitors O
in O
the O
house O
while O
her O
health O
was O
so O
indifferent O
, O
and O
lovers O
were O
of O
all O
people O
the O
most O
disagreeable O
. O
Such O
were O
the O
gentle O
murmurs O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
and O
they O
gave O
way O
only O
to O
the O
greater O
distress O
of O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
continued O
absence O
. O
Neither O
Jane O
nor O
Elizabeth O
were O
comfortable O
on O
this O
subject O
. O
Day O
after O
day O
passed O
away O
without O
bringing O
any O
other O
tidings O
of O
him O
than O
the O
report O
which O
shortly O
prevailed O
in O
Meryton O
of O
his O
coming O
no O
more O
to O
Netherfield O
the O
whole O
winter O
; O
a O
report O
which O
highly O
incensed O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
, O
and O
which O
she O
never O
failed O
to O
contradict O
as O
a O
most O
scandalous O
falsehood O
. O
Even O
Elizabeth O
began O
to O
fear O
-- O
not O
that O
Bingley O
was O
indifferent O
-- O
but O
that O
his O
sisters O
would O
be O
successful O
in O
keeping O
him O
away O
. O
Unwilling O
as O
she O
was O
to O
admit O
an O
idea O
so O
destructive O
of O
Jane O
's O
happiness O
, O
and O
so O
dishonourable O
to O
the O
stability O
of O
her O
lover O
, O
she O
could O
not O
prevent O
its O
frequently O
recurring O
. O
The O
united O
efforts O
of O
his O
two O
unfeeling O
sisters O
and O
of O
his O
overpowering O
friend O
, O
assisted O
by O
the O
attractions O
of O
Miss O
Darcy O
and O
the O
amusements O
of O
London O
, O
might O
be O
too O
much O
, O
she O
feared O
, O
for O
the O
strength O
of O
his O
attachment O
. O
As O
for O
Jane O
, O
_her_ O
anxiety O
under O
this O
suspence O
was O
, O
of O
course O
, O
more O
painful O
than O
Elizabeth O
's O
; O
but O
whatever O
she O
felt O
she O
was O
desirous O
of O
concealing O
, O
and O
between O
herself O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
subject O
was O
never O
alluded O
to O
. O
But O
as O
no O
such O
delicacy O
restrained O
her O
mother O
, O
an O
hour O
seldom O
passed O
in O
which O
she O
did O
not O
talk O
of O
Bingley O
, O
express O
her O
impatience O
for O
his O
arrival O
, O
or O
even O
require O
Jane O
to O
confess O
that O
if O
he O
did O
not O
come O
back O
, O
she O
should O
think O
herself O
very O
ill O
used O
. O
It O
needed O
all O
Jane O
's O
steady O
mildness O
to O
bear O
these O
attacks O
with O
tolerable O
tranquillity O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
returned O
most O
punctually O
on O
the O
Monday O
fortnight O
, O
but O
his O
reception O
at O
Longbourn O
was O
not O
quite O
so O
gracious O
as O
it O
had O
been O
on O
his O
first O
introduction O
. O
He O
was O
too O
happy O
, O
however O
, O
to O
need O
much O
attention O
; O
and O
luckily O
for O
the O
others O
, O
the O
business O
of O
love-making O
relieved O
them O
from O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
his O
company O
. O
The O
chief O
of O
every O
day O
was O
spent O
by O
him O
at O
Lucas O
Lodge O
, O
and O
he O
sometimes O
returned O
to O
Longbourn O
only O
in O
time O
to O
make O
an O
apology O
for O
his O
absence O
before O
the O
family O
went O
to O
bed O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
really O
in O
a O
most O
pitiable O
state O
. O
The O
very O
mention O
of O
any O
thing O
concerning O
the O
match O
threw O
her O
into O
an O
agony O
of O
ill O
humour O
, O
and O
wherever O
she O
went O
she O
was O
sure O
of O
hearing O
it O
talked O
of O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
Miss O
Lucas O
was O
odious O
to O
her O
. O
As O
her O
successor O
in O
that O
house O
, O
she O
regarded O
her O
with O
jealous O
abhorrence O
. O
Whenever O
Charlotte O
came O
to O
see O
them O
she O
concluded O
her O
to O
be O
anticipating O
the O
hour O
of O
possession O
; O
and O
whenever O
she O
spoke O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
to O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
was O
convinced O
that O
they O
were O
talking O
of O
the O
Longbourn O
estate O
, O
and O
resolving O
to O
turn O
herself O
and O
her O
daughters O
out O
of O
the O
house O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
Mr. O
Bennet O
were O
dead O
. O
She O
complained O
bitterly O
of O
all O
this O
to O
her O
husband O
. O
" O
Indeed O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
it O
is O
very O
hard O
to O
think O
that O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
should O
ever O
be O
mistress O
of O
this O
house O
, O
that O
I O
should O
be O
forced O
to O
make O
way O
for O
_her_ O
, O
and O
live O
to O
see O
her O
take O
my O
place O
in O
it O
! O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
do O
not O
give O
way O
to O
such O
gloomy O
thoughts O
. O
Let O
us O
hope O
for O
better O
things O
. O
Let O
us O
flatter O
ourselves O
that O
_I_ O
may O
be O
the O
survivor O
. O
" O
This O
was O
not O
very O
consoling O
to O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
instead O
of O
making O
any O
answer O
, O
she O
went O
on O
as O
before O
, O
" O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
think O
that O
they O
should O
have O
all O
this O
estate O
. O
If O
it O
was O
not O
for O
the O
entail O
I O
should O
not O
mind O
it O
. O
" O
" O
What O
should O
not O
you O
mind O
? O
" O
" O
I O
should O
not O
mind O
any O
thing O
at O
all O
. O
" O
" O
Let O
us O
be O
thankful O
that O
you O
are O
preserved O
from O
a O
state O
of O
such O
insensibility O
. O
" O
" O
I O
never O
can O
be O
thankful O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
for O
any O
thing O
about O
the O
entail O
. O
How O
any O
one O
could O
have O
the O
conscience O
to O
entail O
away O
an O
estate O
from O
one O
's O
own O
daughters O
I O
can O
not O
understand O
; O
and O
all O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
too O
! O
-- O
Why O
should O
_he_ O
have O
it O
more O
than O
anybody O
else O
? O
" O
" O
I O
leave O
it O
to O
yourself O
to O
determine O
, O

Mr. O
