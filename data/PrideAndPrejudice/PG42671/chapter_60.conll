Elizabeth O
's O
spirits O
soon O
rising O
to O
playfulness O
again O
, O
she O
wanted O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
to O
account O
for O
his O
having O
ever O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
her O
. O
" O
How O
could O
you O
begin O
? O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
I O
can O
comprehend O
your O
going O
on O
charmingly O
, O
when O
you O
had O
once O
made O
a O
beginning O
; O
but O
what O
could O
set O
you O
off O
in O
the O
first O
place O
? O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
fix O
on O
the O
hour O
, O
or O
the O
spot O
, O
or O
the O
look O
, O
or O
the O
words O
, O
which O
laid O
the O
foundation O
. O
It O
is O
too O
long O
ago O
. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
before O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
_had_ O
begun O
. O
" O
" O
My O
beauty O
you O
had O
early O
withstood O
, O
and O
as O
for O
my O
manners O
-- O
my O
behaviour O
to O
_you_ O
was O
at O
least O
always O
bordering O
on O
the O
uncivil O
, O
and O
I O
never O
spoke O
to O
you O
without O
rather O
wishing O
to O
give O
you O
pain O
than O
not O
. O
Now O
be O
sincere O
; O
did O
you O
admire O
me O
for O
my O
impertinence O
? O
" O
" O
For O
the O
liveliness O
of O
your O
mind O
, O
I O
did O
. O
" O
" O
You O
may O
as O
well O
call O
it O
impertinence O
at O
once O
. O
It O
was O
very O
little O
less O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
you O
were O
sick O
of O
civility O
, O
of O
deference O
, O
of O
officious O
attention O
. O
You O
were O
disgusted O
with O
the O
women O
who O
were O
always O
speaking O
and O
looking O
, O
and O
thinking O
for O
_your_ O
approbation O
alone O
. O
I O
roused O
, O
and O
interested O
you O
, O
because O
I O
was O
so O
unlike O
_them_ O
. O
Had O
you O
not O
been O
really O
amiable O
you O
would O
have O
hated O
me O
for O
it O
; O
but O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
pains O
you O
took O
to O
disguise O
yourself O
, O
your O
feelings O
were O
always O
noble O
and O
just O
; O
and O
in O
your O
heart O
, O
you O
thoroughly O
despised O
the O
persons O
who O
so O
assiduously O
courted O
you O
. O
There O
-- O
I O
have O
saved O
you O
the O
trouble O
of O
accounting O
for O
it O
; O
and O
really O
, O
all O
things O
considered O
, O
I O
begin O
to O
think O
it O
perfectly O
reasonable O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
you O
knew O
no O
actual O
good O
of O
me O
-- O
but O
nobody O
thinks O
of O
_that_ O
when O
they O
fall O
in O
love O
. O
" O
" O
Was O
there O
no O
good O
in O
your O
affectionate O
behaviour O
to O
Jane O
, O
while O
she O
was O
ill O
at O
Netherfield O
? O
" O
" O
Dearest O
Jane O
! O
who O
could O
have O
done O
less O
for O
her O
? O
But O
make O
a O
virtue O
of O
it O
by O
all O
means O
. O
My O
good O
qualities O
are O
under O
your O
protection O
, O
and O
you O
are O
to O
exaggerate O
them O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
; O
and O
, O
in O
return O
, O
it O
belongs O
to O
me O
to O
find O
occasions O
for O
teazing O
and O
quarrelling O
with O
you O
as O
often O
as O
may O
be O
; O
and O
I O
shall O
begin O
directly O
by O
asking O
you O
what O
made O
you O
so O
unwilling O
to O
come O
to O
the O
point O
at O
last O
. O
What O
made O
you O
so O
shy O
of O
me O
, O
when O
you O
first O
called O
, O
and O
afterwards O
dined O
here O
? O
Why O
, O
especially O
, O
when O
you O
called O
, O
did O
you O
look O
as O
if O
you O
did O
not O
care O
about O
me O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
you O
were O
grave O
and O
silent O
, O
and O
gave O
me O
no O
encouragement O
. O
" O
" O
But O
I O
was O
embarrassed O
. O
" O
" O
And O
so O
was O
I O
. O
" O
" O
You O
might O
have O
talked O
to O
me O
more O
when O
you O
came O
to O
dinner O
. O
" O
" O
A O
man O
who O
had O
felt O
less O
, O
might O
. O
" O
" O
How O
unlucky O
that O
you O
should O
have O
a O
reasonable O
answer O
to O
give O
, O
and O
that O
I O
should O
be O
so O
reasonable O
as O
to O
admit O
it O
! O
But O
I O
wonder O
how O
long O
you O
_would_ O
have O
gone O
on O
, O
if O
you O
had O
been O
left O
to O
yourself O
. O
I O
wonder O
when O
you O
_would_ O
have O
spoken O
, O
if O
I O
had O
not O
asked O
you O
! O
My O
resolution O
of O
thanking O
you O
for O
your O
kindness O
to O
Lydia O
had O
certainly O
great O
effect O
. O
_Too O
much_ O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
; O
for O
what O
becomes O
of O
the O
moral O
, O
if O
our O
comfort O
springs O
from O
a O
breach O
of O
promise O
, O
for O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
mentioned O
the O
subject O
? O
This O
will O
never O
do O
. O
" O
" O
You O
need O
not O
distress O
yourself O
. O
The O
moral O
will O
be O
perfectly O
fair O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
unjustifiable O
endeavours O
to O
separate O
us O
, O
were O
the O
means O
of O
removing O
all O
my O
doubts O
. O
I O
am O
not O
indebted O
for O
my O
present O
happiness O
to O
your O
eager O
desire O
of O
expressing O
your O
gratitude O
. O
I O
was O
not O
in O
a O
humour O
to O
wait O
for O
any O
opening O
of O
your O
's O
. O
My O
aunt O
's O
intelligence O
had O
given O
me O
hope O
, O
and O
I O
was O
determined O
at O
once O
to O
know O
every O
thing O
. O
" O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
has O
been O
of O
infinite O
use O
, O
which O
ought O
to O
make O
her O
happy O
, O
for O
she O
loves O
to O
be O
of O
use O
. O
But O
tell O
me O
, O
what O
did O
you O
come O
down O
to O
Netherfield O
for O
? O
Was O
it O
merely O
to O
ride O
to O
Longbourn O
and O
be O
embarrassed O
? O
or O
had O
you O
intended O
any O
more O
serious O
consequence O
? O
" O
" O
My O
real O
purpose O
was O
to O
see O
_you_ O
, O
and O
to O
judge O
, O
if O
I O
could O
, O
whether O
I O
might O
ever O
hope O
to O
make O
you O
love O
me O
. O
My O
avowed O
one O
, O
or O
what O
I O
avowed O
to O
myself O
, O
was O
to O
see O
whether O
your O
sister O
were O
still O
partial O
to O
Bingley O
, O
and O
if O
she O
were O
, O
to O
make O
the O
confession O
to O
him O
which O
I O
have O
since O
made O
. O
" O
" O
Shall O
you O
ever O
have O
courage O
to O
announce O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
what O
is O
to O
befall O
her O
? O
" O
" O
I O
am O
more O
likely O
to O
want O
time O
than O
courage O
, O
Elizabeth O
. O
But O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
if O
you O
will O
give O
me O
a O
sheet O
of O
paper O
, O
it O
shall O
be O
done O
directly O
. O
" O
" O
And O
if O
I O
had O
not O
a O
letter O
to O
write O
myself O
, O
I O
might O
sit O
by O
you O
, O
and O
admire O
the O
evenness O
of O
your O
writing O
, O
as O
another O
young O
lady O
once O
did O
. O
But O
I O
have O
an O
aunt O
, O
too O
, O
who O
must O
not O
be O
longer O
neglected O
. O
" O
From O
an O
unwillingness O
to O
confess O
how O
much O
her O
intimacy O
with O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
been O
over-rated O
, O
Elizabeth O
had O
never O
yet O
answered O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
's O
long O
letter O
, O
but O
now O
, O
having O
_that_ O
to O
communicate O
which O
she O
knew O
would O
be O
most O
welcome O
, O
she O
was O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
find O
, O
that O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
had O
already O
lost O
three O
days O
of O
happiness O
, O
and O
immediately O
wrote O
as O
follows O
: O
" O
I O
would O
have O
thanked O
you O
before O
, O
my O
dear O
aunt O
, O
as O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
, O
for O
your O
long O
, O
kind O
, O
satisfactory O
, O
detail O
of O
particulars O
; O
but O
to O
say O
the O
truth O
, O
I O
was O
too O
cross O
to O
write O
. O
You O
supposed O
more O
than O
really O
existed O
. O
But O
_now_ O
suppose O
as O
much O
as O
you O
chuse O
; O
give O
a O
loose O
to O
your O
fancy O
, O
indulge O
your O
imagination O
in O
every O
possible O
flight O
which O
the O
subject O
will O
afford O
, O
and O
unless O
you O
believe O
me O
actually O
married O
, O
you O
can O
not O
greatly O
err O
. O
You O
must O
write O
again O
very O
soon O
, O
and O
praise O
him O
a O
great O
deal O
more O
than O
you O
did O
in O
your O
last O
. O
I O
thank O
you O
, O
again O
and O
again O
, O
for O
not O
going O
to O
the O
Lakes O
. O
How O
could O
I O
be O
so O
silly O
as O
to O
wish O
it O
! O
Your O
idea O
of O
the O
ponies O
is O
delightful O
. O
We O
will O
go O
round O
the O
Park O
every O
day O
. O
I O
am O
the O
happiest O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Perhaps O
other O
people O
have O
said O
so O
before O
, O
but O
not O
one O
with O
such O
justice O
. O
I O
am O
happier O
even O
than O
Jane O
; O
she O
only O
smiles O
, O
I O
laugh O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
sends O
you O
all O
the O
love O
in O
the O
world O
, O
that O
he O
can O
spare O
from O
me O
. O
You O
are O
all O
to O
come O
to O
Pemberley O
at O
Christmas O

Your O

" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
letter O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
was O
in O
a O
different O
style O
; O
and O
still O
different O
from O
either O
, O
was O
what O
Mr. O
Bennet O
sent O
to O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
in O
reply O
to O
his O
last O
. O
" O
DEAR O
SIR O
, O
" O
I O
must O
trouble O
you O
once O
more O
for O
congratulations O
. O
Elizabeth O
will O
soon O
be O
the O
wife O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
Console O
Lady O
Catherine O
as O
well O
as O
you O
can O
. O
But O
, O
if O
I O
were O
you O
, O
I O
would O
stand O
by O
the O
nephew O
. O
He O
has O
more O
to O
give O
. O
" O
Your O
's O
sincerely O
, O
& O
c O
. O
" O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
congratulations O
to O
her O
brother O
, O
on O
his O
approaching O
marriage O
, O
were O
all O
that O
was O
affectionate O
and O
insincere O
. O
She O
wrote O
even O
to O
Jane O
on O
the O
occasion O
, O
to O
express O
her O
delight O
, O
and O
repeat O
all O
her O
former O
professions O
of O
regard O
. O
Jane O
was O
not O
deceived O
, O
but O
she O
was O
affected O
; O
and O
though O
feeling O
no O
reliance O
on O
her O
, O
could O
not O
help O
writing O
her O
a O
much O
kinder O
answer O
than O
she O
knew O
was O
deserved O
. O
The O
joy O
which O
Miss O
Darcy O
expressed O
on O
receiving O
similar O
information O
, O
was O
as O
sincere O
as O
her O
brother O
's O
in O
sending O
it O
. O
Four O
sides O
of O
paper O
were O
insufficient O
to O
contain O
all O
her O
delight O
, O
and O
all O
her O
earnest O
desire O
of O
being O
loved O
by O
her O
sister O
. O
Before O
any O
answer O
could O
arrive O
from O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
or O
any O
congratulations O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
from O
his O
wife O
, O
the O
Longbourn O
family O
heard O
that O
the O
Collinses O
were O
come O
themselves O
to O
Lucas O
lodge O
. O
The O
reason O
of O
this O
sudden O
removal O
was O
soon O
evident O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
had O
been O
rendered O
so O
exceedingly O
angry O
by O
the O
contents O
of O
her O
nephew O
's O
letter O
, O
that O
Charlotte O
, O
really O
rejoicing O
in O
the O
match O
, O
was O
anxious O
to O
get O
away O
till O
the O
storm O
was O
blown O
over O
. O
At O
such O
a O
moment O
, O
the O
arrival O
of O
her O
friend O
was O
a O
sincere O
pleasure O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
though O
in O
the O
course O
of O
their O
meetings O
she O
must O
sometimes O
think O
the O
pleasure O
dearly O
bought O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
Mr. O
Darcy O
exposed O
to O
all O
the O
parading O
and O
obsequious O
civility O
of O
her O
husband O
. O
He O
bore O
it O
however O
with O
admirable O
calmness O
. O
He O
could O
even O
listen O
to O
Sir O
William O
Lucas O
, O
when O
he O
complimented O
him O
on O
carrying O
away O
the O
brightest O
jewel O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
expressed O
his O
hopes O
of O
their O
all O
meeting O
frequently O
at O
St. O
James O
's O
, O
with O
very O
decent O
composure O
. O
If O
he O
did O
shrug O
his O
shoulders O
, O
it O
was O
not O
till O
Sir O
William O
was O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
Mrs. O
Philips O
's O
vulgarity O
was O
another O
, O
and O
perhaps O
a O
greater O
tax O
on O
his O
forbearance O
; O
and O
though O
Mrs. O
Philips O
, O
as O
well O
as O
her O
sister O
, O
stood O
in O
too O
much O
awe O
of O
him O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
familiarity O
which O
Bingley O
's O
good O
humour O
encouraged O
, O
yet O
, O
whenever O
she O
_did_ O
speak O
, O
she O
must O
be O
vulgar O
. O
Nor O
was O
her O
respect O
for O
him O
, O
though O
it O
made O
her O
more O
quiet O
, O
at O
all O
likely O
to O
make O
her O
more O
elegant O
. O
Elizabeth O
did O
all O
she O
could O
, O
to O
shield O
him O
from O
the O
frequent O
notice O
of O
either O
, O
and O
was O
ever O
anxious O
to O
keep O
him O
to O
herself O
, O
and O
to O
those O
of O
her O
family O
with O
whom O
he O
might O
converse O
without O
mortification O
; O
and O
though O
the O
uncomfortable O
feelings O
arising O
from O
all O
this O
took O
from O
the O
season O
of O
courtship O
much O
of O
its O
pleasure O
, O
it O
added O
to O
the O
hope O
of O
the O
future O
; O
and O
she O
looked O
forward O
with O
delight O
to O
the O
time O
when O
they O
should O
be O
removed O
from O
society O
so O
little O
pleasing O
to O
either O
, O
to O
all O
the O
comfort O
and O
elegance O
of O
their O
family O
party O
at O
Pemberley O
. O
