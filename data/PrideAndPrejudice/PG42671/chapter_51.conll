Their O
sister O
's O
wedding O
day O
arrived O
; O
and O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
felt O
for O
her O
probably O
more O
than O
she O
felt O
for O
herself O
. O
The O
carriage O
was O
sent O
to O
meet O
them O
at O
-- O
-- O
, O
and O
they O
were O
to O
return O
in O
it O
, O
by O
dinner-time O
. O
Their O
arrival O
was O
dreaded O
by O
the O
elder O
Miss O
Bennets O
; O
and O
Jane O
more O
especially O
, O
who O
gave O
Lydia O
the O
feelings O
which O
would O
have O
attended O
herself O
, O
had O
_she_ O
been O
the O
culprit O
, O
was O
wretched O
in O
the O
thought O
of O
what O
her O
sister O
must O
endure O
. O
They O
came O
. O
The O
family O
were O
assembled O
in O
the O
breakfast O
room O
, O
to O
receive O
them O
. O
Smiles O
decked O
the O
face O
of O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
as O
the O
carriage O
drove O
up O
to O
the O
door O
; O
her O
husband O
looked O
impenetrably O
grave O
; O
her O
daughters O
, O
alarmed O
, O
anxious O
, O
uneasy O
. O
Lydia O
's O
voice O
was O
heard O
in O
the O
vestibule O
; O
the O
door O
was O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
she O
ran O
into O
the O
room O
. O
Her O
mother O
stepped O
forwards O
, O
embraced O
her O
, O
and O
welcomed O
her O
with O
rapture O
; O
gave O
her O
hand O
with O
an O
affectionate O
smile O
to O
Wickham O
, O
who O
followed O
his O
lady O
, O
and O
wished O
them O
both O
joy O
, O
with O
an O
alacrity O
which O
shewed O
no O
doubt O
of O
their O
happiness O
. O
Their O
reception O
from O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
to O
whom O
they O
then O
turned O
, O
was O
not O
quite O
so O
cordial O
. O
His O
countenance O
rather O
gained O
in O
austerity O
; O
and O
he O
scarcely O
opened O
his O
lips O
. O
The O
easy O
assurance O
of O
the O
young O
couple O
, O
indeed O
, O
was O
enough O
to O
provoke O
him O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
disgusted O
, O
and O
even O
Miss O
Bennet O
was O
shocked O
. O
Lydia O
was O
Lydia O
still O
; O
untamed O
, O
unabashed O
, O
wild O
, O
noisy O
, O
and O
fearless O
. O
She O
turned O
from O
sister O
to O
sister O
, O
demanding O
their O
congratulations O
, O
and O
when O
at O
length O
they O
all O
sat O
down O
, O
looked O
eagerly O
round O
the O
room O
, O
took O
notice O
of O
some O
little O
alteration O
in O
it O
, O
and O
observed O
, O
with O
a O
laugh O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
great O
while O
since O
she O
had O
been O
there O
. O
Wickham O
was O
not O
at O
all O
more O
distressed O
than O
herself O
, O
but O
his O
manners O
were O
always O
so O
pleasing O
, O
that O
had O
his O
character O
and O
his O
marriage O
been O
exactly O
what O
they O
ought O
, O
his O
smiles O
and O
his O
easy O
address O
, O
while O
he O
claimed O
their O
relationship O
, O
would O
have O
delighted O
them O
all O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
not O
before O
believed O
him O
quite O
equal O
to O
such O
assurance O
; O
but O
she O
sat O
down O
, O
resolving O
within O
herself O
, O
to O
draw O
no O
limits O
in O
future O
to O
the O
impudence O
of O
an O
impudent O
man O
. O
_She_ O
blushed O
, O
and O
Jane O
blushed O
; O
but O
the O
cheeks O
of O
the O
two O
who O
caused O
their O
confusion O
, O
suffered O
no O
variation O
of O
colour O
. O
There O
was O
no O
want O
of O
discourse O
. O
The O
bride O
and O
her O
mother O
could O
neither O
of O
them O
talk O
fast O
enough O
; O
and O
Wickham O
, O
who O
happened O
to O
sit O
near O
Elizabeth O
, O
began O
enquiring O
after O
his O
acquaintance O
in O
that O
neighbourhood O
, O
with O
a O
good O
humoured O
ease O
, O
which O
she O
felt O
very O
unable O
to O
equal O
in O
her O
replies O
. O
They O
seemed O
each O
of O
them O
to O
have O
the O
happiest O
memories O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Nothing O
of O
the O
past O
was O
recollected O
with O
pain O
; O
and O
Lydia O
led O
voluntarily O
to O
subjects O
, O
which O
her O
sisters O
would O
not O
have O
alluded O
to O
for O
the O
world O
. O
" O
Only O
think O
of O
its O
being O
three O
months O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
, O
" O
since O
I O
went O
away O
; O
it O
seems O
but O
a O
fortnight O
I O
declare O
; O
and O
yet O
there O
have O
been O
things O
enough O
happened O
in O
the O
time O
. O
Good O
gracious O
! O
when O
I O
went O
away O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
had O
no O
more O
idea O
of O
being O
married O
till O
I O
came O
back O
again O
! O
though O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
very O
good O
fun O
if O
I O
was O
. O
" O
Her O
father O
lifted O
up O
his O
eyes O
. O
Jane O
was O
distressed O
. O
Elizabeth O
looked O
expressively O
at O
Lydia O
; O
but O
she O
, O
who O
never O
heard O
nor O
saw O
any O
thing O
of O
which O
she O
chose O
to O
be O
insensible O
, O
gaily O
continued O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
mamma O
, O
do O
the O
people O
here O
abouts O
know O
I O
am O
married O
to-day O
? O
I O
was O
afraid O
they O
might O
not O
; O
and O
we O
overtook O
William O
Goulding O
in O
his O
curricle O
, O
so O
I O
was O
determined O
he O
should O
know O
it O
, O
and O
so O
I O
let O
down O
the O
side O
glass O
next O
to O
him O
, O
and O
took O
off O
my O
glove O
, O
and O
let O
my O
hand O
just O
rest O
upon O
the O
window O
frame O
, O
so O
that O
he O
might O
see O
the O
ring O
, O
and O
then O
I O
bowed O
and O
smiled O
like O
any O
thing O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
bear O
it O
no O
longer O
. O
She O
got O
up O
, O
and O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
room O
; O
and O
returned O
no O
more O
, O
till O
she O
heard O
them O
passing O
through O
the O
hall O
to O
the O
dining-parlour O
. O
She O
then O
joined O
them O
soon O
enough O
to O
see O
Lydia O
, O
with O
anxious O
parade O
, O
walk O
up O
to O
her O
mother O
's O
right O
hand O
, O
and O
hear O
her O
say O
to O
her O
eldest O
sister O
, O
" O
Ah O
! O
Jane O
, O
I O
take O
your O
place O
now O
, O
and O
you O
must O
go O
lower O
, O
because O
I O
am O
a O
married O
woman O
. O
" O
It O
was O
not O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
time O
would O
give O
Lydia O
that O
embarrassment O
, O
from O
which O
she O
had O
been O
so O
wholly O
free O
at O
first O
. O
Her O
ease O
and O
good O
spirits O
increased O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
see O
Mrs. O
Philips O
, O
the O
Lucases O
, O
and O
all O
their O
other O
neighbours O
, O
and O
to O
hear O
herself O
called O
" O
Mrs. O
Wickham O
, O
" O
by O
each O
of O
them O
; O
and O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
she O
went O
after O
dinner O
to O
shew O
her O
ring O
and O
boast O
of O
being O
married O
, O
to O
Mrs. O
Hill O
and O
the O
two O
housemaids O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
mamma O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
when O
they O
were O
all O
returned O
to O
the O
breakfast O
room O
, O
" O
and O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
my O
husband O
? O
Is O
not O
he O
a O
charming O
man O
? O
I O
am O
sure O
my O
sisters O
must O
all O
envy O
me O
. O
I O
only O
hope O
they O
may O
have O
half O
my O
good O
luck O
. O
They O
must O
all O
go O
to O
Brighton O
. O
That O
is O
the O
place O
to O
get O
husbands O
. O
What O
a O
pity O
it O
is O
, O
mamma O
, O
we O
did O
not O
all O
go O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
true O
; O
and O
if O
I O
had O
my O
will O
, O
we O
should O
. O
But O
my O
dear O
Lydia O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
at O
all O
like O
your O
going O
such O
a O
way O
off O
. O
Must O
it O
be O
so O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
lord O
! O
yes O
; O
-- O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
that O
. O
I O
shall O
like O
it O
of O
all O
things O
. O
You O
and O
papa O
, O
and O
my O
sisters O
, O
must O
come O
down O
and O
see O
us O
. O
We O
shall O
be O
at O
Newcastle O
all O
the O
winter O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
there O
will O
be O
some O
balls O
, O
and O
I O
will O
take O
care O
to O
get O
good O
partners O
for O
them O
all O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
like O
it O
beyond O
any O
thing O
! O
" O
said O
her O
mother O
. O
" O
And O
then O
when O
you O
go O
away O
, O
you O
may O
leave O
one O
or O
two O
of O
my O
sisters O
behind O
you O
; O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
I O
shall O
get O
husbands O
for O
them O
before O
the O
winter O
is O
over O
. O
" O
" O
I O
thank O
you O
for O
my O
share O
of O
the O
favour O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
but O
I O
do O
not O
particularly O
like O
your O
way O
of O
getting O
husbands O
. O
" O
Their O
visitors O
were O
not O
to O
remain O
above O
ten O
days O
with O
them O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
had O
received O
his O
commission O
before O
he O
left O
London O
, O
and O
he O
was O
to O
join O
his O
regiment O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
fortnight O
. O
No O
one O
but O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
regretted O
that O
their O
stay O
would O
be O
so O
short O
; O
and O
she O
made O
the O
most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
by O
visiting O
about O
with O
her O
daughter O
, O
and O
having O
very O
frequent O
parties O
at O
home O
. O
These O
parties O
were O
acceptable O
to O
all O
; O
to O
avoid O
a O
family O
circle O
was O
even O
more O
desirable O
to O
such O
as O
did O
think O
, O
than O
such O
as O
did O
not O
. O
Wickham O
's O
affection O
for O
Lydia O
, O
was O
just O
what O
Elizabeth O
had O
expected O
to O
find O
it O
; O
not O
equal O
to O
Lydia O
's O
for O
him O
. O
She O
had O
scarcely O
needed O
her O
present O
observation O
to O
be O
satisfied O
, O
from O
the O
reason O
of O
things O
, O
that O
their O
elopement O
had O
been O
brought O
on O
by O
the O
strength O
of O
her O
love O
, O
rather O
than O
by O
his O
; O
and O
she O
would O
have O
wondered O
why O
, O
without O
violently O
caring O
for O
her O
, O
he O
chose O
to O
elope O
with O
her O
at O
all O
, O
had O
she O
not O
felt O
certain O
that O
his O
flight O
was O
rendered O
necessary O
by O
distress O
of O
circumstances O
; O
and O
if O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
he O
was O
not O
the O
young O
man O
to O
resist O
an O
opportunity O
of O
having O
a O
companion O
. O
Lydia O
was O
exceedingly O
fond O
of O
him O
. O
He O
was O
her O
dear O
Wickham O
on O
every O
occasion O
; O
no O
one O
was O
to O
be O
put O
in O
competition O
with O
him O
. O
He O
did O
every O
thing O
best O
in O
the O
world O
; O
and O
she O
was O
sure O
he O
would O
kill O
more O
birds O
on O
the O
first O
of O
September O
, O
than O
any O
body O
else O
in O
the O
country O
. O
One O
morning O
, O
soon O
after O
their O
arrival O
, O
as O
she O
was O
sitting O
with O
her O
two O
elder O
sisters O
, O
she O
said O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
I O
never O
gave O
_you_ O
an O
account O
of O
my O
wedding O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
You O
were O
not O
by O
, O
when O
I O
told O
mamma O
, O
and O
the O
others O
, O
all O
about O
it O
. O
Are O
not O
you O
curious O
to O
hear O
how O
it O
was O
managed O
? O
" O
" O
No O
really O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
I O
think O
there O
can O
not O
be O
too O
little O
said O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
" O
" O
La O
! O
You O
are O
so O
strange O
! O
But O
I O
must O
tell O
you O
how O
it O
went O
off O
. O
We O
were O
married O
, O
you O
know O
, O
at O
St. O
Clement O
's O
, O
because O
Wickham O
's O
lodgings O
were O
in O
that O
parish O
. O
And O
it O
was O
settled O
that O
we O
should O
all O
be O
there O
by O
eleven O
o'clock O
. O
My O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
and O
I O
were O
to O
go O
together O
; O
and O
the O
others O
were O
to O
meet O
us O
at O
the O
church O
. O
Well O
, O
Monday O
morning O
came O
, O
and O
I O
was O
in O
such O
a O
fuss O
! O
I O
was O
so O
afraid O
you O
know O
that O
something O
would O
happen O
to O
put O
it O
off O
, O
and O
then O
I O
should O
have O
gone O
quite O
distracted O
. O
And O
there O
was O
my O
aunt O
, O
all O
the O
time O
I O
was O
dressing O
, O
preaching O
and O
talking O
away O
just O
as O
if O
she O
was O
reading O
a O
sermon O
. O
However O
, O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
above O
one O
word O
in O
ten O
, O
for O
I O
was O
thinking O
, O
you O
may O
suppose O
, O
of O
my O
dear O
Wickham O
. O
I O
longed O
to O
know O
whether O
he O
would O
be O
married O
in O
his O
blue O
coat O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
and O
so O
we O
breakfasted O
at O
ten O
as O
usual O
; O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
never O
be O
over O
; O
for O
, O
by O
the O
bye O
, O
you O
are O
to O
understand O
, O
that O
my O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
were O
horrid O
unpleasant O
all O
the O
time O
I O
was O
with O
them O
. O
If O
you O
'll O
believe O
me O
, O
I O
did O
not O
once O
put O
my O
foot O
out O
of O
doors O
, O
though O
I O
was O
there O
a O
fortnight O
. O
Not O
one O
party O
, O
or O
scheme O
, O
or O
any O
thing O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
London O
was O
rather O
thin O
, O
but O
however O
the O
little O
Theatre O
was O
open O
. O
Well O
, O
and O
so O
just O
as O
the O
carriage O
came O
to O
the O
door O
, O
my O
uncle O
was O
called O
away O
upon O
business O
to O
that O
horrid O
man O
Mr. O
Stone O
. O
And O
then O
, O
you O
know O
, O
when O
once O
they O
get O
together O
, O
there O
is O
no O
end O
of O
it O
. O
Well O
, O
I O
was O
so O
frightened O
I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
to O
do O
, O
for O
my O
uncle O
was O
to O
give O
me O
away O
; O
and O
if O
we O
were O
beyond O
the O
hour O
, O
we O
could O
not O
be O
married O
all O
day O
. O
But O
, O
luckily O
, O
he O
came O
back O
again O
in O
ten O
minutes O
time O
, O
and O
then O
we O
all O
set O
out O
. O
However O
, O
I O
recollected O
afterwards O
, O
that O
if O
he O
_had_ O
been O
prevented O
going O
, O
the O
wedding O
need O
not O
be O
put O
off O
, O
for O
Mr. O
Darcy O
might O
have O
done O
as O
well O
. O
" O
" O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
! O
" O
repeated O
Elizabeth O
, O
in O
utter O
amazement O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
yes O
! O
-- O
he O
was O
to O
come O
there O
with O
Wickham O
, O
you O
know O
. O
But O
gracious O
me O
! O
I O
quite O
forgot O
! O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
have O
said O
a O
word O
about O
it O
. O
I O
promised O
them O
so O
faithfully O
! O
What O
will O
Wickham O
say O
? O
It O
was O
to O
be O
such O
a O
secret O
! O
" O
" O
If O
it O
was O
to O
be O
secret O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
, O
" O
say O
not O
another O
word O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
You O
may O
depend O
upon O
my O
seeking O
no O
further O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
certainly O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
though O
burning O
with O
curiosity O
; O
" O
we O
will O
ask O
you O
no O
questions O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
, O
" O
said O
Lydia O
, O
" O
for O
if O
you O
did O
, O
I O
should O
certainly O
tell O
you O
all O
, O
and O
then O
Wickham O
would O
be O
angry O
. O
" O
On O
such O
encouragement O
to O
ask O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
forced O
to O
put O
it O
out O
of O
her O
power O
, O
by O
running O
away O
. O
But O
to O
live O
in O
ignorance O
on O
such O
a O
point O
was O
impossible O
; O
or O
at O
least O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
try O
for O
information O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
been O
at O
her O
sister O
's O
wedding O
. O
It O
was O
exactly O
a O
scene O
, O
and O
exactly O
among O
people O
, O
where O
he O
had O
apparently O
least O
to O
do O
, O
and O
least O
temptation O
to O
go O
. O
Conjectures O
as O
to O
the O
meaning O
of O
it O
, O
rapid O
and O
wild O
, O
hurried O
into O
her O
brain O
; O
but O
she O
was O
satisfied O
with O
none O
. O
Those O
that O
best O
pleased O
her O
, O
as O
placing O
his O
conduct O
in O
the O
noblest O
light O
, O
seemed O
most O
improbable O
. O
She O
could O
not O
bear O
such O
suspense O
; O
and O
hastily O
seizing O
a O
sheet O
of O
paper O
, O
wrote O
a O
short O
letter O
to O
her O
aunt O
, O
to O
request O
an O
explanation O
of O
what O
Lydia O
had O
dropt O
, O
if O
it O
were O
compatible O
with O
the O
secrecy O
which O
had O
been O
intended O
. O
" O
You O
may O
readily O
comprehend O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
what O
my O
curiosity O
must O
be O
to O
know O
how O
a O
person O
unconnected O
with O
any O
of O
us O
, O
and O
( O
comparatively O
speaking O
) O
a O
stranger O
to O
our O
family O
, O
should O
have O
been O
amongst O
you O
at O
such O
a O
time O
. O
Pray O
write O
instantly O
, O
and O
let O
me O
understand O
it O
-- O
unless O
it O
is O
, O
for O
very O
cogent O
reasons O
, O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
secrecy O
which O
Lydia O
seems O
to O
think O
necessary O
; O
and O
then O
I O
must O
endeavour O
to O
be O
satisfied O
with O
ignorance O
. O
" O
" O
Not O
that O
I O
_shall_ O
though O
, O
" O
she O
added O
to O
herself O
, O
as O
she O
finished O
the O
letter O
; O
" O
and O
my O
dear O
aunt O
, O
if O
you O
do O
not O
tell O
me O
in O
an O
honourable O
manner O
, O
I O
shall O
certainly O
be O
reduced O
to O
tricks O
and O
stratagems O
to O
find O
it O
out O
. O
" O
Jane O
's O
delicate O
sense O
of O
honour O
would O
not O
allow O
her O
to O
speak O
to O
Elizabeth O
privately O
of O
what O
Lydia O
had O
let O
fall O
; O
Elizabeth O
was O
glad O
of O
it O
; O
-- O
till O
it O
appeared O
whether O
her O
inquiries O
would O
receive O
any O
satisfaction O
, O
she O
had O
rather O
be O
without O
a O
confidante O
. O
