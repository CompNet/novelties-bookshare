As O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
gone O
, O
Elizabeth O
walked O
out O
to O
recover O
her O
spirits O
; O
or O
in O
other O
words O
, O
to O
dwell O
without O
interruption O
on O
those O
subjects O
that O
must O
deaden O
them O
more O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
behaviour O
astonished O
and O
vexed O
her O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
if O
he O
came O
only O
to O
be O
silent O
, O
grave O
, O
and O
indifferent O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
did O
he O
come O
at O
all O
? O
" O
She O
could O
settle O
it O
in O
no O
way O
that O
gave O
her O
pleasure O
. O
" O
He O
could O
be O
still O
amiable O
, O
still O
pleasing O
, O
to O
my O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
when O
he O
was O
in O
town O
; O
and O
why O
not O
to O
me O
? O
If O
he O
fears O
me O
, O
why O
come O
hither O
? O
If O
he O
no O
longer O
cares O
for O
me O
, O
why O
silent O
? O
Teazing O
, O
teazing O
, O
man O
! O
I O
will O
think O
no O
more O
about O
him O
. O
" O
Her O
resolution O
was O
for O
a O
short O
time O
involuntarily O
kept O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
who O
joined O
her O
with O
a O
cheerful O
look O
, O
which O
shewed O
her O
better O
satisfied O
with O
their O
visitors O
, O
than O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
that O
this O
first O
meeting O
is O
over O
, O
I O
feel O
perfectly O
easy O
. O
I O
know O
my O
own O
strength O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
never O
be O
embarrassed O
again O
by O
his O
coming O
. O
I O
am O
glad O
he O
dines O
here O
on O
Tuesday O
. O
It O
will O
then O
be O
publicly O
seen O
, O
that O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
we O
meet O
only O
as O
common O
and O
indifferent O
acquaintance O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
very O
indifferent O
indeed O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
laughingly O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Jane O
, O
take O
care O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Lizzy O
, O
you O
can O
not O
think O
me O
so O
weak O
, O
as O
to O
be O
in O
danger O
now O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
you O
are O
in O
very O
great O
danger O
of O
making O
him O
as O
much O
in O
love O
with O
you O
as O
ever O
. O
" O
* O
* O

They O
did O
not O
see O
the O
gentlemen O
again O
till O
Tuesday O
; O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
in O
the O
meanwhile O
, O
was O
giving O
way O
to O
all O
the O
happy O
schemes O
, O
which O
the O
good O
humour O
, O
and O
common O
politeness O
of O
Bingley O
, O
in O
half O
an O
hour O
's O
visit O
, O
had O
revived O
. O
On O
Tuesday O
there O
was O
a O
large O
party O
assembled O
at O
Longbourn O
; O
and O
the O
two O
, O
who O
were O
most O
anxiously O
expected O
, O
to O
the O
credit O
of O
their O
punctuality O
as O
sportsmen O
, O
were O
in O
very O
good O
time O
. O
When O
they O
repaired O
to O
the O
dining-room O
, O
Elizabeth O
eagerly O
watched O
to O
see O
whether O
Bingley O
would O
take O
the O
place O
, O
which O
, O
in O
all O
their O
former O
parties O
, O
had O
belonged O
to O
him O
, O
by O
her O
sister O
. O
Her O
prudent O
mother O
, O
occupied O
by O
the O
same O
ideas O
, O
forbore O
to O
invite O
him O
to O
sit O
by O
herself O
. O
On O
entering O
the O
room O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
hesitate O
; O
but O
Jane O
happened O
to O
look O
round O
, O
and O
happened O
to O
smile O
: O
it O
was O
decided O
. O
He O
placed O
himself O
by O
her O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
with O
a O
triumphant O
sensation O
, O
looked O
towards O
his O
friend O
. O
He O
bore O
it O
with O
noble O
indifference O
, O
and O
she O
would O
have O
imagined O
that O
Bingley O
had O
received O
his O
sanction O
to O
be O
happy O
, O
had O
she O
not O
seen O
his O
eyes O
likewise O
turned O
towards O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
half-laughing O
alarm O
. O
His O
behaviour O
to O
her O
sister O
was O
such O
, O
during O
dinner O
time O
, O
as O
shewed O
an O
admiration O
of O
her O
, O
which O
, O
though O
more O
guarded O
than O
formerly O
, O
persuaded O
Elizabeth O
, O
that O
if O
left O
wholly O
to O
himself O
, O
Jane O
's O
happiness O
, O
and O
his O
own O
, O
would O
be O
speedily O
secured O
. O
Though O
she O
dared O
not O
depend O
upon O
the O
consequence O
, O
she O
yet O
received O
pleasure O
from O
observing O
his O
behaviour O
. O
It O
gave O
her O
all O
the O
animation O
that O
her O
spirits O
could O
boast O
; O
for O
she O
was O
in O
no O
cheerful O
humour O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
almost O
as O
far O
from O
her O
, O
as O
the O
table O
could O
divide O
them O
. O
He O
was O
on O
one O
side O
of O
her O
mother O
. O
She O
knew O
how O
little O
such O
a O
situation O
would O
give O
pleasure O
to O
either O
, O
or O
make O
either O
appear O
to O
advantage O
. O
She O
was O
not O
near O
enough O
to O
hear O
any O
of O
their O
discourse O
, O
but O
she O
could O
see O
how O
seldom O
they O
spoke O
to O
each O
other O
, O
and O
how O
formal O
and O
cold O
was O
their O
manner O
, O
whenever O
they O
did O
. O
Her O
mother O
's O
ungraciousness O
, O
made O
the O
sense O
of O
what O
they O
owed O
him O
more O
painful O
to O
Elizabeth O
's O
mind O
; O
and O
she O
would O
, O
at O
times O
, O
have O
given O
any O
thing O
to O
be O
privileged O
to O
tell O
him O
, O
that O
his O
kindness O
was O
neither O
unknown O
nor O
unfelt O
by O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
family O
. O
She O
was O
in O
hopes O
that O
the O
evening O
would O
afford O
some O
opportunity O
of O
bringing O
them O
together O
; O
that O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
visit O
would O
not O
pass O
away O
without O
enabling O
them O
to O
enter O
into O
something O
more O
of O
conversation O
, O
than O
the O
mere O
ceremonious O
salutation O
attending O
his O
entrance O
. O
Anxious O
and O
uneasy O
, O
the O
period O
which O
passed O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
before O
the O
gentlemen O
came O
, O
was O
wearisome O
and O
dull O
to O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
almost O
made O
her O
uncivil O
. O
She O
looked O
forward O
to O
their O
entrance O
, O
as O
the O
point O
on O
which O
all O
her O
chance O
of O
pleasure O
for O
the O
evening O
must O
depend O
. O
" O
If O
he O
does O
not O
come O
to O
me O
, O
_then_ O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
give O
him O
up O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
The O
gentlemen O
came O
; O
and O
she O
thought O
he O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
would O
have O
answered O
her O
hopes O
; O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
the O
ladies O
had O
crowded O
round O
the O
table O
, O
where O
Miss O
Bennet O
was O
making O
tea O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
pouring O
out O
the O
coffee O
, O
in O
so O
close O
a O
confederacy O
, O
that O
there O
was O
not O
a O
single O
vacancy O
near O
her O
, O
which O
would O
admit O
of O
a O
chair O
. O
And O
on O
the O
gentlemen O
's O
approaching O
, O
one O
of O
the O
girls O
moved O
closer O
to O
her O
than O
ever O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
a O
whisper O
, O
" O
The O
men O
sha O
n't O
come O
and O
part O
us O
, O
I O
am O
determined O
. O
We O
want O
none O
of O
them O
; O
do O
we O
? O
" O
Darcy O
had O
walked O
away O
to O
another O
part O
of O
the O
room O
. O
She O
followed O
him O
with O
her O
eyes O
, O
envied O
every O
one O
to O
whom O
he O
spoke O
, O
had O
scarcely O
patience O
enough O
to O
help O
anybody O
to O
coffee O
; O
and O
then O
was O
enraged O
against O
herself O
for O
being O
so O
silly O
! O
" O
A O
man O
who O
has O
once O
been O
refused O
! O
How O
could O
I O
ever O
be O
foolish O
enough O
to O
expect O
a O
renewal O
of O
his O
love O
? O
Is O
there O
one O
among O
the O
sex O
, O
who O
would O
not O
protest O
against O
such O
a O
weakness O
as O
a O
second O
proposal O
to O
the O
same O
woman O
? O
There O
is O
no O
indignity O
so O
abhorrent O
to O
their O
feelings O
! O
" O
She O
was O
a O
little O
revived O
, O
however O
, O
by O
his O
bringing O
back O
his O
coffee O
cup O
himself O
; O
and O
she O
seized O
the O
opportunity O
of O
saying O
, O
" O
Is O
your O
sister O
at O
Pemberley O
still O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
she O
will O
remain O
there O
till O
Christmas O
. O
" O
" O
And O
quite O
alone O
? O
Have O
all O
her O
friends O
left O
her O
? O
" O
" O
Mrs. O
Annesley O
is O
with O
her O
. O
The O
others O
have O
been O
gone O
on O
to O
Scarborough O
, O
these O
three O
weeks O
. O
" O
She O
could O
think O
of O
nothing O
more O
to O
say O
; O
but O
if O
he O
wished O
to O
converse O
with O
her O
, O
he O
might O
have O
better O
success O
. O
He O
stood O
by O
her O
, O
however O
, O
for O
some O
minutes O
, O
in O
silence O
; O
and O
, O
at O
last O
, O
on O
the O
young O
lady O
's O
whispering O
to O
Elizabeth O
again O
, O
he O
walked O
away O
. O
When O
the O
tea-things O
were O
removed O
, O
and O
the O
card O
tables O
placed O
, O
the O
ladies O
all O
rose O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
then O
hoping O
to O
be O
soon O
joined O
by O
him O
, O
when O
all O
her O
views O
were O
overthrown O
, O
by O
seeing O
him O
fall O
a O
victim O
to O
her O
mother O
's O
rapacity O
for O
whist O
players O
, O
and O
in O
a O
few O
moments O
after O
seated O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
party O
. O
She O
now O
lost O
every O
expectation O
of O
pleasure O
. O
They O
were O
confined O
for O
the O
evening O
at O
different O
tables O
, O
and O
she O
had O
nothing O
to O
hope O
, O
but O
that O
his O
eyes O
were O
so O
often O
turned O
towards O
her O
side O
of O
the O
room O
, O
as O
to O
make O
him O
play O
as O
unsuccessfully O
as O
herself O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
designed O
to O
keep O
the O
two O
Netherfield O
gentlemen O
to O
supper O
; O
but O
their O
carriage O
was O
unluckily O
ordered O
before O
any O
of O
the O
others O
, O
and O
she O
had O
no O
opportunity O
of O
detaining O
them O
. O
" O
Well O
girls O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
left O
to O
themselves O
, O
" O
What O
say O
you O
to O
the O
day O
? O
I O
think O
every O
thing O
has O
passed O
off O
uncommonly O
well O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
. O
The O
dinner O
was O
as O
well O
dressed O
as O
any O
I O
ever O
saw O
. O
The O
venison O
was O
roasted O
to O
a O
turn O
-- O
and O
everybody O
said O
, O
they O
never O
saw O
so O
fat O
a O
haunch O
. O
The O
soup O
was O
fifty O
times O
better O
than O
what O
we O
had O
at O
the O
Lucas O
's O
last O
week O
; O
and O
even O
Mr. O
Darcy O
acknowledged O
, O
that O
the O
partridges O
were O
remarkably O
well O
done O
; O
and O
I O
suppose O
he O
has O
two O
or O
three O
French O
cooks O
at O
least O
. O
And O
, O
my O
dear O
Jane O
, O
I O
never O
saw O
you O
look O
in O
greater O
beauty O
. O
Mrs. O
Long O
said O
so O
too O
, O
for O
I O
asked O
her O
whether O
you O
did O
not O
. O
And O
what O
do O
you O
think O
she O
said O
besides O
? O
'Ah O
! O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
we O
shall O
have O
her O
at O
Netherfield O
at O
last O
. O
' O
She O
did O
indeed O
. O
I O
do O
think O
Mrs. O
Long O
is O
as O
good O
a O
creature O
as O
ever O
lived O
-- O
and O
her O
nieces O
are O
very O
pretty O
behaved O
girls O
, O
and O
not O
at O
all O
handsome O
: O
I O
like O
them O
prodigiously O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
in O
short O
, O
was O
in O
very O
great O
spirits O
; O
she O
had O
seen O
enough O
of O
Bingley O
's O
behaviour O
to O
Jane O
, O
to O
be O
convinced O
that O
she O
would O
get O
him O
at O
last O
; O
and O
her O
expectations O
of O
advantage O
to O
her O
family O
, O
when O
in O
a O
happy O
humour O
, O
were O
so O
far O
beyond O
reason O
, O
that O
she O
was O
quite O
disappointed O
at O
not O
seeing O
him O
there O
again O
the O
next O
day O
, O
to O
make O
his O
proposals O
. O
" O
It O
has O
been O
a O
very O
agreeable O
day O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bennet O
to O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
The O
party O
seemed O
so O
well O
selected O
, O
so O
suitable O
one O
with O
the O
other O
. O
I O
hope O
we O
may O
often O
meet O
again O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
smiled O
. O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
you O
must O
not O
do O
so O
. O
You O
must O
not O
suspect O
me O
. O
It O
mortifies O
me O
. O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
I O
have O
now O
learnt O
to O
enjoy O
his O
conversation O
as O
an O
agreeable O
and O
sensible O
young O
man O
, O
without O
having O
a O
wish O
beyond O
it O
. O
I O
am O
perfectly O
satisfied O
from O
what O
his O
manners O
now O
are O
, O
that O
he O
never O
had O
any O
design O
of O
engaging O
my O
affection O
. O
It O
is O
only O
that O
he O
is O
blessed O
with O
greater O
sweetness O
of O
address O
, O
and O
a O
stronger O
desire O
of O
generally O
pleasing O
than O
any O
other O
man O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
very O
cruel O
, O
" O
said O
her O
sister O
, O
" O
you O
will O
not O
let O
me O
smile O
, O
and O
are O
provoking O
me O
to O
it O
every O
moment O
. O
" O
" O
How O
hard O
it O
is O
in O
some O
cases O
to O
be O
believed O
! O
" O
" O
And O
how O
impossible O
in O
others O
! O
" O
" O
But O
why O
should O
you O
wish O
to O
persuade O
me O
that O
I O
feel O
more O
than O
I O
acknowledge O
? O
" O
" O
That O
is O
a O
question O
which O
I O
hardly O
know O
how O
to O
answer O
. O
We O
all O
love O
to O
instruct O
, O
though O
we O
can O
teach O
only O
what O
is O
not O
worth O
knowing O
. O
Forgive O
me O
; O
and O
if O
you O
persist O
in O
indifference O
, O
do O
not O
make O
_me_ O
your O
confidante O
. O
