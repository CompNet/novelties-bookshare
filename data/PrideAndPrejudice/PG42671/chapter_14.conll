During O
dinner O
, O
Mr. O
Bennet O
scarcely O
spoke O
at O
all O
; O
but O
when O
the O
servants O
were O
withdrawn O
, O
he O
thought O
it O
time O
to O
have O
some O
conversation O
with O
his O
guest O
, O
and O
therefore O
started O
a O
subject O
in O
which O
he O
expected O
him O
to O
shine O
, O
by O
observing O
that O
he O
seemed O
very O
fortunate O
in O
his O
patroness O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
's O
attention O
to O
his O
wishes O
, O
and O
consideration O
for O
his O
comfort O
, O
appeared O
very O
remarkable O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
could O
not O
have O
chosen O
better O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
eloquent O
in O
her O
praise O
. O
The O
subject O
elevated O
him O
to O
more O
than O
usual O
solemnity O
of O
manner O
, O
and O
with O
a O
most O
important O
aspect O
he O
protested O
that O
he O
had O
never O
in O
his O
life O
witnessed O
such O
behaviour O
in O
a O
person O
of O
rank O
-- O
such O
affability O
and O
condescension O
, O
as O
he O
had O
himself O
experienced O
from O
Lady O
Catherine O
. O
She O
had O
been O
graciously O
pleased O
to O
approve O
of O
both O
the O
discourses O
, O
which O
he O
had O
already O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
preaching O
before O
her O
. O
She O
had O
also O
asked O
him O
twice O
to O
dine O
at O
Rosings O
, O
and O
had O
sent O
for O
him O
only O
the O
Saturday O
before O
, O
to O
make O
up O
her O
pool O
of O
quadrille O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
was O
reckoned O
proud O
by O
many O
people O
he O
knew O
, O
but O
_he_ O
had O
never O
seen O
any O
thing O
but O
affability O
in O
her O
. O
She O
had O
always O
spoken O
to O
him O
as O
she O
would O
to O
any O
other O
gentleman O
; O
she O
made O
not O
the O
smallest O
objection O
to O
his O
joining O
in O
the O
society O
of O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
nor O
to O
his O
leaving O
his O
parish O
occasionally O
for O
a O
week O
or O
two O
, O
to O
visit O
his O
relations O
. O
She O
had O
even O
condescended O
to O
advise O
him O
to O
marry O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
could O
, O
provided O
he O
chose O
with O
discretion O
; O
and O
had O
once O
paid O
him O
a O
visit O
in O
his O
humble O
parsonage O
; O
where O
she O
had O
perfectly O
approved O
all O
the O
alterations O
he O
had O
been O
making O
, O
and O
had O
even O
vouchsafed O
to O
suggest O
some O
herself O
, O
-- O
some O
shelves O
in O
the O
closets O
up O
stairs O
. O
" O
That O
is O
all O
very O
proper O
and O
civil O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
" O
said O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
is O
a O
very O
agreeable O
woman O
. O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
that O
great O
ladies O
in O
general O
are O
not O
more O
like O
her O
. O
Does O
she O
live O
near O
you O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
" O
The O
garden O
in O
which O
stands O
my O
humble O
abode O
, O
is O
separated O
only O
by O
a O
lane O
from O
Rosings O
Park O
, O
her O
ladyship O
's O
residence O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
you O
said O
she O
was O
a O
widow O
, O
sir O
? O
has O
she O
any O
family O
? O
" O
" O
She O
has O
one O
only O
daughter O
, O
the O
heiress O
of O
Rosings O
, O
and O
of O
very O
extensive O
property O
. O
" O
" O
Ah O
! O
" O
cried O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
shaking O
her O
head O
, O
" O
then O
she O
is O
better O
off O
than O
many O
girls O
. O
And O
what O
sort O
of O
young O
lady O
is O
she O
? O
is O
she O
handsome O
? O
" O
" O
She O
is O
a O
most O
charming O
young O
lady O
indeed O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
herself O
says O
that O
in O
point O
of O
true O
beauty O
, O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
is O
far O
superior O
to O
the O
handsomest O
of O
her O
sex O
; O
because O
there O
is O
that O
in O
her O
features O
which O
marks O
the O
young O
woman O
of O
distinguished O
birth O
. O
She O
is O
unfortunately O
of O
a O
sickly O
constitution O
, O
which O
has O
prevented O
her O
making O
that O
progress O
in O
many O
accomplishments O
, O
which O
she O
could O
not O
otherwise O
have O
failed O
of O
; O
as O
I O
am O
informed O
by O
the O
lady O
who O
superintended O
her O
education O
, O
and O
who O
still O
resides O
with O
them O
. O
But O
she O
is O
perfectly O
amiable O
, O
and O
often O
condescends O
to O
drive O
by O
my O
humble O
abode O
in O
her O
little O
phaeton O
and O
ponies O
. O
" O
" O
Has O
she O
been O
presented O
? O
I O
do O
not O
remember O
her O
name O
among O
the O
ladies O
at O
court O
. O
" O
" O
Her O
indifferent O
state O
of O
health O
unhappily O
prevents O
her O
being O
in O
town O
; O
and O
by O
that O
means O
, O
as O
I O
told O
Lady O
Catherine O
myself O
one O
day O
, O
has O
deprived O
the O
British O
court O
of O
its O
brightest O
ornament O
. O
Her O
ladyship O
seemed O
pleased O
with O
the O
idea O
, O
and O
you O
may O
imagine O
that O
I O
am O
happy O
on O
every O
occasion O
to O
offer O
those O
little O
delicate O
compliments O
which O
are O
always O
acceptable O
to O
ladies O
. O
I O
have O
more O
than O
once O
observed O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
that O
her O
charming O
daughter O
seemed O
born O
to O
be O
a O
duchess O
, O
and O
that O
the O
most O
elevated O
rank O
, O
instead O
of O
giving O
her O
consequence O
, O
would O
be O
adorned O
by O
her. O
-- O
These O
are O
the O
kind O
of O
little O
things O
which O
please O
her O
ladyship O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
attention O
which O
I O
conceive O
myself O
peculiarly O
bound O
to O
pay O
. O
" O
" O
You O
judge O
very O
properly O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
and O
it O
is O
happy O
for O
you O
that O
you O
possess O
the O
talent O
of O
flattering O
with O
delicacy O
. O
May O
I O
ask O
whether O
these O
pleasing O
attentions O
proceed O
from O
the O
impulse O
of O
the O
moment O
, O
or O
are O
the O
result O
of O
previous O
study O
? O
" O
" O
They O
arise O
chiefly O
from O
what O
is O
passing O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
though O
I O
sometimes O
amuse O
myself O
with O
suggesting O
and O
arranging O
such O
little O
elegant O
compliments O
as O
may O
be O
adapted O
to O
ordinary O
occasions O
, O
I O
always O
wish O
to O
give O
them O
as O
unstudied O
an O
air O
as O
possible O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
expectations O
were O
fully O
answered O
. O
His O
cousin O
was O
as O
absurd O
as O
he O
had O
hoped O
, O
and O
he O
listened O
to O
him O
with O
the O
keenest O
enjoyment O
, O
maintaining O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
most O
resolute O
composure O
of O
countenance O
, O
and O
except O
in O
an O
occasional O
glance O
at O
Elizabeth O
, O
requiring O
no O
partner O
in O
his O
pleasure O
. O
By O
tea-time O
however O
the O
dose O
had O
been O
enough O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Bennet O
was O
glad O
to O
take O
his O
guest O
into O
the O
drawing-room O
again O
, O
and O
when O
tea O
was O
over O
, O
glad O
to O
invite O
him O
to O
read O
aloud O
to O
the O
ladies O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
readily O
assented O
, O
and O
a O
book O
was O
produced O
; O
but O
on O
beholding O
it O
, O
( O
for O
every O
thing O
announced O
it O
to O
be O
from O
a O
circulating O
library O
, O
) O
he O
started O
back O
, O
and O
begging O
pardon O
, O
protested O
that O
he O
never O
read O
novels. O
-- O
Kitty O
stared O
at O
him O
, O
and O
Lydia O
exclaimed. O
-- O
Other O
books O
were O
produced O
, O
and O
after O
some O
deliberation O
he O
chose O
Fordyce O
's O
Sermons O
. O
Lydia O
gaped O
as O
he O
opened O
the O
volume O
, O
and O
before O
he O
had O
, O
with O
very O
monotonous O
solemnity O
, O
read O
three O
pages O
, O
she O
interrupted O
him O
with O
, O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
mama O
, O
that O
my O
uncle O
Philips O
talks O
of O
turning O
away O
Richard O
, O
and O
if O
he O
does O
, O
Colonel O
Forster O
will O
hire O
him O
. O
My O
aunt O
told O
me O
so O
herself O
on O
Saturday O
. O
I O
shall O
walk O
to O
Meryton O
to-morrow O
to O
hear O
more O
about O
it O
, O
and O
to O
ask O
when O
Mr. O
Denny O
comes O
back O
from O
town O
. O
" O
Lydia O
was O
bid O
by O
her O
two O
eldest O
sisters O
to O
hold O
her O
tongue O
; O
but O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
, O
much O
offended O
, O
laid O
aside O
his O
book O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
have O
often O
observed O
how O
little O
young O
ladies O
are O
interested O
by O
books O
of O
a O
serious O
stamp O
, O
though O
written O
solely O
for O
their O
benefit O
. O
It O
amazes O
me O
, O
I O
confess O
; O
-- O
for O
certainly O
, O
there O
can O
be O
nothing O
so O
advantageous O
to O
them O
as O
instruction O
. O
But O
I O
will O
no O
longer O
importune O
my O
young O
cousin O
. O
" O
Then O
turning O
to O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
he O
offered O
himself O
as O
his O
antagonist O
at O
backgammon O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
accepted O
the O
challenge O
, O
observing O
that O
he O
acted O
very O
wisely O
in O
leaving O
the O
girls O
to O
their O
own O
trifling O
amusements O
. O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
and O
her O
daughters O
apologised O
most O
civilly O
for O
Lydia O
's O
interruption O
, O
and O
promised O
that O
it O
should O
not O
occur O
again O
, O
if O
he O
would O
resume O
his O
book O
; O
but O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
after O
assuring O
them O
that O
he O
bore O
his O
young O
cousin O
no O
ill O
will O
, O
and O
should O
never O
resent O
her O
behaviour O
as O
any O
affront O
, O
seated O
himself O
at O
another O
table O
with O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
and O
prepared O
for O
backgammon O
. O
