" O
I O
hope O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
to O
his O
wife O
, O
as O
they O
were O
at O
breakfast O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
" O
that O
you O
have O
ordered O
a O
good O
dinner O
to-day O
, O
because O
I O
have O
reason O
to O
expect O
an O
addition O
to O
our O
family O
party O
. O
" O
" O
Who O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
my O
dear O
? O
I O
know O
of O
nobody O
that O
is O
coming O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
unless O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
should O
happen O
to O
call O
in O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
_my_ O
dinners O
are O
good O
enough O
for O
her O
. O
I O
do O
not O
believe O
she O
often O
sees O
such O
at O
home O
. O
" O
" O
The O
person O
of O
whom O
I O
speak O
, O
is O
a O
gentleman O
and O
a O
stranger O
. O
" O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
's O
eyes O
sparkled. O
-- O
" O
A O
gentleman O
and O
a O
stranger O
! O
It O
is O
Mr. O
Bingley O
I O
am O
sure O
. O
Why O
Jane O
-- O
you O
never O
dropt O
a O
word O
of O
this O
; O
you O
sly O
thing O
! O
Well O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
shall O
be O
extremely O
glad O
to O
see O
Mr O
. O
Bingley. O
-- O
But O
-- O
good O
lord O
! O
how O
unlucky O
! O
there O
is O
not O
a O
bit O
of O
fish O
to O
be O
got O
to-day O
. O
Lydia O
, O
my O
love O
, O
ring O
the O
bell O
. O
I O
must O
speak O
to O
Hill O
, O
this O
moment O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
_not_ O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
" O
said O
her O
husband O
; O
" O
it O
is O
a O
person O
whom O
I O
never O
saw O
in O
the O
whole O
course O
of O
my O
life O
. O
" O
This O
roused O
a O
general O
astonishment O
; O
and O
he O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
being O
eagerly O
questioned O
by O
his O
wife O
and O
five O
daughters O
at O
once O
. O
After O
amusing O
himself O
some O
time O
with O
their O
curiosity O
, O
he O
thus O
explained O
. O
" O
About O
a O
month O
ago O
I O
received O
this O
letter O
, O
and O
about O
a O
fortnight O
ago O
I O
answered O
it O
, O
for O
I O
thought O
it O
a O
case O
of O
some O
delicacy O
, O
and O
requiring O
early O
attention O
. O
It O
is O
from O
my O
cousin O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
who O
, O
when O
I O
am O
dead O
, O
may O
turn O
you O
all O
out O
of O
this O
house O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
pleases O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
, O
" O
cried O
his O
wife O
, O
" O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
hear O
that O
mentioned O
. O
Pray O
do O
not O
talk O
of O
that O
odious O
man O
. O
I O
do O
think O
it O
is O
the O
hardest O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
, O
that O
your O
estate O
should O
be O
entailed O
away O
from O
your O
own O
children O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
if O
I O
had O
been O
you O
, O
I O
should O
have O
tried O
long O
ago O
to O
do O
something O
or O
other O
about O
it O
. O
" O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
attempted O
to O
explain O
to O
her O
the O
nature O
of O
an O
entail O
. O
They O
had O
often O
attempted O
it O
before O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
subject O
on O
which O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
was O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
reason O
; O
and O
she O
continued O
to O
rail O
bitterly O
against O
the O
cruelty O
of O
settling O
an O
estate O
away O
from O
a O
family O
of O
five O
daughters O
, O
in O
favour O
of O
a O
man O
whom O
nobody O
cared O
anything O
about O
. O
" O
It O
certainly O
is O
a O
most O
iniquitous O
affair O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
" O
and O
nothing O
can O
clear O
Mr. O
Collins O
from O
the O
guilt O
of O
inheriting O
Longbourn O
. O
But O
if O
you O
will O
listen O
to O
his O
letter O
, O
you O
may O
perhaps O
be O
a O
little O
softened O
by O
his O
manner O
of O
expressing O
himself O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
shall O
not O
; O
and O
I O
think O
it O
was O
very O
impertinent O
of O
him O
to O
write O
to O
you O
at O
all O
, O
and O
very O
hypocritical O
. O
I O
hate O
such O
false O
friends O
. O
Why O
could O
not O
he O
keep O
on O
quarrelling O
with O
you O
, O
as O
his O
father O
did O
before O
him O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
indeed O
, O
he O
does O
seem O
to O
have O
had O
some O
filial O
scruples O
on O
that O
head O
, O
as O
you O
will O
hear O

DEAR O
SIR O
, O
The O
disagreement O
subsisting O
between O
yourself O
and O
my O
late O
honoured O
father O
, O
always O
gave O
me O
much O
uneasiness O
, O
and O
since O
I O
have O
had O
the O
misfortune O
to O
lose O
him O
, O
I O
have O
frequently O
wished O
to O
heal O
the O
breach O
; O
but O
for O
some O
time O
I O
was O
kept O
back O
by O
my O
own O
doubts O
, O
fearing O
lest O
it O
might O
seem O
disrespectful O
to O
his O
memory O
for O
me O
to O
be O
on O
good O
terms O
with O
any O
one O
, O
with O
whom O
it O
had O
always O
pleased O
him O
to O
be O
at O
variance. O
-- O
" O
There O
, O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
. O
" O
-- O
My O
mind O
however O
is O
now O
made O
up O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
for O
having O
received O
ordination O
at O
Easter O
, O
I O
have O
been O
so O
fortunate O
as O
to O
be O
distinguished O
by O
the O
patronage O
of O
the O
Right O
Honourable O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
widow O
of O
Sir O
Lewis O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
whose O
bounty O
and O
beneficence O
has O
preferred O
me O
to O
the O
valuable O
rectory O
of O
this O
parish O
, O
where O
it O
shall O
be O
my O
earnest O
endeavour O
to O
demean O
myself O
with O
grateful O
respect O
towards O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
and O
be O
ever O
ready O
to O
perform O
those O
rites O
and O
ceremonies O
which O
are O
instituted O
by O
the O
Church O
of O
England O
. O
As O
a O
clergyman O
, O
moreover O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
my O
duty O
to O
promote O
and O
establish O
the O
blessing O
of O
peace O
in O
all O
families O
within O
the O
reach O
of O
my O
influence O
; O
and O
on O
these O
grounds O
I O
flatter O
myself O
that O
my O
present O
overtures O
of O
good-will O
are O
highly O
commendable O
, O
and O
that O
the O
circumstance O
of O
my O
being O
next O
in O
the O
entail O
of O
Longbourn O
estate O
, O
will O
be O
kindly O
overlooked O
on O
your O
side O
, O
and O
not O
lead O
you O
to O
reject O
the O
offered O
olive O
branch O
. O
I O
can O
not O
be O
otherwise O
than O
concerned O
at O
being O
the O
means O
of O
injuring O
your O
amiable O
daughters O
, O
and O
beg O
leave O
to O
apologise O
for O
it O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
assure O
you O
of O
my O
readiness O
to O
make O
them O
every O
possible O
amends O
, O
-- O
but O
of O
this O
hereafter O
. O
If O
you O
should O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
receive O
me O
into O
your O
house O
, O
I O
propose O
myself O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
waiting O
on O
you O
and O
your O
family O
, O
Monday O
, O
November O
18th O
, O
by O
four O
o'clock O
, O
and O
shall O
probably O
trespass O
on O
your O
hospitality O
till O
the O
Saturday O
se'night O
following O
, O
which O
I O
can O
do O
without O
any O
inconvenience O
, O
as O
Lady O
Catherine O
is O
far O
from O
objecting O
to O
my O
occasional O
absence O
on O
a O
Sunday O
, O
provided O
that O
some O
other O
clergyman O
is O
engaged O
to O
do O
the O
duty O
of O
the O
day O
. O
I O
remain O
, O
dear O
sir O
, O
with O
respectful O
compliments O
to O
your O
lady O
and O
daughters O
, O
your O
well-wisher O
and O
friend O
, O
WILLIAM O
COLLINS O
. O
" O
" O
At O
four O
o'clock O
, O
therefore O
, O
we O
may O
expect O
this O
peace-making O
gentleman O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Bennet O
, O
as O
he O
folded O
up O
the O
letter O
. O
" O
He O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
most O
conscientious O
and O
polite O
young O
man O
, O
upon O
my O
word O
; O
and O
I O
doubt O
not O
will O
prove O
a O
valuable O
acquaintance O
, O
especially O
if O
Lady O
Catherine O
should O
be O
so O
indulgent O
as O
to O
let O
him O
come O
to O
us O
again O
. O
" O
" O
There O
is O
some O
sense O
in O
what O
he O
says O
about O
the O
girls O
however O
; O
and O
if O
he O
is O
disposed O
to O
make O
them O
any O
amends O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
be O
the O
person O
to O
discourage O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Though O
it O
is O
difficult O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
, O
" O
to O
guess O
in O
what O
way O
he O
can O
mean O
to O
make O
us O
the O
atonement O
he O
thinks O
our O
due O
, O
the O
wish O
is O
certainly O
to O
his O
credit O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
chiefly O
struck O
with O
his O
extraordinary O
deference O
for O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
and O
his O
kind O
intention O
of O
christening O
, O
marrying O
, O
and O
burying O
his O
parishioners O
whenever O
it O
were O
required O
. O
" O
He O
must O
be O
an O
oddity O
, O
I O
think O
, O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
I O
can O
not O
make O
him O
out. O
-- O
There O
is O
something O
very O
pompous O
in O
his O
style. O
-- O
And O
what O
can O
he O
mean O
by O
apologizing O
for O
being O
next O
in O
the O
entail O
? O
-- O
We O
can O
not O
suppose O
he O
would O
help O
it O
, O
if O
he O
could. O
-- O
Can O
he O
be O
a O
sensible O
man O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
my O
dear O
; O
I O
think O
not O
. O
I O
have O
great O
hopes O
of O
finding O
him O
quite O
the O
reverse O
. O
There O
is O
a O
mixture O
of O
servility O
and O
self-importance O
in O
his O
letter O
, O
which O
promises O
well O
. O
I O
am O
impatient O
to O
see O
him O
. O
" O
" O
In O
point O
of O
composition O
, O
" O
said O
Mary O
, O
" O
his O
letter O
does O
not O
seem O
defective O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
the O
olive O
branch O
perhaps O
is O
not O
wholly O
new O
, O
yet O
I O
think O
it O
is O
well O
expressed O
. O
" O
To O
Catherine O
and O
Lydia O
, O
neither O
the O
letter O
nor O
its O
writer O
were O
in O
any O
degree O
interesting O
. O
It O
was O
next O
to O
impossible O
that O
their O
cousin O
should O
come O
in O
a O
scarlet O
coat O
, O
and O
it O
was O
now O
some O
weeks O
since O
they O
had O
received O
pleasure O
from O
the O
society O
of O
a O
man O
in O
any O
other O
colour O
. O
As O
for O
their O
mother O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
letter O
had O
done O
away O
much O
of O
her O
ill-will O
, O
and O
she O
was O
preparing O
to O
see O
him O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
composure O
, O
which O
astonished O
her O
husband O
and O
daughters O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
punctual O
to O
his O
time O
, O
and O
was O
received O
with O
great O
politeness O
by O
the O
whole O
family O
. O
Mr. O
Bennet O
indeed O
said O
little O
; O
but O
the O
ladies O
were O
ready O
enough O
to O
talk O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
seemed O
neither O
in O
need O
of O
encouragement O
, O
nor O
inclined O
to O
be O
silent O
himself O
. O
He O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
heavy O
looking O
young O
man O
of O
five O
and O
twenty O
. O
His O
air O
was O
grave O
and O
stately O
, O
and O
his O
manners O
were O
very O
formal O
. O
He O
had O
not O
been O
long O
seated O
before O
he O
complimented O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
on O
having O
so O
fine O
a O
family O
of O
daughters O
, O
said O
he O
had O
heard O
much O
of O
their O
beauty O
, O
but O
that O
, O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
fame O
had O
fallen O
short O
of O
the O
truth O
; O
and O
added O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
doubt O
her O
seeing O
them O
all O
in O
due O
time O
well O
disposed O
of O
in O
marriage O
. O
This O
gallantry O
was O
not O
much O
to O
the O
taste O
of O
some O
of O
his O
hearers O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
who O
quarrelled O
with O
no O
compliments O
, O
answered O
most O
readily O
, O
" O
You O
are O
very O
kind O
, O
sir O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
; O
and O
I O
wish O
with O
all O
my O
heart O
it O
may O
prove O
so O
; O
for O
else O
they O
will O
be O
destitute O
enough O
. O
Things O
are O
settled O
so O
oddly O
. O
" O
" O
You O
allude O
perhaps O
to O
the O
entail O
of O
this O
estate O
. O
" O
" O
Ah O
! O
sir O
, O
I O
do O
indeed O
. O
It O
is O
a O
grievous O
affair O
to O
my O
poor O
girls O
, O
you O
must O
confess O
. O
Not O
that O
I O
mean O
to O
find O
fault O
with O
_you_ O
, O
for O
such O
things O
I O
know O
are O
all O
chance O
in O
this O
world O
. O
There O
is O
no O
knowing O
how O
estates O
will O
go O
when O
once O
they O
come O
to O
be O
entailed O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
very O
sensible O
, O
madam O
, O
of O
the O
hardship O
to O
my O
fair O
cousins O
, O
-- O
and O
could O
say O
much O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
but O
that O
I O
am O
cautious O
of O
appearing O
forward O
and O
precipitate O
. O
But O
I O
can O
assure O
the O
young O
ladies O
that O
I O
come O
prepared O
to O
admire O
them O
. O
At O
present O
I O
will O
not O
say O
more O
, O
but O
perhaps O
when O
we O
are O
better O
acquainted O
-- O
-- O
" O
He O
was O
interrupted O
by O
a O
summons O
to O
dinner O
; O
and O
the O
girls O
smiled O
on O
each O
other O
. O
They O
were O
not O
the O
only O
objects O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
admiration O
. O
The O
hall O
, O
the O
dining-room O
, O
and O
all O
its O
furniture O
were O
examined O
and O
praised O
; O
and O
his O
commendation O
of O
every O
thing O
would O
have O
touched O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
heart O
, O
but O
for O
the O
mortifying O
supposition O
of O
his O
viewing O
it O
all O
as O
his O
own O
future O
property O
. O
The O
dinner O
too O
in O
its O
turn O
was O
highly O
admired O
; O
and O
he O
begged O
to O
know O
to O
which O
of O
his O
fair O
cousins O
, O
the O
excellence O
of O
its O
cookery O
was O
owing O
. O
But O
here O
he O
was O
set O
right O
by O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
who O
assured O
him O
with O
some O
asperity O
that O
they O
were O
very O
well O
able O
to O
keep O
a O
good O
cook O
, O
and O
that O
her O
daughters O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
in O
the O
kitchen O
. O
He O
begged O
pardon O
for O
having O
displeased O
her O
. O
In O
a O
softened O
tone O
she O
declared O
herself O
not O
at O
all O
offended O
; O
but O
he O
continued O
to O
apologise O
for O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
. O
