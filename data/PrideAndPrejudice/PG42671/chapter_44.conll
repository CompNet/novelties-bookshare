Elizabeth O
had O
settled O
it O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
would O
bring O
his O
sister O
to O
visit O
her O
, O
the O
very O
day O
after O
her O
reaching O
Pemberley O
; O
and O
was O
consequently O
resolved O
not O
to O
be O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
the O
inn O
the O
whole O
of O
that O
morning O
. O
But O
her O
conclusion O
was O
false O
; O
for O
on O
the O
very O
morning O
after O
their O
own O
arrival O
at O
Lambton O
, O
these O
visitors O
came O
. O
They O
had O
been O
walking O
about O
the O
place O
with O
some O
of O
their O
new O
friends O
, O
and O
were O
just O
returned O
to O
the O
inn O
to O
dress O
themselves O
for O
dining O
with O
the O
same O
family O
, O
when O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
carriage O
drew O
them O
to O
a O
window O
, O
and O
they O
saw O
a O
gentleman O
and O
lady O
in O
a O
curricle O
, O
driving O
up O
the O
street O
. O
Elizabeth O
immediately O
recognising O
the O
livery O
, O
guessed O
what O
it O
meant O
, O
and O
imparted O
no O
small O
degree O
of O
surprise O
to O
her O
relations O
, O
by O
acquainting O
them O
with O
the O
honour O
which O
she O
expected O
. O
Her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
were O
all O
amazement O
; O
and O
the O
embarrassment O
of O
her O
manner O
as O
she O
spoke O
, O
joined O
to O
the O
circumstance O
itself O
, O
and O
many O
of O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
preceding O
day O
, O
opened O
to O
them O
a O
new O
idea O
on O
the O
business O
. O
Nothing O
had O
ever O
suggested O
it O
before O
, O
but O
they O
now O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
no O
other O
way O
of O
accounting O
for O
such O
attentions O
from O
such O
a O
quarter O
, O
than O
by O
supposing O
a O
partiality O
for O
their O
niece O
. O
While O
these O
newly-born O
notions O
were O
passing O
in O
their O
heads O
, O
the O
perturbation O
of O
Elizabeth O
's O
feelings O
was O
every O
moment O
increasing O
. O
She O
was O
quite O
amazed O
at O
her O
own O
discomposure O
; O
but O
amongst O
other O
causes O
of O
disquiet O
, O
she O
dreaded O
lest O
the O
partiality O
of O
the O
brother O
should O
have O
said O
too O
much O
in O
her O
favour O
; O
and O
more O
than O
commonly O
anxious O
to O
please O
, O
she O
naturally O
suspected O
that O
every O
power O
of O
pleasing O
would O
fail O
her O
. O
She O
retreated O
from O
the O
window O
, O
fearful O
of O
being O
seen O
; O
and O
as O
she O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
, O
endeavouring O
to O
compose O
herself O
, O
saw O
such O
looks O
of O
enquiring O
surprise O
in O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
as O
made O
every O
thing O
worse O
. O
Miss O
Darcy O
and O
her O
brother O
appeared O
, O
and O
this O
formidable O
introduction O
took O
place O
. O
With O
astonishment O
did O
Elizabeth O
see O
, O
that O
her O
new O
acquaintance O
was O
at O
least O
as O
much O
embarrassed O
as O
herself O
. O
Since O
her O
being O
at O
Lambton O
, O
she O
had O
heard O
that O
Miss O
Darcy O
was O
exceedingly O
proud O
; O
but O
the O
observation O
of O
a O
very O
few O
minutes O
convinced O
her O
, O
that O
she O
was O
only O
exceedingly O
shy O
. O
She O
found O
it O
difficult O
to O
obtain O
even O
a O
word O
from O
her O
beyond O
a O
monosyllable O
. O
Miss O
Darcy O
was O
tall O
, O
and O
on O
a O
larger O
scale O
than O
Elizabeth O
; O
and O
, O
though O
little O
more O
than O
sixteen O
, O
her O
figure O
was O
formed O
, O
and O
her O
appearance O
womanly O
and O
graceful O
. O
She O
was O
less O
handsome O
than O
her O
brother O
, O
but O
there O
was O
sense O
and O
good O
humour O
in O
her O
face O
, O
and O
her O
manners O
were O
perfectly O
unassuming O
and O
gentle O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
had O
expected O
to O
find O
in O
her O
as O
acute O
and O
unembarrassed O
an O
observer O
as O
ever O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
been O
, O
was O
much O
relieved O
by O
discerning O
such O
different O
feelings O
. O
They O
had O
not O
been O
long O
together O
, O
before O
Darcy O
told O
her O
that O
Bingley O
was O
also O
coming O
to O
wait O
on O
her O
; O
and O
she O
had O
barely O
time O
to O
express O
her O
satisfaction O
, O
and O
prepare O
for O
such O
a O
visitor O
, O
when O
Bingley O
's O
quick O
step O
was O
heard O
on O
the O
stairs O
, O
and O
in O
a O
moment O
he O
entered O
the O
room O
. O
All O
Elizabeth O
's O
anger O
against O
him O
had O
been O
long O
done O
away O
; O
but O
, O
had O
she O
still O
felt O
any O
, O
it O
could O
hardly O
have O
stood O
its O
ground O
against O
the O
unaffected O
cordiality O
with O
which O
he O
expressed O
himself O
, O
on O
seeing O
her O
again O
. O
He O
enquired O
in O
a O
friendly O
, O
though O
general O
way O
, O
after O
her O
family O
, O
and O
looked O
and O
spoke O
with O
the O
same O
good-humoured O
ease O
that O
he O
had O
ever O
done O
. O
To O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
he O
was O
scarcely O
a O
less O
interesting O
personage O
than O
to O
herself O
. O
They O
had O
long O
wished O
to O
see O
him O
. O
The O
whole O
party O
before O
them O
, O
indeed O
, O
excited O
a O
lively O
attention O
. O
The O
suspicions O
which O
had O
just O
arisen O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
and O
their O
niece O
, O
directed O
their O
observation O
towards O
each O
with O
an O
earnest O
, O
though O
guarded O
, O
enquiry O
; O
and O
they O
soon O
drew O
from O
those O
enquiries O
the O
full O
conviction O
that O
one O
of O
them O
at O
least O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
to O
love O
. O
Of O
the O
lady O
's O
sensations O
they O
remained O
a O
little O
in O
doubt O
; O
but O
that O
the O
gentleman O
was O
overflowing O
with O
admiration O
was O
evident O
enough O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
on O
her O
side O
, O
had O
much O
to O
do O
. O
She O
wanted O
to O
ascertain O
the O
feelings O
of O
each O
of O
her O
visitors O
, O
she O
wanted O
to O
compose O
her O
own O
, O
and O
to O
make O
herself O
agreeable O
to O
all O
; O
and O
in O
the O
latter O
object O
, O
where O
she O
feared O
most O
to O
fail O
, O
she O
was O
most O
sure O
of O
success O
, O
for O
those O
to O
whom O
she O
endeavoured O
to O
give O
pleasure O
were O
prepossessed O
in O
her O
favour O
. O
Bingley O
was O
ready O
, O
Georgiana O
was O
eager O
, O
and O
Darcy O
determined O
, O
to O
be O
pleased O
. O
In O
seeing O
Bingley O
, O
her O
thoughts O
naturally O
flew O
to O
her O
sister O
; O
and O
oh O
! O
how O
ardently O
did O
she O
long O
to O
know O
, O
whether O
any O
of O
his O
were O
directed O
in O
a O
like O
manner O
. O
Sometimes O
she O
could O
fancy O
, O
that O
he O
talked O
less O
than O
on O
former O
occasions O
, O
and O
once O
or O
twice O
pleased O
herself O
with O
the O
notion O
that O
as O
he O
looked O
at O
her O
, O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
trace O
a O
resemblance O
. O
But O
, O
though O
this O
might O
be O
imaginary O
, O
she O
could O
not O
be O
deceived O
as O
to O
his O
behaviour O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
who O
had O
been O
set O
up O
as O
a O
rival O
of O
Jane O
. O
No O
look O
appeared O
on O
either O
side O
that O
spoke O
particular O
regard O
. O
Nothing O
occurred O
between O
them O
that O
could O
justify O
the O
hopes O
of O
his O
sister O
. O
On O
this O
point O
she O
was O
soon O
satisfied O
; O
and O
two O
or O
three O
little O
circumstances O
occurred O
ere O
they O
parted O
, O
which O
, O
in O
her O
anxious O
interpretation O
, O
denoted O
a O
recollection O
of O
Jane O
, O
not O
untinctured O
by O
tenderness O
, O
and O
a O
wish O
of O
saying O
more O
that O
might O
lead O
to O
the O
mention O
of O
her O
, O
had O
he O
dared O
. O
He O
observed O
to O
her O
, O
at O
a O
moment O
when O
the O
others O
were O
talking O
together O
, O
and O
in O
a O
tone O
which O
had O
something O
of O
real O
regret O
, O
that O
it O
" O
was O
a O
very O
long O
time O
since O
he O
had O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
her O
; O
" O
and O
, O
before O
she O
could O
reply O
, O
he O
added O
, O
" O
It O
is O
above O
eight O
months O
. O
We O
have O
not O
met O
since O
the O
26th O
of O
November O
, O
when O
we O
were O
all O
dancing O
together O
at O
Netherfield O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
pleased O
to O
find O
his O
memory O
so O
exact O
; O
and O
he O
afterwards O
took O
occasion O
to O
ask O
her O
, O
when O
unattended O
to O
by O
any O
of O
the O
rest O
, O
whether O
_all_ O
her O
sisters O
were O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
There O
was O
not O
much O
in O
the O
question O
, O
nor O
in O
the O
preceding O
remark O
, O
but O
there O
was O
a O
look O
and O
a O
manner O
which O
gave O
them O
meaning O
. O
It O
was O
not O
often O
that O
she O
could O
turn O
her O
eyes O
on O
Mr. O
Darcy O
himself O
; O
but O
, O
whenever O
she O
did O
catch O
a O
glimpse O
, O
she O
saw O
an O
expression O
of O
general O
complaisance O
, O
and O
in O
all O
that O
he O
said O
, O
she O
heard O
an O
accent O
so O
far O
removed O
from O
hauteur O
or O
disdain O
of O
his O
companions O
, O
as O
convinced O
her O
that O
the O
improvement O
of O
manners O
which O
she O
had O
yesterday O
witnessed O
, O
however O
temporary O
its O
existence O
might O
prove O
, O
had O
at O
least O
outlived O
one O
day O
. O
When O
she O
saw O
him O
thus O
seeking O
the O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
courting O
the O
good O
opinion O
of O
people O
, O
with O
whom O
any O
intercourse O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
would O
have O
been O
a O
disgrace O
; O
when O
she O
saw O
him O
thus O
civil O
, O
not O
only O
to O
herself O
, O
but O
to O
the O
very O
relations O
whom O
he O
had O
openly O
disdained O
, O
and O
recollected O
their O
last O
lively O
scene O
in O
Hunsford O
Parsonage O
, O
the O
difference O
, O
the O
change O
was O
so O
great O
, O
and O
struck O
so O
forcibly O
on O
her O
mind O
, O
that O
she O
could O
hardly O
restrain O
her O
astonishment O
from O
being O
visible O
. O
Never O
, O
even O
in O
the O
company O
of O
his O
dear O
friends O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
or O
his O
dignified O
relations O
at O
Rosings O
, O
had O
she O
seen O
him O
so O
desirous O
to O
please O
, O
so O
free O
from O
self-consequence O
, O
or O
unbending O
reserve O
as O
now O
, O
when O
no O
importance O
could O
result O
from O
the O
success O
of O
his O
endeavours O
, O
and O
when O
even O
the O
acquaintance O
of O
those O
to O
whom O
his O
attentions O
were O
addressed O
, O
would O
draw O
down O
the O
ridicule O
and O
censure O
of O
the O
ladies O
both O
of O
Netherfield O
and O
Rosings O
. O
Their O
visitors O
staid O
with O
them O
above O
half O
an O
hour O
, O
and O
when O
they O
arose O
to O
depart O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
called O
on O
his O
sister O
to O
join O
him O
in O
expressing O
their O
wish O
of O
seeing O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
and O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
to O
dinner O
at O
Pemberley O
, O
before O
they O
left O
the O
country O
. O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
though O
with O
a O
diffidence O
which O
marked O
her O
little O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
giving O
invitations O
, O
readily O
obeyed O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
looked O
at O
her O
niece O
, O
desirous O
of O
knowing O
how O
_she_ O
, O
whom O
the O
invitation O
most O
concerned O
, O
felt O
disposed O
as O
to O
its O
acceptance O
, O
but O
Elizabeth O
had O
turned O
away O
her O
head O
. O
Presuming O
, O
however O
, O
that O
this O
studied O
avoidance O
spoke O
rather O
a O
momentary O
embarrassment O
, O
than O
any O
dislike O
of O
the O
proposal O
, O
and O
seeing O
in O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
was O
fond O
of O
society O
, O
a O
perfect O
willingness O
to O
accept O
it O
, O
she O
ventured O
to O
engage O
for O
her O
attendance O
, O
and O
the O
day O
after O
the O
next O
was O
fixed O
on O
. O
Bingley O
expressed O
great O
pleasure O
in O
the O
certainty O
of O
seeing O
Elizabeth O
again O
, O
having O
still O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
say O
to O
her O
, O
and O
many O
enquiries O
to O
make O
after O
all O
their O
Hertfordshire O
friends O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
construing O
all O
this O
into O
a O
wish O
of O
hearing O
her O
speak O
of O
her O
sister O
, O
was O
pleased O
; O
and O
on O
this O
account O
, O
as O
well O
as O
some O
others O
, O
found O
herself O
, O
when O
their O
visitors O
left O
them O
, O
capable O
of O
considering O
the O
last O
half O
hour O
with O
some O
satisfaction O
, O
though O
while O
it O
was O
passing O
, O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
it O
had O
been O
little O
. O
Eager O
to O
be O
alone O
, O
and O
fearful O
of O
enquiries O
or O
hints O
from O
her O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
, O
she O
staid O
with O
them O
only O
long O
enough O
to O
hear O
their O
favourable O
opinion O
of O
Bingley O
, O
and O
then O
hurried O
away O
to O
dress O
. O
But O
she O
had O
no O
reason O
to O
fear O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
's O
curiosity O
; O
it O
was O
not O
their O
wish O
to O
force O
her O
communication O
. O
It O
was O
evident O
that O
she O
was O
much O
better O
acquainted O
with O
Mr. O
Darcy O
than O
they O
had O
before O
any O
idea O
of O
; O
it O
was O
evident O
that O
he O
was O
very O
much O
in O
love O
with O
her O
. O
They O
saw O
much O
to O
interest O
, O
but O
nothing O
to O
justify O
enquiry O
. O
Of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
it O
was O
now O
a O
matter O
of O
anxiety O
to O
think O
well O
; O
and O
, O
as O
far O
as O
their O
acquaintance O
reached O
, O
there O
was O
no O
fault O
to O
find O
. O
They O
could O
not O
be O
untouched O
by O
his O
politeness O
, O
and O
had O
they O
drawn O
his O
character O
from O
their O
own O
feelings O
, O
and O
his O
servant O
's O
report O
, O
without O
any O
reference O
to O
any O
other O
account O
, O
the O
circle O
in O
Hertfordshire O
to O
which O
he O
was O
known O
, O
would O
not O
have O
recognised O
it O
for O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
There O
was O
now O
an O
interest O
, O
however O
, O
in O
believing O
the O
housekeeper O
; O
and O
they O
soon O
became O
sensible O
, O
that O
the O
authority O
of O
a O
servant O
who O
had O
known O
him O
since O
he O
was O
four O
years O
old O
, O
and O
whose O
own O
manners O
indicated O
respectability O
, O
was O
not O
to O
be O
hastily O
rejected O
. O
Neither O
had O
any O
thing O
occurred O
in O
the O
intelligence O
of O
their O
Lambton O
friends O
, O
that O
could O
materially O
lessen O
its O
weight O
. O
They O
had O
nothing O
to O
accuse O
him O
of O
but O
pride O
; O
pride O
he O
probably O
had O
, O
and O
if O
not O
, O
it O
would O
certainly O
be O
imputed O
by O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
a O
small O
market-town O
, O
where O
the O
family O
did O
not O
visit O
. O
It O
was O
acknowledged O
, O
however O
, O
that O
he O
was O
a O
liberal O
man O
, O
and O
did O
much O
good O
among O
the O
poor O
. O
With O
respect O
to O
Wickham O
, O
the O
travellers O
soon O
found O
that O
he O
was O
not O
held O
there O
in O
much O
estimation O
; O
for O
though O
the O
chief O
of O
his O
concerns O
, O
with O
the O
son O
of O
his O
patron O
, O
were O
imperfectly O
understood O
, O
it O
was O
yet O
a O
well O
known O
fact O
that O
, O
on O
his O
quitting O
Derbyshire O
, O
he O
had O
left O
many O
debts O
behind O
him O
, O
which O
Mr. O
Darcy O
afterwards O
discharged O
. O
As O
for O
Elizabeth O
, O
her O
thoughts O
were O
at O
Pemberley O
this O
evening O
more O
than O
the O
last O
; O
and O
the O
evening O
, O
though O
as O
it O
passed O
it O
seemed O
long O
, O
was O
not O
long O
enough O
to O
determine O
her O
feelings O
towards O
_one_ O
in O
that O
mansion O
; O
and O
she O
lay O
awake O
two O
whole O
hours O
, O
endeavouring O
to O
make O
them O
out O
. O
She O
certainly O
did O
not O
hate O
him O
. O
No O
; O
hatred O
had O
vanished O
long O
ago O
, O
and O
she O
had O
almost O
as O
long O
been O
ashamed O
of O
ever O
feeling O
a O
dislike O
against O
him O
, O
that O
could O
be O
so O
called O
. O
The O
respect O
created O
by O
the O
conviction O
of O
his O
valuable O
qualities O
, O
though O
at O
first O
unwillingly O
admitted O
, O
had O
for O
some O
time O
ceased O
to O
be O
repugnant O
to O
her O
feelings O
; O
and O
it O
was O
now O
heightened O
into O
somewhat O
of O
a O
friendlier O
nature O
, O
by O
the O
testimony O
so O
highly O
in O
his O
favour O
, O
and O
bringing O
forward O
his O
disposition O
in O
so O
amiable O
a O
light O
, O
which O
yesterday O
had O
produced O
. O
But O
above O
all O
, O
above O
respect O
and O
esteem O
, O
there O
was O
a O
motive O
within O
her O
of O
good O
will O
which O
could O
not O
be O
overlooked O
. O
It O
was O
gratitude. O
-- O
Gratitude O
, O
not O
merely O
for O
having O
once O
loved O
her O
, O
but O
for O
loving O
her O
still O
well O
enough O
, O
to O
forgive O
all O
the O
petulance O
and O
acrimony O
of O
her O
manner O
in O
rejecting O
him O
, O
and O
all O
the O
unjust O
accusations O
accompanying O
her O
rejection O
. O
He O
who O
, O
she O
had O
been O
persuaded O
, O
would O
avoid O
her O
as O
his O
greatest O
enemy O
, O
seemed O
, O
on O
this O
accidental O
meeting O
, O
most O
eager O
to O
preserve O
the O
acquaintance O
, O
and O
without O
any O
indelicate O
display O
of O
regard O
, O
or O
any O
peculiarity O
of O
manner O
, O
where O
their O
two O
selves O
only O
were O
concerned O
, O
was O
soliciting O
the O
good O
opinion O
of O
her O
friends O
, O
and O
bent O
on O
making O
her O
known O
to O
his O
sister O
. O
Such O
a O
change O
in O
a O
man O
of O
so O
much O
pride O
, O
excited O
not O
only O
astonishment O
but O
gratitude O
-- O
for O
to O
love O
, O
ardent O
love O
, O
it O
must O
be O
attributed O
; O
and O
as O
such O
its O
impression O
on O
her O
was O
of O
a O
sort O
to O
be O
encouraged O
, O
as O
by O
no O
means O
unpleasing O
, O
though O
it O
could O
not O
be O
exactly O
defined O
. O
She O
respected O
, O
she O
esteemed O
, O
she O
was O
grateful O
to O
him O
, O
she O
felt O
a O
real O
interest O
in O
his O
welfare O
; O
and O
she O
only O
wanted O
to O
know O
how O
far O
she O
wished O
that O
welfare O
to O
depend O
upon O
herself O
, O
and O
how O
far O
it O
would O
be O
for O
the O
happiness O
of O
both O
that O
she O
should O
employ O
the O
power O
, O
which O
her O
fancy O
told O
her O
she O
still O
possessed O
, O
of O
bringing O
on O
the O
renewal O
of O
his O
addresses O
. O
It O
had O
been O
settled O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
between O
the O
aunt O
and O
niece O
, O
that O
such O
a O
striking O
civility O
as O
Miss O
Darcy O
's O
, O
in O
coming O
to O
them O
on O
the O
very O
day O
of O
her O
arrival O
at O
Pemberley O
, O
for O
she O
had O
reached O
it O
only O
to O
a O
late O
breakfast O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
imitated O
, O
though O
it O
could O
not O
be O
equalled O
, O
by O
some O
exertion O
of O
politeness O
on O
their O
side O
; O
and O
, O
consequently O
, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
highly O
expedient O
to O
wait O
on O
her O
at O
Pemberley O
the O
following O
morning O
. O
They O
were O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
go. O
-- O
Elizabeth O
was O
pleased O
, O
though O
, O
when O
she O
asked O
herself O
the O
reason O
, O
she O
had O
very O
little O
to O
say O
in O
reply O
. O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
left O
them O
soon O
after O
breakfast O
. O
The O
fishing O
scheme O
had O
been O
renewed O
the O
day O
before O
, O
and O
a O
positive O
engagement O
made O
of O
his O
meeting O
some O
of O
the O
gentlemen O
at O
Pemberley O
by O
noon O
. O
