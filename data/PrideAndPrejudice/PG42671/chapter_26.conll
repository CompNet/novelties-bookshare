Mrs. O
Gardiner O
's O
caution O
to O
Elizabeth O
was O
punctually O
and O
kindly O
given O
on O
the O
first O
favourable O
opportunity O
of O
speaking O
to O
her O
alone O
; O
after O
honestly O
telling O
her O
what O
she O
thought O
, O
she O
thus O
went O
on O
: O
" O
You O
are O
too O
sensible O
a O
girl O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
to O
fall O
in O
love O
merely O
because O
you O
are O
warned O
against O
it O
; O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
am O
not O
afraid O
of O
speaking O
openly O
. O
Seriously O
, O
I O
would O
have O
you O
be O
on O
your O
guard O
. O
Do O
not O
involve O
yourself O
, O
or O
endeavour O
to O
involve O
him O
in O
an O
affection O
which O
the O
want O
of O
fortune O
would O
make O
so O
very O
imprudent O
. O
I O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
against O
_him_ O
; O
he O
is O
a O
most O
interesting O
young O
man O
; O
and O
if O
he O
had O
the O
fortune O
he O
ought O
to O
have O
, O
I O
should O
think O
you O
could O
not O
do O
better O
. O
But O
as O
it O
is O
-- O
you O
must O
not O
let O
your O
fancy O
run O
away O
with O
you O
. O
You O
have O
sense O
, O
and O
we O
all O
expect O
you O
to O
use O
it O
. O
Your O
father O
would O
depend O
on O
_your_ O
resolution O
and O
good O
conduct O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
. O
You O
must O
not O
disappoint O
your O
father O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
aunt O
, O
this O
is O
being O
serious O
indeed O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
to O
engage O
you O
to O
be O
serious O
likewise O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
you O
need O
not O
be O
under O
any O
alarm O
. O
I O
will O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
, O
and O
of O
Mr. O
Wickham O
too O
. O
He O
shall O
not O
be O
in O
love O
with O
me O
, O
if O
I O
can O
prevent O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Elizabeth O
, O
you O
are O
not O
serious O
now O
. O
" O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
. O
I O
will O
try O
again O
. O
At O
present O
I O
am O
not O
in O
love O
with O
Mr. O
Wickham O
; O
no O
, O
I O
certainly O
am O
not O
. O
But O
he O
is O
, O
beyond O
all O
comparison O
, O
the O
most O
agreeable O
man O
I O
ever O
saw O
-- O
and O
if O
he O
becomes O
really O
attached O
to O
me O
-- O
I O
believe O
it O
will O
be O
better O
that O
he O
should O
not O
. O
I O
see O
the O
imprudence O
of O
it. O
-- O
Oh O
! O
_that_ O
abominable O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
! O
-- O
My O
father O
's O
opinion O
of O
me O
does O
me O
the O
greatest O
honour O
; O
and O
I O
should O
be O
miserable O
to O
forfeit O
it O
. O
My O
father O
, O
however O
, O
is O
partial O
to O
Mr. O
Wickham O
. O
In O
short O
, O
my O
dear O
aunt O
, O
I O
should O
be O
very O
sorry O
to O
be O
the O
means O
of O
making O
any O
of O
you O
unhappy O
; O
but O
since O
we O
see O
every O
day O
that O
where O
there O
is O
affection O
, O
young O
people O
are O
seldom O
withheld O
by O
immediate O
want O
of O
fortune O
, O
from O
entering O
into O
engagements O
with O
each O
other O
, O
how O
can O
I O
promise O
to O
be O
wiser O
than O
so O
many O
of O
my O
fellow O
creatures O
if O
I O
am O
tempted O
, O
or O
how O
am O
I O
even O
to O
know O
that O
it O
would O
be O
wisdom O
to O
resist O
? O
All O
that O
I O
can O
promise O
you O
, O
therefore O
, O
is O
not O
to O
be O
in O
a O
hurry O
. O
I O
will O
not O
be O
in O
a O
hurry O
to O
believe O
myself O
his O
first O
object O
. O
When O
I O
am O
in O
company O
with O
him O
, O
I O
will O
not O
be O
wishing O
. O
In O
short O
, O
I O
will O
do O
my O
best O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
it O
will O
be O
as O
well O
, O
if O
you O
discourage O
his O
coming O
here O
so O
very O
often O
. O
At O
least O
, O
you O
should O
not O
_remind_ O
your O
Mother O
of O
inviting O
him O
. O
" O
" O
As O
I O
did O
the O
other O
day O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
with O
a O
conscious O
smile O
; O
" O
very O
true O
, O
it O
will O
be O
wise O
in O
me O
to O
refrain O
from O
_that_ O
. O
But O
do O
not O
imagine O
that O
he O
is O
always O
here O
so O
often O
. O
It O
is O
on O
your O
account O
that O
he O
has O
been O
so O
frequently O
invited O
this O
week O
. O
You O
know O
my O
mother O
's O
ideas O
as O
to O
the O
necessity O
of O
constant O
company O
for O
her O
friends O
. O
But O
really O
, O
and O
upon O
my O
honour O
, O
I O
will O
try O
to O
do O
what O
I O
think O
to O
be O
wisest O
; O
and O
now O
, O
I O
hope O
you O
are O
satisfied O
. O
" O
Her O
aunt O
assured O
her O
that O
she O
was O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
having O
thanked O
her O
for O
the O
kindness O
of O
her O
hints O
, O
they O
parted O
; O
a O
wonderful O
instance O
of O
advice O
being O
given O
on O
such O
a O
point O
, O
without O
being O
resented O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
returned O
into O
Hertfordshire O
soon O
after O
it O
had O
been O
quitted O
by O
the O
Gardiners O
and O
Jane O
; O
but O
as O
he O
took O
up O
his O
abode O
with O
the O
Lucases O
, O
his O
arrival O
was O
no O
great O
inconvenience O
to O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
. O
His O
marriage O
was O
now O
fast O
approaching O
, O
and O
she O
was O
at O
length O
so O
far O
resigned O
as O
to O
think O
it O
inevitable O
, O
and O
even O
repeatedly O
to O
say O
in O
an O
ill-natured O
tone O
that O
she O
" O
_wished_ O
they O
might O
be O
happy O
. O
" O
Thursday O
was O
to O
be O
the O
wedding O
day O
, O
and O
on O
Wednesday O
Miss O
Lucas O
paid O
her O
farewell O
visit O
; O
and O
when O
she O
rose O
to O
take O
leave O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
ashamed O
of O
her O
mother O
's O
ungracious O
and O
reluctant O
good O
wishes O
, O
and O
sincerely O
affected O
herself O
, O
accompanied O
her O
out O
of O
the O
room O
. O
As O
they O
went O
down O
stairs O
together O
, O
Charlotte O
said O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
depend O
on O
hearing O
from O
you O
very O
often O
, O
Eliza O
. O
" O
" O
_That_ O
you O
certainly O
shall O
. O
" O
" O
And O
I O
have O
another O
favour O
to O
ask O
. O
Will O
you O
come O
and O
see O
me O
? O
" O
" O
We O
shall O
often O
meet O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
in O
Hertfordshire O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
likely O
to O
leave O
Kent O
for O
some O
time O
. O
Promise O
me O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
come O
to O
Hunsford O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
refuse O
, O
though O
she O
foresaw O
little O
pleasure O
in O
the O
visit O
. O
" O
My O
father O
and O
Maria O
are O
to O
come O
to O
me O
in O
March O
, O
" O
added O
Charlotte O
, O
" O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
consent O
to O
be O
of O
the O
party O
. O
Indeed O
, O
Eliza O
, O
you O
will O
be O
as O
welcome O
to O
me O
as O
either O
of O
them O
. O
" O
The O
wedding O
took O
place O
; O
the O
bride O
and O
bridegroom O
set O
off O
for O
Kent O
from O
the O
church O
door O
, O
and O
every O
body O
had O
as O
much O
to O
say O
or O
to O
hear O
on O
the O
subject O
as O
usual O
. O
Elizabeth O
soon O
heard O
from O
her O
friend O
; O
and O
their O
correspondence O
was O
as O
regular O
and O
frequent O
as O
it O
had O
ever O
been O
; O
that O
it O
should O
be O
equally O
unreserved O
was O
impossible O
. O
Elizabeth O
could O
never O
address O
her O
without O
feeling O
that O
all O
the O
comfort O
of O
intimacy O
was O
over O
, O
and O
, O
though O
determined O
not O
to O
slacken O
as O
a O
correspondent O
, O
it O
was O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
what O
had O
been O
, O
rather O
than O
what O
was O
. O
Charlotte O
's O
first O
letters O
were O
received O
with O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
eagerness O
; O
there O
could O
not O
but O
be O
curiosity O
to O
know O
how O
she O
would O
speak O
of O
her O
new O
home O
, O
how O
she O
would O
like O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
and O
how O
happy O
she O
would O
dare O
pronounce O
herself O
to O
be O
; O
though O
, O
when O
the O
letters O
were O
read O
, O
Elizabeth O
felt O
that O
Charlotte O
expressed O
herself O
on O
every O
point O
exactly O
as O
she O
might O
have O
foreseen O
. O
She O
wrote O
cheerfully O
, O
seemed O
surrounded O
with O
comforts O
, O
and O
mentioned O
nothing O
which O
she O
could O
not O
praise O
. O
The O
house O
, O
furniture O
, O
neighbourhood O
, O
and O
roads O
, O
were O
all O
to O
her O
taste O
, O
and O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
behaviour O
was O
most O
friendly O
and O
obliging O
. O
It O
was O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
picture O
of O
Hunsford O
and O
Rosings O
rationally O
softened O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
perceived O
that O
she O
must O
wait O
for O
her O
own O
visit O
there O
, O
to O
know O
the O
rest O
. O
Jane O
had O
already O
written O
a O
few O
lines O
to O
her O
sister O
to O
announce O
their O
safe O
arrival O
in O
London O
; O
and O
when O
she O
wrote O
again O
, O
Elizabeth O
hoped O
it O
would O
be O
in O
her O
power O
to O
say O
something O
of O
the O
Bingleys O
. O
Her O
impatience O
for O
this O
second O
letter O
was O
as O
well O
rewarded O
as O
impatience O
generally O
is O
. O
Jane O
had O
been O
a O
week O
in O
town O
, O
without O
either O
seeing O
or O
hearing O
from O
Caroline O
. O
She O
accounted O
for O
it O
, O
however O
, O
by O
supposing O
that O
her O
last O
letter O
to O
her O
friend O
from O
Longbourn O
, O
had O
by O
some O
accident O
been O
lost O
. O
" O
My O
aunt O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
" O
is O
going O
to-morrow O
into O
that O
part O
of O
the O
town O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
take O
the O
opportunity O
of O
calling O
in O
Grosvenor-street O
. O
" O
She O
wrote O
again O
when O
the O
visit O
was O
paid O
, O
and O
she O
had O
seen O
Miss O
Bingley O
. O
" O
I O
did O
not O
think O
Caroline O
in O
spirits O
, O
" O
were O
her O
words O
, O
" O
but O
she O
was O
very O
glad O
to O
see O
me O
, O
and O
reproached O
me O
for O
giving O
her O
no O
notice O
of O
my O
coming O
to O
London O
. O
I O
was O
right O
, O
therefore O
; O
my O
last O
letter O
had O
never O
reached O
her O
. O
I O
enquired O
after O
their O
brother O
, O
of O
course O
. O
He O
was O
well O
, O
but O
so O
much O
engaged O
with O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
that O
they O
scarcely O
ever O
saw O
him O
. O
I O
found O
that O
Miss O
Darcy O
was O
expected O
to O
dinner O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
see O
her O
. O
My O
visit O
was O
not O
long O
, O
as O
Caroline O
and O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
were O
going O
out O
. O
I O
dare O
say O
I O
shall O
soon O
see O
them O
here O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
shook O
her O
head O
over O
this O
letter O
. O
It O
convinced O
her O
, O
that O
accident O
only O
could O
discover O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley O
her O
sister O
's O
being O
in O
town O
. O
Four O
weeks O
passed O
away O
, O
and O
Jane O
saw O
nothing O
of O
him O
. O
She O
endeavoured O
to O
persuade O
herself O
that O
she O
did O
not O
regret O
it O
; O
but O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
be O
blind O
to O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
inattention O
. O
After O
waiting O
at O
home O
every O
morning O
for O
a O
fortnight O
, O
and O
inventing O
every O
evening O
a O
fresh O
excuse O
for O
her O
, O
the O
visitor O
did O
at O
last O
appear O
; O
but O
the O
shortness O
of O
her O
stay O
, O
and O
yet O
more O
, O
the O
alteration O
of O
her O
manner O
, O
would O
allow O
Jane O
to O
deceive O
herself O
no O
longer O
. O
The O
letter O
which O
she O
wrote O
on O
this O
occasion O
to O
her O
sister O
, O
will O
prove O
what O
she O
felt O
. O
" O
My O
dearest O
Lizzy O
will O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
be O
incapable O
of O
triumphing O
in O
her O
better O
judgment O
, O
at O
my O
expence O
, O
when O
I O
confess O
myself O
to O
have O
been O
entirely O
deceived O
in O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
regard O
for O
me O
. O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
, O
though O
the O
event O
has O
proved O
you O
right O
, O
do O
not O
think O
me O
obstinate O
if O
I O
still O
assert O
, O
that O
, O
considering O
what O
her O
behaviour O
was O
, O
my O
confidence O
was O
as O
natural O
as O
your O
suspicion O
. O
I O
do O
not O
at O
all O
comprehend O
her O
reason O
for O
wishing O
to O
be O
intimate O
with O
me O
, O
but O
if O
the O
same O
circumstances O
were O
to O
happen O
again O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
should O
be O
deceived O
again O
. O
Caroline O
did O
not O
return O
my O
visit O
till O
yesterday O
; O
and O
not O
a O
note O
, O
not O
a O
line O
, O
did O
I O
receive O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
. O
When O
she O
did O
come O
, O
it O
was O
very O
evident O
that O
she O
had O
no O
pleasure O
in O
it O
; O
she O
made O
a O
slight O
, O
formal O
, O
apology O
, O
for O
not O
calling O
before O
, O
said O
not O
a O
word O
of O
wishing O
to O
see O
me O
again O
, O
and O
was O
in O
every O
respect O
so O
altered O
a O
creature O
, O
that O
when O
she O
went O
away O
, O
I O
was O
perfectly O
resolved O
to O
continue O
the O
acquaintance O
no O
longer O
. O
I O
pity O
, O
though O
I O
can O
not O
help O
blaming O
her O
. O
She O
was O
very O
wrong O
in O
singling O
me O
out O
as O
she O
did O
; O
I O
can O
safely O
say O
, O
that O
every O
advance O
to O
intimacy O
began O
on O
her O
side O
. O
But O
I O
pity O
her O
, O
because O
she O
must O
feel O
that O
she O
has O
been O
acting O
wrong O
, O
and O
because O
I O
am O
very O
sure O
that O
anxiety O
for O
her O
brother O
is O
the O
cause O
of O
it O
. O
I O
need O
not O
explain O
myself O
farther O
; O
and O
though O
_we_ O
know O
this O
anxiety O
to O
be O
quite O
needless O
, O
yet O
if O
she O
feels O
it O
, O
it O
will O
easily O
account O
for O
her O
behaviour O
to O
me O
; O
and O
so O
deservedly O
dear O
as O
he O
is O
to O
his O
sister O
, O
whatever O
anxiety O
she O
may O
feel O
on O
his O
behalf O
, O
is O
natural O
and O
amiable O
. O
I O
can O
not O
but O
wonder O
, O
however O
, O
at O
her O
having O
any O
such O
fears O
now O
, O
because O
, O
if O
he O
had O
at O
all O
cared O
about O
me O
, O
we O
must O
have O
met O
long O
, O
long O
ago O
. O
He O
knows O
of O
my O
being O
in O
town O
, O
I O
am O
certain O
, O
from O
something O
she O
said O
herself O
; O
and O
yet O
it O
should O
seem O
by O
her O
manner O
of O
talking O
, O
as O
if O
she O
wanted O
to O
persuade O
herself O
that O
he O
is O
really O
partial O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
. O
I O
can O
not O
understand O
it O
. O
If O
I O
were O
not O
afraid O
of O
judging O
harshly O
, O
I O
should O
be O
almost O
tempted O
to O
say O
, O
that O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
appearance O
of O
duplicity O
in O
all O
this O
. O
But O
I O
will O
endeavour O
to O
banish O
every O
painful O
thought O
, O
and O
think O
only O
of O
what O
will O
make O
me O
happy O
, O
your O
affection O
, O
and O
the O
invariable O
kindness O
of O
my O
dear O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
. O
Let O
me O
hear O
from O
you O
very O
soon O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
said O
something O
of O
his O
never O
returning O
to O
Netherfield O
again O
, O
of O
giving O
up O
the O
house O
, O
but O
not O
with O
any O
certainty O
. O
We O
had O
better O
not O
mention O
it O
. O
I O
am O
extremely O
glad O
that O
you O
have O
such O
pleasant O
accounts O
from O
our O
friends O
at O
Hunsford O
. O
Pray O
go O
to O
see O
them O
, O
with O
Sir O
William O
and O
Maria O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
you O
will O
be O
very O
comfortable O
there O

This O
letter O
gave O
Elizabeth O
some O
pain O
; O
but O
her O
spirits O
returned O
as O
she O
considered O
that O
Jane O
would O
no O
longer O
be O
duped O
, O
by O
the O
sister O
at O
least O
. O
All O
expectation O
from O
the O
brother O
was O
now O
absolutely O
over O
. O
She O
would O
not O
even O
wish O
for O
any O
renewal O
of O
his O
attentions O
. O
His O
character O
sunk O
on O
every O
review O
of O
it O
; O
and O
as O
a O
punishment O
for O
him O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
possible O
advantage O
to O
Jane O
, O
she O
seriously O
hoped O
he O
might O
really O
soon O
marry O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
's O
sister O
, O
as O
, O
by O
Wickham O
's O
account O
, O
she O
would O
make O
him O
abundantly O
regret O
what O
he O
had O
thrown O
away O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
about O
this O
time O
reminded O
Elizabeth O
of O
her O
promise O
concerning O
that O
gentleman O
, O
and O
required O
information O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
had O
such O
to O
send O
as O
might O
rather O
give O
contentment O
to O
her O
aunt O
than O
to O
herself O
. O
His O
apparent O
partiality O
had O
subsided O
, O
his O
attentions O
were O
over O
, O
he O
was O
the O
admirer O
of O
some O
one O
else O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
watchful O
enough O
to O
see O
it O
all O
, O
but O
she O
could O
see O
it O
and O
write O
of O
it O
without O
material O
pain O
. O
Her O
heart O
had O
been O
but O
slightly O
touched O
, O
and O
her O
vanity O
was O
satisfied O
with O
believing O
that O
_she_ O
would O
have O
been O
his O
only O
choice O
, O
had O
fortune O
permitted O
it O
. O
The O
sudden O
acquisition O
of O
ten O
thousand O
pounds O
was O
the O
most O
remarkable O
charm O
of O
the O
young O
lady O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
was O
now O
rendering O
himself O
agreeable O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
, O
less O
clear-sighted O
perhaps O
in O
his O
case O
than O
in O
Charlotte O
's O
, O
did O
not O
quarrel O
with O
him O
for O
his O
wish O
of O
independence O
. O
Nothing O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
could O
be O
more O
natural O
; O
and O
while O
able O
to O
suppose O
that O
it O
cost O
him O
a O
few O
struggles O
to O
relinquish O
her O
, O
she O
was O
ready O
to O
allow O
it O
a O
wise O
and O
desirable O
measure O
for O
both O
, O
and O
could O
very O
sincerely O
wish O
him O
happy O
. O
All O
this O
was O
acknowledged O
to O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
; O
and O
after O
relating O
the O
circumstances O
, O
she O
thus O
went O
on O
: O
-- O
" O
I O
am O
now O
convinced O
, O
my O
dear O
aunt O
, O
that O
I O
have O
never O
been O
much O
in O
love O
; O
for O
had O
I O
really O
experienced O
that O
pure O
and O
elevating O
passion O
, O
I O
should O
at O
present O
detest O
his O
very O
name O
, O
and O
wish O
him O
all O
manner O
of O
evil O
. O
But O
my O
feelings O
are O
not O
only O
cordial O
towards O
_him_ O
; O
they O
are O
even O
impartial O
towards O
Miss O
King O
. O
I O
can O
not O
find O
out O
that O
I O
hate O
her O
at O
all O
, O
or O
that O
I O
am O
in O
the O
least O
unwilling O
to O
think O
her O
a O
very O
good O
sort O
of O
girl O
. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
love O
in O
all O
this O
. O
My O
watchfulness O
has O
been O
effectual O
; O
and O
though O
I O
should O
certainly O
be O
a O
more O
interesting O
object O
to O
all O
my O
acquaintance O
, O
were O
I O
distractedly O
in O
love O
with O
him O
, O
I O
can O
not O
say O
that O
I O
regret O
my O
comparative O
insignificance O
. O
Importance O
may O
sometimes O
be O
purchased O
too O
dearly O
. O
Kitty O
and O
Lydia O
take O
his O
defection O
much O
more O
to O
heart O
than O
I O
do O
. O
They O
are O
young O
in O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
not O
yet O
open O
to O
the O
mortifying O
conviction O
that O
handsome O
young O
men O
must O
have O
something O
to O
live O
on O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
plain O
