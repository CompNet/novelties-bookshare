Two O
days O
after O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
return O
, O
as O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
were O
walking O
together O
in O
the O
shrubbery O
behind O
the O
house O
, O
they O
saw O
the O
housekeeper O
coming O
towards O
them O
, O
and O
, O
concluding O
that O
she O
came O
to O
call O
them O
to O
their O
mother O
, O
went O
forward O
to O
meet O
her O
; O
but O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
expected O
summons O
, O
when O
they O
approached O
her O
, O
she O
said O
to O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
, O
madam O
, O
for O
interrupting O
you O
, O
but O
I O
was O
in O
hopes O
you O
might O
have O
got O
some O
good O
news O
from O
town O
, O
so O
I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
coming O
to O
ask O
. O
" O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
Hill O
? O
We O
have O
heard O
nothing O
from O
town O
. O
" O
" O
Dear O
madam O
, O
" O
cried O
Mrs. O
Hill O
, O
in O
great O
astonishment O
, O
" O
do O
n't O
you O
know O
there O
is O
an O
express O
come O
for O
master O
from O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
? O
He O
has O
been O
here O
this O
half O
hour O
, O
and O
master O
has O
had O
a O
letter O
. O
" O
Away O
ran O
the O
girls O
, O
too O
eager O
to O
get O
in O
to O
have O
time O
for O
speech O
. O
They O
ran O
through O
the O
vestibule O
into O
the O
breakfast O
room O
; O
from O
thence O
to O
the O
library O
; O
-- O
their O
father O
was O
in O
neither O
; O
and O
they O
were O
on O
the O
point O
of O
seeking O
him O
up O
stairs O
with O
their O
mother O
, O
when O
they O
were O
met O
by O
the O
butler O
, O
who O
said O
, O
" O
If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
my O
master O
, O
ma'am O
, O
he O
is O
walking O
towards O
the O
little O
copse O
. O
" O
Upon O
this O
information O
, O
they O
instantly O
passed O
through O
the O
hall O
once O
more O
, O
and O
ran O
across O
the O
lawn O
after O
their O
father O
, O
who O
was O
deliberately O
pursuing O
his O
way O
towards O
a O
small O
wood O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
paddock O
. O
Jane O
, O
who O
was O
not O
so O
light O
, O
nor O
so O
much O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
running O
as O
Elizabeth O
, O
soon O
lagged O
behind O
, O
while O
her O
sister O
, O
panting O
for O
breath O
, O
came O
up O
with O
him O
, O
and O
eagerly O
cried O
out O
, O
" O
Oh O
, O
Papa O
, O
what O
news O
? O
what O
news O
? O
have O
you O
heard O
from O
my O
uncle O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
have O
had O
a O
letter O
from O
him O
by O
express O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
and O
what O
news O
does O
it O
bring O
? O
good O
or O
bad O
? O
" O
" O
What O
is O
there O
of O
good O
to O
be O
expected O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
taking O
the O
letter O
from O
his O
pocket O
; O
" O
but O
perhaps O
you O
would O
like O
to O
read O
it O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
impatiently O
caught O
it O
from O
his O
hand O
. O
Jane O
now O
came O
up O
. O
" O
Read O
it O
aloud O
, O
" O
said O
their O
father O
, O
" O
for O
I O
hardly O
know O
myself O
what O
it O
is O
about O
. O
" O

Gracechurch-street O

" O
MY O
DEAR O
BROTHER O
, O
" O
At O
last O
I O
am O
able O
to O
send O
you O
some O
tidings O
of O
my O
niece O
, O
and O
such O
as O
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
I O
hope O
will O
give O
you O
satisfaction O
. O
Soon O
after O
you O
left O
me O
on O
Saturday O
, O
I O
was O
fortunate O
enough O
to O
find O
out O
in O
what O
part O
of O
London O
they O
were O
. O
The O
particulars O
, O
I O
reserve O
till O
we O
meet O
. O
It O
is O
enough O
to O
know O
they O
are O
discovered O
, O
I O
have O
seen O
them O
both O
-- O
-- O
" O
" O
Then O
it O
is O
, O
as O
I O
always O
hoped O
, O
" O
cried O
Jane O
; O
" O
they O
are O
married O
! O
" O
Elizabeth O
read O
on O
; O
" O
I O
have O
seen O
them O
both O
. O
They O
are O
not O
married O
, O
nor O
can O
I O
find O
there O
was O
any O
intention O
of O
being O
so O
; O
but O
if O
you O
are O
willing O
to O
perform O
the O
engagements O
which O
I O
have O
ventured O
to O
make O
on O
your O
side O
, O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
not O
be O
long O
before O
they O
are O
. O
All O
that O
is O
required O
of O
you O
is O
, O
to O
assure O
to O
your O
daughter O
, O
by O
settlement O
, O
her O
equal O
share O
of O
the O
five O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
secured O
among O
your O
children O
after O
the O
decease O
of O
yourself O
and O
my O
sister O
; O
and O
, O
moreover O
, O
to O
enter O
into O
an O
engagement O
of O
allowing O
her O
, O
during O
your O
life O
, O
one O
hundred O
pounds O
per O
annum O
. O
These O
are O
conditions O
, O
which O
, O
considering O
every O
thing O
, O
I O
had O
no O
hesitation O
in O
complying O
with O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
thought O
myself O
privileged O
, O
for O
you O
. O
I O
shall O
send O
this O
by O
express O
, O
that O
no O
time O
may O
be O
lost O
in O
bringing O
me O
your O
answer O
. O
You O
will O
easily O
comprehend O
, O
from O
these O
particulars O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
circumstances O
are O
not O
so O
hopeless O
as O
they O
are O
generally O
believed O
to O
be O
. O
The O
world O
has O
been O
deceived O
in O
that O
respect O
; O
and O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
say O
, O
there O
will O
be O
some O
little O
money O
, O
even O
when O
all O
his O
debts O
are O
discharged O
, O
to O
settle O
on O
my O
niece O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
own O
fortune O
. O
If O
, O
as O
I O
conclude O
will O
be O
the O
case O
, O
you O
send O
me O
full O
powers O
to O
act O
in O
your O
name O
, O
throughout O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
business O
, O
I O
will O
immediately O
give O
directions O
to O
Haggerston O
for O
preparing O
a O
proper O
settlement O
. O
There O
will O
not O
be O
the O
smallest O
occasion O
for O
your O
coming O
to O
town O
again O
; O
therefore O
, O
stay O
quietly O
at O
Longbourn O
, O
and O
depend O
on O
my O
diligence O
and O
care O
. O
Send O
back O
your O
answer O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
, O
and O
be O
careful O
to O
write O
explicitly O
. O
We O
have O
judged O
it O
best O
, O
that O
my O
niece O
should O
be O
married O
from O
this O
house O
, O
of O
which O
I O
hope O
you O
will O
approve O
. O
She O
comes O
to O
us O
to-day O
. O
I O
shall O
write O
again O
as O
soon O
as O
any O
thing O
more O
is O
determined O
on O
. O
Your O
's O

& O
c O

" O
EDW O

GARDINER O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
it O
possible O
! O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
when O
she O
had O
finished O
. O
" O
Can O
it O
be O
possible O
that O
he O
will O
marry O
her O
? O
" O
" O
Wickham O
is O
not O
so O
undeserving O
, O
then O
, O
as O
we O
have O
thought O
him O
; O
" O
said O
her O
sister O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
father O
, O
I O
congratulate O
you O
. O
" O
" O
And O
have O
you O
answered O
the O
letter O
? O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
No O
; O
but O
it O
must O
be O
done O
soon O
. O
" O
Most O
earnestly O
did O
she O
then O
intreat O
him O
to O
lose O
no O
more O
time O
before O
he O
wrote O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
father O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
, O
" O
come O
back O
, O
and O
write O
immediately O
. O
Consider O
how O
important O
every O
moment O
is O
, O
in O
such O
a O
case O
. O
" O
" O
Let O
me O
write O
for O
you O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
, O
" O
if O
you O
dislike O
the O
trouble O
yourself O
. O
" O
" O
I O
dislike O
it O
very O
much O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
; O
" O
but O
it O
must O
be O
done O
. O
" O
And O
so O
saying O
, O
he O
turned O
back O
with O
them O
, O
and O
walked O
towards O
the O
house O
. O
" O
And O
may O
I O
ask O
? O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
but O
the O
terms O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
must O
be O
complied O
with O
. O
" O
" O
Complied O
with O
! O
I O
am O
only O
ashamed O
of O
his O
asking O
so O
little O
. O
" O
" O
And O
they O
_must_ O
marry O
! O
Yet O
he O
is O
_such_ O
a O
man O
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
they O
must O
marry O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
else O
to O
be O
done O
. O
But O
there O
are O
two O
things O
that O
I O
want O
very O
much O
to O
know O
: O
-- O
one O
is O
, O
how O
much O
money O
your O
uncle O
has O
laid O
down O
, O
to O
bring O
it O
about O
; O
and O
the O
other O
, O
how O
I O
am O
ever O
to O
pay O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Money O
! O
my O
uncle O
! O
" O
cried O
Jane O
, O
" O
what O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
Sir O
? O
" O
" O
I O
mean O
, O
that O
no O
man O
in O
his O
senses O
, O
would O
marry O
Lydia O
on O
so O
slight O
a O
temptation O
as O
one O
hundred O
a-year O
during O
my O
life O
, O
and O
fifty O
after O
I O
am O
gone O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
very O
true O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
though O
it O
had O
not O
occurred O
to O
me O
before O
. O
His O
debts O
to O
be O
discharged O
, O
and O
something O
still O
to O
remain O
! O
Oh O
! O
it O
must O
be O
my O
uncle O
's O
doings O
! O
Generous O
, O
good O
man O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
he O
has O
distressed O
himself O
. O
A O
small O
sum O
could O
not O
do O
all O
this O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
said O
her O
father O
, O
" O
Wickham O
's O
a O
fool O
, O
if O
he O
takes O
her O
with O
a O
farthing O
less O
than O
ten O
thousand O
pounds O
. O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
to O
think O
so O
ill O
of O
him O
, O
in O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
our O
relationship O
. O
" O
" O
Ten O
thousand O
pounds O
! O
Heaven O
forbid O
! O
How O
is O
half O
such O
a O
sum O
to O
be O
repaid O
? O
" O
Mr. O
Bennet O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
each O
of O
them O
, O
deep O
in O
thought O
, O
continued O
silent O
till O
they O
reached O
the O
house O
. O
Their O
father O
then O
went O
to O
the O
library O
to O
write O
, O
and O
the O
girls O
walked O
into O
the O
breakfast-room O
. O
" O
And O
they O
are O
really O
to O
be O
married O
! O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
by O
themselves O
. O
" O
How O
strange O
this O
is O
! O
And O
for O
_this_ O
we O
are O
to O
be O
thankful O
. O
That O
they O
should O
marry O
, O
small O
as O
is O
their O
chance O
of O
happiness O
, O
and O
wretched O
as O
is O
his O
character O
, O
we O
are O
forced O
to O
rejoice O
! O
Oh O
, O
Lydia O
! O
" O
" O
I O
comfort O
myself O
with O
thinking O
, O
" O
replied O
Jane O
, O
" O
that O
he O
certainly O
would O
not O
marry O
Lydia O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
a O
real O
regard O
for O
her O
. O
Though O
our O
kind O
uncle O
has O
done O
something O
towards O
clearing O
him O
, O
I O
can O
not O
believe O
that O
ten O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
or O
any O
thing O
like O
it O
, O
has O
been O
advanced O
. O
He O
has O
children O
of O
his O
own O
, O
and O
may O
have O
more O
. O
How O
could O
he O
spare O
half O
ten O
thousand O
pounds O
? O
" O
" O
If O
we O
are O
ever O
able O
to O
learn O
what O
Wickham O
's O
debts O
have O
been O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
and O
how O
much O
is O
settled O
on O
his O
side O
on O
our O
sister O
, O
we O
shall O
exactly O
know O
what O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
has O
done O
for O
them O
, O
because O
Wickham O
has O
not O
sixpence O
of O
his O
own O
. O
The O
kindness O
of O
my O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
can O
never O
be O
requited O
. O
Their O
taking O
her O
home O
, O
and O
affording O
her O
their O
personal O
protection O
and O
countenance O
, O
is O
such O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
her O
advantage O
, O
as O
years O
of O
gratitude O
can O
not O
enough O
acknowledge O
. O
By O
this O
time O
she O
is O
actually O
with O
them O
! O
If O
such O
goodness O
does O
not O
make O
her O
miserable O
now O
, O
she O
will O
never O
deserve O
to O
be O
happy O
! O
What O
a O
meeting O
for O
her O
, O
when O
she O
first O
sees O
my O
aunt O
! O
" O
" O
We O
must O
endeavour O
to O
forget O
all O
that O
has O
passed O
on O
either O
side O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
: O
" O
I O
hope O
and O
trust O
they O
will O
yet O
be O
happy O
. O
His O
consenting O
to O
marry O
her O
is O
a O
proof O
, O
I O
will O
believe O
, O
that O
he O
is O
come O
to O
a O
right O
way O
of O
thinking O
. O
Their O
mutual O
affection O
will O
steady O
them O
; O
and O
I O
flatter O
myself O
they O
will O
settle O
so O
quietly O
, O
and O
live O
in O
so O
rational O
a O
manner O
, O
as O
may O
in O
time O
make O
their O
past O
imprudence O
forgotten O
. O
" O
" O
Their O
conduct O
has O
been O
such O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
as O
neither O
you O
, O
nor O
I O
, O
nor O
any O
body O
, O
can O
ever O
forget O
. O
It O
is O
useless O
to O
talk O
of O
it O
. O
" O
It O
now O
occurred O
to O
the O
girls O
that O
their O
mother O
was O
in O
all O
likelihood O
perfectly O
ignorant O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
. O
They O
went O
to O
the O
library O
, O
therefore O
, O
and O
asked O
their O
father O
, O
whether O
he O
would O
not O
wish O
them O
to O
make O
it O
known O
to O
her O
. O
He O
was O
writing O
, O
and O
, O
without O
raising O
his O
head O
, O
coolly O
replied O
, O
" O
Just O
as O
you O
please O
. O
" O
" O
May O
we O
take O
my O
uncle O
's O
letter O
to O
read O
to O
her O
? O
" O
" O
Take O
whatever O
you O
like O
, O
and O
get O
away O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
took O
the O
letter O
from O
his O
writing O
table O
, O
and O
they O
went O
up O
stairs O
together O
. O
Mary O
and O
Kitty O
were O
both O
with O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
: O
one O
communication O
would O
, O
therefore O
, O
do O
for O
all O
. O
After O
a O
slight O
preparation O
for O
good O
news O
, O
the O
letter O
was O
read O
aloud O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
could O
hardly O
contain O
herself O

As O
soon O
as O
Jane O
had O
read O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
's O
hope O
of O
Lydia O
's O
being O
soon O
married O
, O
her O
joy O
burst O
forth O
, O
and O
every O
following O
sentence O
added O
to O
its O
exuberance O
. O
She O
was O
now O
in O
an O
irritation O
as O
violent O
from O
delight O
, O
as O
she O
had O
ever O
been O
fidgetty O
from O
alarm O
and O
vexation O
. O
To O
know O
that O
her O
daughter O
would O
be O
married O
was O
enough O
. O
She O
was O
disturbed O
by O
no O
fear O
for O
her O
felicity O
, O
nor O
humbled O
by O
any O
remembrance O
of O
her O
misconduct O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
, O
dear O
Lydia O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
: O
" O
This O
is O
delightful O
indeed O
! O
-- O
She O
will O
be O
married O
! O
-- O
I O
shall O
see O
her O
again O
! O
-- O
She O
will O
be O
married O
at O
sixteen O
! O
-- O
My O
good O
, O
kind O
brother O
! O
-- O
I O
knew O
how O
it O
would O
be O
-- O
I O
knew O
he O
would O
manage O
every O
thing O
. O
How O
I O
long O
to O
see O
her O
! O
and O
to O
see O
dear O
Wickham O
too O
! O
But O
the O
clothes O
, O
the O
wedding O
clothes O
! O
I O
will O
write O
to O
my O
sister O
Gardiner O
about O
them O
directly O
. O
Lizzy O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
run O
down O
to O
your O
father O
, O
and O
ask O
him O
how O
much O
he O
will O
give O
her O
. O
Stay O
, O
stay O
, O
I O
will O
go O
myself O
. O
Ring O
the O
bell O
, O
Kitty O
, O
for O
Hill O
. O
I O
will O
put O
on O
my O
things O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
My O
dear O
, O
dear O
Lydia O
! O
-- O
How O
merry O
we O
shall O
be O
together O
when O
we O
meet O
! O
" O
Her O
eldest O
daughter O
endeavoured O
to O
give O
some O
relief O
to O
the O
violence O
of O
these O
transports O
, O
by O
leading O
her O
thoughts O
to O
the O
obligations O
which O
Mr O
. O
Gardiner O
's O
behaviour O
laid O
them O
all O
under O
. O
" O
For O
we O
must O
attribute O
this O
happy O
conclusion O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
in O
a O
great O
measure O
, O
to O
his O
kindness O
. O
We O
are O
persuaded O
that O
he O
has O
pledged O
himself O
to O
assist O
Mr. O
Wickham O
with O
money O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
it O
is O
all O
very O
right O
; O
who O
should O
do O
it O
but O
her O
own O
uncle O
? O
If O
he O
had O
not O
had O
a O
family O
of O
his O
own O
, O
I O
and O
my O
children O
must O
have O
had O
all O
his O
money O
you O
know O
, O
and O
it O
is O
the O
first O
time O
we O
have O
ever O
had O
any O
thing O
from O
him O
, O
except O
a O
few O
presents O
. O
Well O
! O
I O
am O
so O
happy O
. O
In O
a O
short O
time O
, O
I O
shall O
have O
a O
daughter O
married O
. O
Mrs. O
Wickham O
! O
How O
well O
it O
sounds O
. O
And O
she O
was O
only O
sixteen O
last O
June O
. O
My O
dear O
Jane O
, O
I O
am O
in O
such O
a O
flutter O
, O
that O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
ca O
n't O
write O
; O
so O
I O
will O
dictate O
, O
and O
you O
write O
for O
me O
. O
We O
will O
settle O
with O
your O
father O
about O
the O
money O
afterwards O
; O
but O
the O
things O
should O
be O
ordered O
immediately O
. O
" O
She O
was O
then O
proceeding O
to O
all O
the O
particulars O
of O
calico O
, O
muslin O
, O
and O
cambric O
, O
and O
would O
shortly O
have O
dictated O
some O
very O
plentiful O
orders O
, O
had O
not O
Jane O
, O
though O
with O
some O
difficulty O
, O
persuaded O
her O
to O
wait O
, O
till O
her O
father O
was O
at O
leisure O
to O
be O
consulted O
. O
One O
day O
's O
delay O
she O
observed O
, O
would O
be O
of O
small O
importance O
; O
and O
her O
mother O
was O
too O
happy O
, O
to O
be O
quite O
so O
obstinate O
as O
usual O
. O
Other O
schemes O
too O
came O
into O
her O
head O
. O
" O
I O
will O
go O
to O
Meryton O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
am O
dressed O
, O
and O
tell O
the O
good O
, O
good O
news O
to O
my O
sister O
Philips O
. O
And O
as O
I O
come O
back O
, O
I O
can O
call O
on O
Lady O
Lucas O
and O
Mrs. O
Long O
. O
Kitty O
, O
run O
down O
and O
order O
the O
carriage O
. O
An O
airing O
would O
do O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
good O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
. O
Girls O
, O
can O
I O
do O
any O
thing O
for O
you O
in O
Meryton O
? O
Oh O
! O
here O
comes O
Hill O
. O
My O
dear O
Hill O
, O
have O
you O
heard O
the O
good O
news O
? O
Miss O
Lydia O
is O
going O
to O
be O
married O
; O
and O
you O
shall O
all O
have O
a O
bowl O
of O
punch O
, O
to O
make O
merry O
at O
her O
wedding O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Hill O
began O
instantly O
to O
express O
her O
joy O
. O
Elizabeth O
received O
her O
congratulations O
amongst O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
then O
, O
sick O
of O
this O
folly O
, O
took O
refuge O
in O
her O
own O
room O
, O
that O
she O
might O
think O
with O
freedom O
. O
Poor O
Lydia O
's O
situation O
must O
, O
at O
best O
, O
be O
bad O
enough O
; O
but O
that O
it O
was O
no O
worse O
, O
she O
had O
need O
to O
be O
thankful O
. O
She O
felt O
it O
so O
; O
and O
though O
, O
in O
looking O
forward O
, O
neither O
rational O
happiness O
nor O
worldly O
prosperity O
, O
could O
be O
justly O
expected O
for O
her O
sister O
; O
in O
looking O
back O
to O
what O
they O
had O
feared O
, O
only O
two O
hours O
ago O
, O
she O
felt O
all O
the O
advantages O
of O
what O
they O
had O
gained O
. O
