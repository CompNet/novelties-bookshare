Convinced O
as O
Elizabeth O
now O
was O
that O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
dislike O
of O
her O
had O
originated O
in O
jealousy O
, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
how O
very O
unwelcome O
her O
appearance O
at O
Pemberley O
must O
be O
to O
her O
, O
and O
was O
curious O
to O
know O
with O
how O
much O
civility O
on O
that O
lady O
's O
side O
, O
the O
acquaintance O
would O
now O
be O
renewed O
. O
On O
reaching O
the O
house O
, O
they O
were O
shewn O
through O
the O
hall O
into O
the O
saloon O
, O
whose O
northern O
aspect O
rendered O
it O
delightful O
for O
summer O
. O
Its O
windows O
opening O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
admitted O
a O
most O
refreshing O
view O
of O
the O
high O
woody O
hills O
behind O
the O
house O
, O
and O
of O
the O
beautiful O
oaks O
and O
Spanish O
chesnuts O
which O
were O
scattered O
over O
the O
intermediate O
lawn O
. O
In O
this O
room O
they O
were O
received O
by O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
who O
was O
sitting O
there O
with O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
and O
the O
lady O
with O
whom O
she O
lived O
in O
London O
. O
Georgiana O
's O
reception O
of O
them O
was O
very O
civil O
; O
but O
attended O
with O
all O
that O
embarrassment O
which O
, O
though O
proceeding O
from O
shyness O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
doing O
wrong O
, O
would O
easily O
give O
to O
those O
who O
felt O
themselves O
inferior O
, O
the O
belief O
of O
her O
being O
proud O
and O
reserved O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
and O
her O
niece O
, O
however O
, O
did O
her O
justice O
, O
and O
pitied O
her O
. O
By O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
they O
were O
noticed O
only O
by O
a O
curtsey O
; O
and O
on O
their O
being O
seated O
, O
a O
pause O
, O
awkward O
as O
such O
pauses O
must O
always O
be O
, O
succeeded O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
. O
It O
was O
first O
broken O
by O
Mrs. O
Annesley O
, O
a O
genteel O
, O
agreeable-looking O
woman O
, O
whose O
endeavour O
to O
introduce O
some O
kind O
of O
discourse O
, O
proved O
her O
to O
be O
more O
truly O
well O
bred O
than O
either O
of O
the O
others O
; O
and O
between O
her O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
, O
with O
occasional O
help O
from O
Elizabeth O
, O
the O
conversation O
was O
carried O
on O
. O
Miss O
Darcy O
looked O
as O
if O
she O
wished O
for O
courage O
enough O
to O
join O
in O
it O
; O
and O
sometimes O
did O
venture O
a O
short O
sentence O
, O
when O
there O
was O
least O
danger O
of O
its O
being O
heard O
. O
Elizabeth O
soon O
saw O
that O
she O
was O
herself O
closely O
watched O
by O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
and O
that O
she O
could O
not O
speak O
a O
word O
, O
especially O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
without O
calling O
her O
attention O
. O
This O
observation O
would O
not O
have O
prevented O
her O
from O
trying O
to O
talk O
to O
the O
latter O
, O
had O
they O
not O
been O
seated O
at O
an O
inconvenient O
distance O
; O
but O
she O
was O
not O
sorry O
to O
be O
spared O
the O
necessity O
of O
saying O
much O
. O
Her O
own O
thoughts O
were O
employing O
her O
. O
She O
expected O
every O
moment O
that O
some O
of O
the O
gentlemen O
would O
enter O
the O
room O
. O
She O
wished O
, O
she O
feared O
that O
the O
master O
of O
the O
house O
might O
be O
amongst O
them O
; O
and O
whether O
she O
wished O
or O
feared O
it O
most O
, O
she O
could O
scarcely O
determine O
. O
After O
sitting O
in O
this O
manner O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
, O
without O
hearing O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
voice O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
roused O
by O
receiving O
from O
her O
a O
cold O
enquiry O
after O
the O
health O
of O
her O
family O
. O
She O
answered O
with O
equal O
indifference O
and O
brevity O
, O
and O
the O
other O
said O
no O
more O
. O
The O
next O
variation O
which O
their O
visit O
afforded O
was O
produced O
by O
the O
entrance O
of O
servants O
with O
cold O
meat O
, O
cake O
, O
and O
a O
variety O
of O
all O
the O
finest O
fruits O
in O
season O
; O
but O
this O
did O
not O
take O
place O
till O
after O
many O
a O
significant O
look O
and O
smile O
from O
Mrs. O
Annesley O
to O
Miss O
Darcy O
had O
been O
given O
, O
to O
remind O
her O
of O
her O
post O
. O
There O
was O
now O
employment O
for O
the O
whole O
party O
; O
for O
though O
they O
could O
not O
all O
talk O
, O
they O
could O
all O
eat O
; O
and O
the O
beautiful O
pyramids O
of O
grapes O
, O
nectarines O
, O
and O
peaches O
, O
soon O
collected O
them O
round O
the O
table O
. O
While O
thus O
engaged O
, O
Elizabeth O
had O
a O
fair O
opportunity O
of O
deciding O
whether O
she O
most O
feared O
or O
wished O
for O
the O
appearance O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
by O
the O
feelings O
which O
prevailed O
on O
his O
entering O
the O
room O
; O
and O
then O
, O
though O
but O
a O
moment O
before O
she O
had O
believed O
her O
wishes O
to O
predominate O
, O
she O
began O
to O
regret O
that O
he O
came O
. O
He O
had O
been O
some O
time O
with O
Mr. O
Gardiner O
, O
who O
, O
with O
two O
or O
three O
other O
gentlemen O
from O
the O
house O
, O
was O
engaged O
by O
the O
river O
, O
and O
had O
left O
him O
only O
on O
learning O
that O
the O
ladies O
of O
the O
family O
intended O
a O
visit O
to O
Georgiana O
that O
morning O
. O
No O
sooner O
did O
he O
appear O
, O
than O
Elizabeth O
wisely O
resolved O
to O
be O
perfectly O
easy O
and O
unembarrassed O
; O
-- O
a O
resolution O
the O
more O
necessary O
to O
be O
made O
, O
but O
perhaps O
not O
the O
more O
easily O
kept O
, O
because O
she O
saw O
that O
the O
suspicions O
of O
the O
whole O
party O
were O
awakened O
against O
them O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
scarcely O
an O
eye O
which O
did O
not O
watch O
his O
behaviour O
when O
he O
first O
came O
into O
the O
room O
. O
In O
no O
countenance O
was O
attentive O
curiosity O
so O
strongly O
marked O
as O
in O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
smiles O
which O
overspread O
her O
face O
whenever O
she O
spoke O
to O
one O
of O
its O
objects O
; O
for O
jealousy O
had O
not O
yet O
made O
her O
desperate O
, O
and O
her O
attentions O
to O
Mr. O
Darcy O
were O
by O
no O
means O
over O
. O
Miss O
Darcy O
, O
on O
her O
brother O
's O
entrance O
, O
exerted O
herself O
much O
more O
to O
talk O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
saw O
that O
he O
was O
anxious O
for O
his O
sister O
and O
herself O
to O
get O
acquainted O
, O
and O
forwarded O
, O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
every O
attempt O
at O
conversation O
on O
either O
side O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
saw O
all O
this O
likewise O
; O
and O
, O
in O
the O
imprudence O
of O
anger O
, O
took O
the O
first O
opportunity O
of O
saying O
, O
with O
sneering O
civility O
, O
" O
Pray O
, O
Miss O
Eliza O
, O
are O
not O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
militia O
removed O
from O
Meryton O
? O
They O
must O
be O
a O
great O
loss O
to O
_your_ O
family O
. O
" O
In O
Darcy O
's O
presence O
she O
dared O
not O
mention O
Wickham O
's O
name O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
instantly O
comprehended O
that O
he O
was O
uppermost O
in O
her O
thoughts O
; O
and O
the O
various O
recollections O
connected O
with O
him O
gave O
her O
a O
moment O
's O
distress O
; O
but O
, O
exerting O
herself O
vigorously O
to O
repel O
the O
ill-natured O
attack O
, O
she O
presently O
answered O
the O
question O
in O
a O
tolerably O
disengaged O
tone O
. O
While O
she O
spoke O
, O
an O
involuntary O
glance O
shewed O
her O
Darcy O
with O
an O
heightened O
complexion O
, O
earnestly O
looking O
at O
her O
, O
and O
his O
sister O
overcome O
with O
confusion O
, O
and O
unable O
to O
lift O
up O
her O
eyes O
. O
Had O
Miss O
Bingley O
known O
what O
pain O
she O
was O
then O
giving O
her O
beloved O
friend O
, O
she O
undoubtedly O
would O
have O
refrained O
from O
the O
hint O
; O
but O
she O
had O
merely O
intended O
to O
discompose O
Elizabeth O
, O
by O
bringing O
forward O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
man O
to O
whom O
she O
believed O
her O
partial O
, O
to O
make O
her O
betray O
a O
sensibility O
which O
might O
injure O
her O
in O
Darcy O
's O
opinion O
, O
and O
perhaps O
to O
remind O
the O
latter O
of O
all O
the O
follies O
and O
absurdities O
, O
by O
which O
some O
part O
of O
her O
family O
were O
connected O
with O
that O
corps O
. O
Not O
a O
syllable O
had O
ever O
reached O
her O
of O
Miss O
Darcy O
's O
meditated O
elopement O
. O
To O
no O
creature O
had O
it O
been O
revealed O
, O
where O
secresy O
was O
possible O
, O
except O
to O
Elizabeth O
; O
and O
from O
all O
Bingley O
's O
connections O
her O
brother O
was O
particularly O
anxious O
to O
conceal O
it O
, O
from O
that O
very O
wish O
which O
Elizabeth O
had O
long O
ago O
attributed O
to O
him O
, O
of O
their O
becoming O
hereafter O
her O
own O
. O
He O
had O
certainly O
formed O
such O
a O
plan O
, O
and O
without O
meaning O
that O
it O
should O
affect O
his O
endeavour O
to O
separate O
him O
from O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
it O
might O
add O
something O
to O
his O
lively O
concern O
for O
the O
welfare O
of O
his O
friend O
. O
Elizabeth O
's O
collected O
behaviour O
, O
however O
, O
soon O
quieted O
his O
emotion O
; O
and O
as O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
vexed O
and O
disappointed O
, O
dared O
not O
approach O
nearer O
to O
Wickham O
, O
Georgiana O
also O
recovered O
in O
time O
, O
though O
not O
enough O
to O
be O
able O
to O
speak O
any O
more O
. O
Her O
brother O
, O
whose O
eye O
she O
feared O
to O
meet O
, O
scarcely O
recollected O
her O
interest O
in O
the O
affair O
, O
and O
the O
very O
circumstance O
which O
had O
been O
designed O
to O
turn O
his O
thoughts O
from O
Elizabeth O
, O
seemed O
to O
have O
fixed O
them O
on O
her O
more O
, O
and O
more O
cheerfully O
. O
Their O
visit O
did O
not O
continue O
long O
after O
the O
question O
and O
answer O
above-mentioned O
; O
and O
while O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
attending O
them O
to O
their O
carriage O
, O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
venting O
her O
feelings O
in O
criticisms O
on O
Elizabeth O
's O
person O
, O
behaviour O
, O
and O
dress O
. O
But O
Georgiana O
would O
not O
join O
her O
. O
Her O
brother O
's O
recommendation O
was O
enough O
to O
ensure O
her O
favour O
: O
his O
judgment O
could O
not O
err O
, O
and O
he O
had O
spoken O
in O
such O
terms O
of O
Elizabeth O
, O
as O
to O
leave O
Georgiana O
without O
the O
power O
of O
finding O
her O
otherwise O
than O
lovely O
and O
amiable O
. O
When O
Darcy O
returned O
to O
the O
saloon O
, O
Miss O
Bingley O
could O
not O
help O
repeating O
to O
him O
some O
part O
of O
what O
she O
had O
been O
saying O
to O
his O
sister O
. O
" O
How O
very O
ill O
Eliza O
Bennet O
looks O
this O
morning O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
; O
" O
I O
never O
in O
my O
life O
saw O
any O
one O
so O
much O
altered O
as O
she O
is O
since O
the O
winter O
. O
She O
is O
grown O
so O
brown O
and O
coarse O
! O
Louisa O
and O
I O
were O
agreeing O
that O
we O
should O
not O
have O
known O
her O
again O
. O
" O
However O
little O
Mr. O
Darcy O
might O
have O
liked O
such O
an O
address O
, O
he O
contented O
himself O
with O
coolly O
replying O
, O
that O
he O
perceived O
no O
other O
alteration O
than O
her O
being O
rather O
tanned O
, O
-- O
no O
miraculous O
consequence O
of O
travelling O
in O
the O
summer O
. O
" O
For O
my O
own O
part O
, O
" O
she O
rejoined O
, O
" O
I O
must O
confess O
that O
I O
never O
could O
see O
any O
beauty O
in O
her O
. O
Her O
face O
is O
too O
thin O
; O
her O
complexion O
has O
no O
brilliancy O
; O
and O
her O
features O
are O
not O
at O
all O
handsome O
. O
Her O
nose O
wants O
character O
; O
there O
is O
nothing O
marked O
in O
its O
lines O
. O
Her O
teeth O
are O
tolerable O
, O
but O
not O
out O
of O
the O
common O
way O
; O
and O
as O
for O
her O
eyes O
, O
which O
have O
sometimes O
been O
called O
so O
fine O
, O
I O
never O
could O
perceive O
any O
thing O
extraordinary O
in O
them O
. O
They O
have O
a O
sharp O
, O
shrewish O
look O
, O
which O
I O
do O
not O
like O
at O
all O
; O
and O
in O
her O
air O
altogether O
, O
there O
is O
a O
self-sufficiency O
without O
fashion O
, O
which O
is O
intolerable O
. O
" O
Persuaded O
as O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
that O
Darcy O
admired O
Elizabeth O
, O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
method O
of O
recommending O
herself O
; O
but O
angry O
people O
are O
not O
always O
wise O
; O
and O
in O
seeing O
him O
at O
last O
look O
somewhat O
nettled O
, O
she O
had O
all O
the O
success O
she O
expected O
. O
He O
was O
resolutely O
silent O
however O
; O
and O
, O
from O
a O
determination O
of O
making O
him O
speak O
, O
she O
continued O
, O
" O
I O
remember O
, O
when O
we O
first O
knew O
her O
in O
Hertfordshire O
, O
how O
amazed O
we O
all O
were O
to O
find O
that O
she O
was O
a O
reputed O
beauty O
; O
and O
I O
particularly O
recollect O
your O
saying O
one O
night O
, O
after O
they O
had O
been O
dining O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
'_She_ O
a O
beauty O
! O
-- O
I O
should O
as O
soon O
call O
her O
mother O
a O
wit O
. O
' O
But O
afterwards O
she O
seemed O
to O
improve O
on O
you O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
you O
thought O
her O
rather O
pretty O
at O
one O
time O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
Darcy O
, O
who O
could O
contain O
himself O
no O
longer O
, O
" O
but O
_that_ O
was O
only O
when O
I O
first O
knew O
her O
, O
for O
it O
is O
many O
months O
since O
I O
have O
considered O
her O
as O
one O
of O
the O
handsomest O
women O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
. O
" O
He O
then O
went O
away O
, O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
was O
left O
to O
all O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
having O
forced O
him O
to O
say O
what O
gave O
no O
one O
any O
pain O
but O
herself O
. O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
and O
Elizabeth O
talked O
of O
all O
that O
had O
occurred O
, O
during O
their O
visit O
, O
as O
they O
returned O
, O
except O
what O
had O
particularly O
interested O
them O
both O
. O
The O
looks O
and O
behaviour O
of O
every O
body O
they O
had O
seen O
were O
discussed O
, O
except O
of O
the O
person O
who O
had O
mostly O
engaged O
their O
attention O
. O
They O
talked O
of O
his O
sister O
, O
his O
friends O
, O
his O
house O
, O
his O
fruit O
, O
of O
every O
thing O
but O
himself O
; O
yet O
Elizabeth O
was O
longing O
to O
know O
what O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
thought O
of O
him O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Gardiner O
would O
have O
been O
highly O
gratified O
by O
her O
niece O
's O
beginning O
the O
subject O
. O
