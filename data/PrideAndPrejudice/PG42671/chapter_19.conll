The O
next O
day O
opened O
a O
new O
scene O
at O
Longbourn O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
made O
his O
declaration O
in O
form O
. O
Having O
resolved O
to O
do O
it O
without O
loss O
of O
time O
, O
as O
his O
leave O
of O
absence O
extended O
only O
to O
the O
following O
Saturday O
, O
and O
having O
no O
feelings O
of O
diffidence O
to O
make O
it O
distressing O
to O
himself O
even O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
he O
set O
about O
it O
in O
a O
very O
orderly O
manner O
, O
with O
all O
the O
observances O
which O
he O
supposed O
a O
regular O
part O
of O
the O
business O
. O
On O
finding O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
younger O
girls O
together O
, O
soon O
after O
breakfast O
, O
he O
addressed O
the O
mother O
in O
these O
words O
, O
" O
May O
I O
hope O
, O
Madam O
, O
for O
your O
interest O
with O
your O
fair O
daughter O
Elizabeth O
, O
when O
I O
solicit O
for O
the O
honour O
of O
a O
private O
audience O
with O
her O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
morning O
? O
" O
Before O
Elizabeth O
had O
time O
for O
any O
thing O
but O
a O
blush O
of O
surprise O
, O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
instantly O
answered O
, O
" O
Oh O
dear O
! O
-- O
Yes O
-- O
certainly. O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
Lizzy O
will O
be O
very O
happy O
-- O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
can O
have O
no O
objection. O
-- O
Come O
, O
Kitty O
, O
I O
want O
you O
up O
stairs O
. O
" O
And O
gathering O
her O
work O
together O
, O
she O
was O
hastening O
away O
, O
when O
Elizabeth O
called O
out O
, O
" O
Dear O
Ma'am O
, O
do O
not O
go. O
-- O
I O
beg O
you O
will O
not O
go. O
-- O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
must O
excuse O
me. O
-- O
He O
can O
have O
nothing O
to O
say O
to O
me O
that O
any O
body O
need O
not O
hear O
. O
I O
am O
going O
away O
myself O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
no O
, O
nonsense O
, O
Lizzy. O
-- O
I O
desire O
you O
will O
stay O
where O
you O
are O
. O
" O
-- O
And O
upon O
Elizabeth O
's O
seeming O
really O
, O
with O
vexed O
and O
embarrassed O
looks O
, O
about O
to O
escape O
, O
she O
added O
, O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
I O
_insist_ O
upon O
your O
staying O
and O
hearing O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
would O
not O
oppose O
such O
an O
injunction O
-- O
and O
a O
moment O
's O
consideration O
making O
her O
also O
sensible O
that O
it O
would O
be O
wisest O
to O
get O
it O
over O
as O
soon O
and O
as O
quietly O
as O
possible O
, O
she O
sat O
down O
again O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
conceal O
by O
incessant O
employment O
the O
feelings O
which O
were O
divided O
between O
distress O
and O
diversion O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
and O
Kitty O
walked O
off O
, O
and O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
gone O
Mr. O
Collins O
began O
. O
" O
Believe O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
, O
that O
your O
modesty O
, O
so O
far O
from O
doing O
you O
any O
disservice O
, O
rather O
adds O
to O
your O
other O
perfections O
. O
You O
would O
have O
been O
less O
amiable O
in O
my O
eyes O
had O
there O
_not_ O
been O
this O
little O
unwillingness O
; O
but O
allow O
me O
to O
assure O
you O
that O
I O
have O
your O
respected O
mother O
's O
permission O
for O
this O
address O
. O
You O
can O
hardly O
doubt O
the O
purport O
of O
my O
discourse O
, O
however O
your O
natural O
delicacy O
may O
lead O
you O
to O
dissemble O
; O
my O
attentions O
have O
been O
too O
marked O
to O
be O
mistaken O
. O
Almost O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
entered O
the O
house O
I O
singled O
you O
out O
as O
the O
companion O
of O
my O
future O
life O
. O
But O
before O
I O
am O
run O
away O
with O
by O
my O
feelings O
on O
this O
subject O
, O
perhaps O
it O
will O
be O
advisable O
for O
me O
to O
state O
my O
reasons O
for O
marrying O
-- O
and O
moreover O
for O
coming O
into O
Hertfordshire O
with O
the O
design O
of O
selecting O
a O
wife O
, O
as O
I O
certainly O
did O
. O
" O
The O
idea O
of O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
with O
all O
his O
solemn O
composure O
, O
being O
run O
away O
with O
by O
his O
feelings O
, O
made O
Elizabeth O
so O
near O
laughing O
that O
she O
could O
not O
use O
the O
short O
pause O
he O
allowed O
in O
any O
attempt O
to O
stop O
him O
farther O
, O
and O
he O
continued O
: O
" O
My O
reasons O
for O
marrying O
are O
, O
first O
, O
that O
I O
think O
it O
a O
right O
thing O
for O
every O
clergyman O
in O
easy O
circumstances O
( O
like O
myself O
) O
to O
set O
the O
example O
of O
matrimony O
in O
his O
parish O
. O
Secondly O
, O
that O
I O
am O
convinced O
it O
will O
add O
very O
greatly O
to O
my O
happiness O
; O
and O
thirdly O
-- O
which O
perhaps O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
mentioned O
earlier O
, O
that O
it O
is O
the O
particular O
advice O
and O
recommendation O
of O
the O
very O
noble O
lady O
whom O
I O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
calling O
patroness O
. O
Twice O
has O
she O
condescended O
to O
give O
me O
her O
opinion O
( O
unasked O
too O
! O
) O
on O
this O
subject O
; O
and O
it O
was O
but O
the O
very O
Saturday O
night O
before O
I O
left O
Hunsford O
-- O
between O
our O
pools O
at O
quadrille O
, O
while O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
was O
arranging O
Miss O
de O
Bourgh O
's O
foot-stool O
, O
that O
she O
said O
, O
'Mr O
. O
Collins O
, O
you O
must O
marry O
. O
A O
clergyman O
like O
you O
must O
marry. O
-- O
Chuse O
properly O
, O
chuse O
a O
gentlewoman O
for O
_my_ O
sake O
; O
and O
for O
your O
_own_ O
, O
let O
her O
be O
an O
active O
, O
useful O
sort O
of O
person O
, O
not O
brought O
up O
high O
, O
but O
able O
to O
make O
a O
small O
income O
go O
a O
good O
way O
. O
This O
is O
my O
advice O
. O
Find O
such O
a O
woman O
as O
soon O
as O
you O
can O
, O
bring O
her O
to O
Hunsford O
, O
and O
I O
will O
visit O
her O
. O
' O
Allow O
me O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
to O
observe O
, O
my O
fair O
cousin O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
reckon O
the O
notice O
and O
kindness O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
as O
among O
the O
least O
of O
the O
advantages O
in O
my O
power O
to O
offer O
. O
You O
will O
find O
her O
manners O
beyond O
any O
thing O
I O
can O
describe O
; O
and O
your O
wit O
and O
vivacity O
I O
think O
must O
be O
acceptable O
to O
her O
, O
especially O
when O
tempered O
with O
the O
silence O
and O
respect O
which O
her O
rank O
will O
inevitably O
excite O
. O
Thus O
much O
for O
my O
general O
intention O
in O
favour O
of O
matrimony O
; O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
told O
why O
my O
views O
were O
directed O
to O
Longbourn O
instead O
of O
my O
own O
neighbourhood O
, O
where O
I O
assure O
you O
there O
are O
many O
amiable O
young O
women O
. O
But O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
being O
, O
as O
I O
am O
, O
to O
inherit O
this O
estate O
after O
the O
death O
of O
your O
honoured O
father O
, O
( O
who O
, O
however O
, O
may O
live O
many O
years O
longer O
, O
) O
I O
could O
not O
satisfy O
myself O
without O
resolving O
to O
chuse O
a O
wife O
from O
among O
his O
daughters O
, O
that O
the O
loss O
to O
them O
might O
be O
as O
little O
as O
possible O
, O
when O
the O
melancholy O
event O
takes O
place O
-- O
which O
, O
however O
, O
as O
I O
have O
already O
said O
, O
may O
not O
be O
for O
several O
years O
. O
This O
has O
been O
my O
motive O
, O
my O
fair O
cousin O
, O
and O
I O
flatter O
myself O
it O
will O
not O
sink O
me O
in O
your O
esteem O
. O
And O
now O
nothing O
remains O
for O
me O
but O
to O
assure O
you O
in O
the O
most O
animated O
language O
of O
the O
violence O
of O
my O
affection O
. O
To O
fortune O
I O
am O
perfectly O
indifferent O
, O
and O
shall O
make O
no O
demand O
of O
that O
nature O
on O
your O
father O
, O
since O
I O
am O
well O
aware O
that O
it O
could O
not O
be O
complied O
with O
; O
and O
that O
one O
thousand O
pounds O
in O
the O
4 O
per O
cents O
. O
which O
will O
not O
be O
yours O
till O
after O
your O
mother O
's O
decease O
, O
is O
all O
that O
you O
may O
ever O
be O
entitled O
to O
. O
On O
that O
head O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
uniformly O
silent O
; O
and O
you O
may O
assure O
yourself O
that O
no O
ungenerous O
reproach O
shall O
ever O
pass O
my O
lips O
when O
we O
are O
married O
. O
" O
It O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
to O
interrupt O
him O
now O
. O
" O
You O
are O
too O
hasty O
, O
Sir O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
You O
forget O
that O
I O
have O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
Let O
me O
do O
it O
without O
farther O
loss O
of O
time O
. O
Accept O
my O
thanks O
for O
the O
compliment O
you O
are O
paying O
me O
. O
I O
am O
very O
sensible O
of O
the O
honour O
of O
your O
proposals O
, O
but O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
me O
to O
do O
otherwise O
than O
decline O
them O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
now O
to O
learn O
, O
" O
replied O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
with O
a O
formal O
wave O
of O
the O
hand O
, O
" O
that O
it O
is O
usual O
with O
young O
ladies O
to O
reject O
the O
addresses O
of O
the O
man O
whom O
they O
secretly O
mean O
to O
accept O
, O
when O
he O
first O
applies O
for O
their O
favour O
; O
and O
that O
sometimes O
the O
refusal O
is O
repeated O
a O
second O
or O
even O
a O
third O
time O
. O
I O
am O
therefore O
by O
no O
means O
discouraged O
by O
what O
you O
have O
just O
said O
, O
and O
shall O
hope O
to O
lead O
you O
to O
the O
altar O
ere O
long O
. O
" O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
Sir O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
your O
hope O
is O
rather O
an O
extraordinary O
one O
after O
my O
declaration O
. O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
that O
I O
am O
not O
one O
of O
those O
young O
ladies O
( O
if O
such O
young O
ladies O
there O
are O
) O
who O
are O
so O
daring O
as O
to O
risk O
their O
happiness O
on O
the O
chance O
of O
being O
asked O
a O
second O
time O
. O
I O
am O
perfectly O
serious O
in O
my O
refusal. O
-- O
You O
could O
not O
make O
_me_ O
happy O
, O
and O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
I O
am O
the O
last O
woman O
in O
the O
world O
who O
would O
make O
_you_ O
so. O
-- O
Nay O
, O
were O
your O
friend O
Lady O
Catherine O
to O
know O
me O
, O
I O
am O
persuaded O
she O
would O
find O
me O
in O
every O
respect O
ill O
qualified O
for O
the O
situation O
. O
" O
" O
Were O
it O
certain O
that O
Lady O
Catherine O
would O
think O
so O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Collins O
very O
gravely O
-- O
" O
but O
I O
can O
not O
imagine O
that O
her O
ladyship O
would O
at O
all O
disapprove O
of O
you O
. O
And O
you O
may O
be O
certain O
that O
when O
I O
have O
the O
honour O
of O
seeing O
her O
again O
I O
shall O
speak O
in O
the O
highest O
terms O
of O
your O
modesty O
, O
economy O
, O
and O
other O
amiable O
qualifications O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
all O
praise O
of O
me O
will O
be O
unnecessary O
. O
You O
must O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
judge O
for O
myself O
, O
and O
pay O
me O
the O
compliment O
of O
believing O
what O
I O
say O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
very O
happy O
and O
very O
rich O
, O
and O
by O
refusing O
your O
hand O
, O
do O
all O
in O
my O
power O
to O
prevent O
your O
being O
otherwise O
. O
In O
making O
me O
the O
offer O
, O
you O
must O
have O
satisfied O
the O
delicacy O
of O
your O
feelings O
with O
regard O
to O
my O
family O
, O
and O
may O
take O
possession O
of O
Longbourn O
estate O
whenever O
it O
falls O
, O
without O
any O
self-reproach O
. O
This O
matter O
may O
be O
considered O
, O
therefore O
, O
as O
finally O
settled O
. O
" O
And O
rising O
as O
she O
thus O
spoke O
, O
she O
would O
have O
quitted O
the O
room O
, O
had O
not O
Mr. O
Collins O
thus O
addressed O
her O
, O
" O
When O
I O
do O
myself O
the O
honour O
of O
speaking O
to O
you O
next O
on O
this O
subject O
I O
shall O
hope O
to O
receive O
a O
more O
favourable O
answer O
than O
you O
have O
now O
given O
me O
; O
though O
I O
am O
far O
from O
accusing O
you O
of O
cruelty O
at O
present O
, O
because O
I O
know O
it O
to O
be O
the O
established O
custom O
of O
your O
sex O
to O
reject O
a O
man O
on O
the O
first O
application O
, O
and O
perhaps O
you O
have O
even O
now O
said O
as O
much O
to O
encourage O
my O
suit O
as O
would O
be O
consistent O
with O
the O
true O
delicacy O
of O
the O
female O
character O
. O
" O
" O
Really O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
with O
some O
warmth O
, O
" O
you O
puzzle O
me O
exceedingly O
. O
If O
what O
I O
have O
hitherto O
said O
can O
appear O
to O
you O
in O
the O
form O
of O
encouragement O
, O
I O
know O
not O
how O
to O
express O
my O
refusal O
in O
such O
a O
way O
as O
may O
convince O
you O
of O
its O
being O
one O
. O
" O
" O
You O
must O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
flatter O
myself O
, O
my O
dear O
cousin O
, O
that O
your O
refusal O
of O
my O
addresses O
is O
merely O
words O
of O
course O
. O
My O
reasons O
for O
believing O
it O
are O
briefly O
these O
: O
-- O
It O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
me O
that O
my O
hand O
is O
unworthy O
your O
acceptance O
, O
or O
that O
the O
establishment O
I O
can O
offer O
would O
be O
any O
other O
than O
highly O
desirable O
. O
My O
situation O
in O
life O
, O
my O
connections O
with O
the O
family O
of O
De O
Bourgh O
, O
and O
my O
relationship O
to O
your O
own O
, O
are O
circumstances O
highly O
in O
my O
favour O
; O
and O
you O
should O
take O
it O
into O
farther O
consideration O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
your O
manifold O
attractions O
, O
it O
is O
by O
no O
means O
certain O
that O
another O
offer O
of O
marriage O
may O
ever O
be O
made O
you O
. O
Your O
portion O
is O
unhappily O
so O
small O
that O
it O
will O
in O
all O
likelihood O
undo O
the O
effects O
of O
your O
loveliness O
and O
amiable O
qualifications O
. O
As O
I O
must O
therefore O
conclude O
that O
you O
are O
not O
serious O
in O
your O
rejection O
of O
me O
, O
I O
shall O
chuse O
to O
attribute O
it O
to O
your O
wish O
of O
increasing O
my O
love O
by O
suspense O
, O
according O
to O
the O
usual O
practice O
of O
elegant O
females O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
assure O
you O
, O
Sir O
, O
that O
I O
have O
no O
pretension O
whatever O
to O
that O
kind O
of O
elegance O
which O
consists O
in O
tormenting O
a O
respectable O
man O
. O
I O
would O
rather O
be O
paid O
the O
compliment O
of O
being O
believed O
sincere O
. O
I O
thank O
you O
again O
and O
again O
for O
the O
honour O
you O
have O
done O
me O
in O
your O
proposals O
, O
but O
to O
accept O
them O
is O
absolutely O
impossible O
. O
My O
feelings O
in O
every O
respect O
forbid O
it O
. O
Can O
I O
speak O
plainer O
? O
Do O
not O
consider O
me O
now O
as O
an O
elegant O
female O
intending O
to O
plague O
you O
, O
but O
as O
a O
rational O
creature O
speaking O
the O
truth O
from O
her O
heart O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
uniformly O
charming O
! O
" O
cried O
he O
, O
with O
an O
air O
of O
awkward O
gallantry O
; O
" O
and O
I O
am O
persuaded O
that O
when O
sanctioned O
by O
the O
express O
authority O
of O
both O
your O
excellent O
parents O
, O
my O
proposals O
will O
not O
fail O
of O
being O
acceptable O
. O
" O
To O
such O
perseverance O
in O
wilful O
self-deception O
Elizabeth O
would O
make O
no O
reply O
, O
and O
immediately O
and O
in O
silence O
withdrew O
; O
determined O
, O
if O
he O
persisted O
in O
considering O
her O
repeated O
refusals O
as O
flattering O
encouragement O
, O
to O
apply O
to O
her O
father O
, O
whose O
negative O
might O
be O
uttered O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
must O
be O
decisive O
, O
and O
whose O
behaviour O
at O
least O
could O
not O
be O
mistaken O
for O
the O
affectation O
and O
coquetry O
of O
an O
elegant O
female O
. O
