More O
than O
once O
did O
Elizabeth O
in O
her O
ramble O
within O
the O
Park O
, O
unexpectedly O
meet O
Mr O
. O
Darcy. O
-- O
She O
felt O
all O
the O
perverseness O
of O
the O
mischance O
that O
should O
bring O
him O
where O
no O
one O
else O
was O
brought O
; O
and O
to O
prevent O
its O
ever O
happening O
again O
, O
took O
care O
to O
inform O
him O
at O
first O
, O
that O
it O
was O
a O
favourite O
haunt O
of O
hers. O
-- O
How O
it O
could O
occur O
a O
second O
time O
therefore O
was O
very O
odd O
! O
-- O
Yet O
it O
did O
, O
and O
even O
a O
third O
. O
It O
seemed O
like O
wilful O
ill-nature O
, O
or O
a O
voluntary O
penance O
, O
for O
on O
these O
occasions O
it O
was O
not O
merely O
a O
few O
formal O
enquiries O
and O
an O
awkward O
pause O
and O
then O
away O
, O
but O
he O
actually O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
turn O
back O
and O
walk O
with O
her O
. O
He O
never O
said O
a O
great O
deal O
, O
nor O
did O
she O
give O
herself O
the O
trouble O
of O
talking O
or O
of O
listening O
much O
; O
but O
it O
struck O
her O
in O
the O
course O
of O
their O
third O
rencontre O
that O
he O
was O
asking O
some O
odd O
unconnected O
questions O
-- O
about O
her O
pleasure O
in O
being O
at O
Hunsford O
, O
her O
love O
of O
solitary O
walks O
, O
and O
her O
opinion O
of O
Mr O
. O
and O
Mrs. O
Collins O
's O
happiness O
; O
and O
that O
in O
speaking O
of O
Rosings O
and O
her O
not O
perfectly O
understanding O
the O
house O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
expect O
that O
whenever O
she O
came O
into O
Kent O
again O
she O
would O
be O
staying O
_there_ O
too O
. O
His O
words O
seemed O
to O
imply O
it O
. O
Could O
he O
have O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
in O
his O
thoughts O
? O
She O
supposed O
, O
if O
he O
meant O
any O
thing O
, O
he O
must O
mean O
an O
allusion O
to O
what O
might O
arise O
in O
that O
quarter O
. O
It O
distressed O
her O
a O
little O
, O
and O
she O
was O
quite O
glad O
to O
find O
herself O
at O
the O
gate O
in O
the O
pales O
opposite O
the O
Parsonage O
. O
She O
was O
engaged O
one O
day O
as O
she O
walked O
, O
in O
re-perusing O
Jane O
's O
last O
letter O
, O
and O
dwelling O
on O
some O
passages O
which O
proved O
that O
Jane O
had O
not O
written O
in O
spirits O
, O
when O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
again O
surprised O
by O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
she O
saw O
on O
looking O
up O
that O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
was O
meeting O
her O
. O
Putting O
away O
the O
letter O
immediately O
and O
forcing O
a O
smile O
, O
she O
said O
, O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
before O
that O
you O
ever O
walked O
this O
way O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
been O
making O
the O
tour O
of O
the O
Park O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
as O
I O
generally O
do O
every O
year O
, O
and O
intend O
to O
close O
it O
with O
a O
call O
at O
the O
Parsonage O
. O
Are O
you O
going O
much O
farther O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
I O
should O
have O
turned O
in O
a O
moment O
. O
" O
And O
accordingly O
she O
did O
turn O
, O
and O
they O
walked O
towards O
the O
Parsonage O
together O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
certainly O
leave O
Kent O
on O
Saturday O
? O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
Yes O
-- O
if O
Darcy O
does O
not O
put O
it O
off O
again O
. O
But O
I O
am O
at O
his O
disposal O
. O
He O
arranges O
the O
business O
just O
as O
he O
pleases O
. O
" O
" O
And O
if O
not O
able O
to O
please O
himself O
in O
the O
arrangement O
, O
he O
has O
at O
least O
great O
pleasure O
in O
the O
power O
of O
choice O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
any O
body O
who O
seems O
more O
to O
enjoy O
the O
power O
of O
doing O
what O
he O
likes O
than O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
. O
" O
" O
He O
likes O
to O
have O
his O
own O
way O
very O
well O
, O
" O
replied O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
. O
" O
But O
so O
we O
all O
do O
. O
It O
is O
only O
that O
he O
has O
better O
means O
of O
having O
it O
than O
many O
others O
, O
because O
he O
is O
rich O
, O
and O
many O
others O
are O
poor O
. O
I O
speak O
feelingly O
. O
A O
younger O
son O
, O
you O
know O
, O
must O
be O
inured O
to O
self-denial O
and O
dependence O
. O
" O
" O
In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
younger O
son O
of O
an O
Earl O
can O
know O
very O
little O
of O
either O
. O
Now O
, O
seriously O
, O
what O
have O
you O
ever O
known O
of O
self-denial O
and O
dependence O
? O
When O
have O
you O
been O
prevented O
by O
want O
of O
money O
from O
going O
wherever O
you O
chose O
, O
or O
procuring O
any O
thing O
you O
had O
a O
fancy O
for O
? O
" O
" O
These O
are O
home O
questions O
-- O
and O
perhaps O
I O
can O
not O
say O
that O
I O
have O
experienced O
many O
hardships O
of O
that O
nature O
. O
But O
in O
matters O
of O
greater O
weight O
, O
I O
may O
suffer O
from O
the O
want O
of O
money O
. O
Younger O
sons O
can O
not O
marry O
where O
they O
like O
. O
" O
" O
Unless O
where O
they O
like O
women O
of O
fortune O
, O
which O
I O
think O
they O
very O
often O
do O
. O
" O
" O
Our O
habits O
of O
expence O
make O
us O
too O
dependant O
, O
and O
there O
are O
not O
many O
in O
my O
rank O
of O
life O
who O
can O
afford O
to O
marry O
without O
some O
attention O
to O
money O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
this O
, O
" O
thought O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
meant O
for O
me O
? O
" O
and O
she O
coloured O
at O
the O
idea O
; O
but O
, O
recovering O
herself O
, O
said O
in O
a O
lively O
tone O
, O
" O
And O
pray O
, O
what O
is O
the O
usual O
price O
of O
an O
Earl O
's O
younger O
son O
? O
Unless O
the O
elder O
brother O
is O
very O
sickly O
, O
I O
suppose O
you O
would O
not O
ask O
above O
fifty O
thousand O
pounds O
. O
" O
He O
answered O
her O
in O
the O
same O
style O
, O
and O
the O
subject O
dropped O
. O
To O
interrupt O
a O
silence O
which O
might O
make O
him O
fancy O
her O
affected O
with O
what O
had O
passed O
, O
she O
soon O
afterwards O
said O
, O
" O
I O
imagine O
your O
cousin O
brought O
you O
down O
with O
him O
chiefly O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
having O
somebody O
at O
his O
disposal O
. O
I O
wonder O
he O
does O
not O
marry O
, O
to O
secure O
a O
lasting O
convenience O
of O
that O
kind O
. O
But O
, O
perhaps O
his O
sister O
does O
as O
well O
for O
the O
present O
, O
and O
, O
as O
she O
is O
under O
his O
sole O
care O
, O
he O
may O
do O
what O
he O
likes O
with O
her O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
said O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
" O
that O
is O
an O
advantage O
which O
he O
must O
divide O
with O
me O
. O
I O
am O
joined O
with O
him O
in O
the O
guardianship O
of O
Miss O
Darcy O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
you O
, O
indeed O
? O
And O
pray O
what O
sort O
of O
guardians O
do O
you O
make O
? O
Does O
your O
charge O
give O
you O
much O
trouble O
? O
Young O
ladies O
of O
her O
age O
, O
are O
sometimes O
a O
little O
difficult O
to O
manage O
, O
and O
if O
she O
has O
the O
true O
Darcy O
spirit O
, O
she O
may O
like O
to O
have O
her O
own O
way O
. O
" O
As O
she O
spoke O
, O
she O
observed O
him O
looking O
at O
her O
earnestly O
, O
and O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
immediately O
asked O
her O
why O
she O
supposed O
Miss O
Darcy O
likely O
to O
give O
them O
any O
uneasiness O
, O
convinced O
her O
that O
she O
had O
somehow O
or O
other O
got O
pretty O
near O
the O
truth O
. O
She O
directly O
replied O
, O
" O
You O
need O
not O
be O
frightened O
. O
I O
never O
heard O
any O
harm O
of O
her O
; O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
she O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
tractable O
creatures O
in O
the O
world O
. O
She O
is O
a O
very O
great O
favourite O
with O
some O
ladies O
of O
my O
acquaintance O
, O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
. O
I O
think O
I O
have O
heard O
you O
say O
that O
you O
know O
them O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
them O
a O
little O
. O
Their O
brother O
is O
a O
pleasant O
gentleman-like O
man O
-- O
he O
is O
a O
great O
friend O
of O
Darcy O
's O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
yes O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
drily O
-- O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
is O
uncommonly O
kind O
to O
Mr O
. O
Bingley O
, O
and O
takes O
a O
prodigious O
deal O
of O
care O
of O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Care O
of O
him O
! O
-- O
Yes O
, O
I O
really O
believe O
Darcy O
_does_ O
take O
care O
of O
him O
in O
those O
points O
where O
he O
most O
wants O
care O
. O
From O
something O
that O
he O
told O
me O
in O
our O
journey O
hither O
, O
I O
have O
reason O
to O
think O
Bingley O
very O
much O
indebted O
to O
him O
. O
But O
I O
ought O
to O
beg O
his O
pardon O
, O
for O
I O
have O
no O
right O
to O
suppose O
that O
Bingley O
was O
the O
person O
meant O
. O
It O
was O
all O
conjecture O
. O
" O
" O
What O
is O
it O
you O
mean O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
a O
circumstance O
which O
Darcy O
of O
course O
would O
not O
wish O
to O
be O
generally O
known O
, O
because O
if O
it O
were O
to O
get O
round O
to O
the O
lady O
's O
family O
, O
it O
would O
be O
an O
unpleasant O
thing O
. O
" O
" O
You O
may O
depend O
upon O
my O
not O
mentioning O
it O
. O
" O
" O
And O
remember O
that O
I O
have O
not O
much O
reason O
for O
supposing O
it O
to O
be O
Bingley O
. O
What O
he O
told O
me O
was O
merely O
this O
; O
that O
he O
congratulated O
himself O
on O
having O
lately O
saved O
a O
friend O
from O
the O
inconveniences O
of O
a O
most O
imprudent O
marriage O
, O
but O
without O
mentioning O
names O
or O
any O
other O
particulars O
, O
and O
I O
only O
suspected O
it O
to O
be O
Bingley O
from O
believing O
him O
the O
kind O
of O
young O
man O
to O
get O
into O
a O
scrape O
of O
that O
sort O
, O
and O
from O
knowing O
them O
to O
have O
been O
together O
the O
whole O
of O
last O
summer O
. O
" O
" O
Did O
Mr. O
Darcy O
give O
you O
his O
reasons O
for O
this O
interference O
? O
" O
" O
I O
understood O
that O
there O
were O
some O
very O
strong O
objections O
against O
the O
lady O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
arts O
did O
he O
use O
to O
separate O
them O
? O
" O
" O
He O
did O
not O
talk O
to O
me O
of O
his O
own O
arts O
, O
" O
said O
Fitzwilliam O
smiling O
. O
" O
He O
only O
told O
me O
, O
what O
I O
have O
now O
told O
you O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
made O
no O
answer O
, O
and O
walked O
on O
, O
her O
heart O
swelling O
with O
indignation O
. O
After O
watching O
her O
a O
little O
, O
Fitzwilliam O
asked O
her O
why O
she O
was O
so O
thoughtful O
. O
" O
I O
am O
thinking O
of O
what O
you O
have O
been O
telling O
me O
, O
" O
said O
she O
. O
" O
Your O
cousin O
's O
conduct O
does O
not O
suit O
my O
feelings O
. O
Why O
was O
he O
to O
be O
the O
judge O
? O
" O
" O
You O
are O
rather O
disposed O
to O
call O
his O
interference O
officious O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
see O
what O
right O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
to O
decide O
on O
the O
propriety O
of O
his O
friend O
's O
inclination O
, O
or O
why O
, O
upon O
his O
own O
judgment O
alone O
, O
he O
was O
to O
determine O
and O
direct O
in O
what O
manner O
that O
friend O
was O
to O
be O
happy O
. O
" O
" O
But O
, O
" O
she O
continued O
, O
recollecting O
herself O
, O
" O
as O
we O
know O
none O
of O
the O
particulars O
, O
it O
is O
not O
fair O
to O
condemn O
him O
. O
It O
is O
not O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
there O
was O
much O
affection O
in O
the O
case O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
not O
an O
unnatural O
surmise O
, O
" O
said O
Fitzwilliam O
, O
" O
but O
it O
is O
lessening O
the O
honour O
of O
my O
cousin O
's O
triumph O
very O
sadly O
. O
" O
This O
was O
spoken O
jestingly O
, O
but O
it O
appeared O
to O
her O
so O
just O
a O
picture O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
that O
she O
would O
not O
trust O
herself O
with O
an O
answer O
; O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
abruptly O
changing O
the O
conversation O
, O
talked O
on O
indifferent O
matters O
till O
they O
reached O
the O
parsonage O
. O
There O
, O
shut O
into O
her O
own O
room O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
their O
visitor O
left O
them O
, O
she O
could O
think O
without O
interruption O
of O
all O
that O
she O
had O
heard O
. O
It O
was O
not O
to O
be O
supposed O
that O
any O
other O
people O
could O
be O
meant O
than O
those O
with O
whom O
she O
was O
connected O
. O
There O
could O
not O
exist O
in O
the O
world O
_two_ O
men O
, O
over O
whom O
Mr. O
Darcy O
could O
have O
such O
boundless O
influence O
. O
That O
he O
had O
been O
concerned O
in O
the O
measures O
taken O
to O
separate O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
Jane O
, O
she O
had O
never O
doubted O
; O
but O
she O
had O
always O
attributed O
to O
Miss O
Bingley O
the O
principal O
design O
and O
arrangement O
of O
them O
. O
If O
his O
own O
vanity O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
mislead O
him O
, O
_he_ O
was O
the O
cause O
, O
his O
pride O
and O
caprice O
were O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
that O
Jane O
had O
suffered O
, O
and O
still O
continued O
to O
suffer O
. O
He O
had O
ruined O
for O
a O
while O
every O
hope O
of O
happiness O
for O
the O
most O
affectionate O
, O
generous O
heart O
in O
the O
world O
; O
and O
no O
one O
could O
say O
how O
lasting O
an O
evil O
he O
might O
have O
inflicted O
. O
" O
There O
were O
some O
very O
strong O
objections O
against O
the O
lady O
, O
" O
were O
Colonel O
Fitzwilliam O
's O
words O
, O
and O
these O
strong O
objections O
probably O
were O
, O
her O
having O
one O
uncle O
who O
was O
a O
country O
attorney O
, O
and O
another O
who O
was O
in O
business O
in O
London O
. O
" O
To O
Jane O
herself O
, O
" O
she O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
there O
could O
be O
no O
possibility O
of O
objection O
. O
All O
loveliness O
and O
goodness O
as O
she O
is O
! O
Her O
understanding O
excellent O
, O
her O
mind O
improved O
, O
and O
her O
manners O
captivating O
. O
Neither O
could O
any O
thing O
be O
urged O
against O
my O
father O
, O
who O
, O
though O
with O
some O
peculiarities O
, O
has O
abilities O
which O
Mr. O
Darcy O
himself O
need O

" O
When O
she O
thought O
of O
her O
mother O
indeed O
, O
her O
confidence O
gave O
way O
a O
little O
, O
but O
she O
would O
not O
allow O
that O
any O
objections O
_there_ O
had O
material O
weight O
with O
Mr O

Darcy O
, O
whose O
pride O
, O
she O
was O
convinced O
, O
would O
receive O
a O
deeper O
wound O
from O
the O
want O
of O
importance O
in O
his O
friend O
's O
connections O
, O
than O
from O
their O
want O
of O
sense O
; O
and O
she O
was O
quite O
decided O
at O
last O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
partly O
governed O
by O
this O
worst O
kind O
of O
pride O

partly O
by O
the O
wish O

brought O
on O
a O
headache O
; O
and O
it O
grew O
so O
much O
worse O
towards O
the O
evening O
that O
, O
added O
to O
her O
unwillingness O
to O
see O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
it O
determined O
her O
not O
to O
attend O
her O
cousins O
to O
Rosings O
, O
where O
they O
were O
engaged O
to O
drink O
tea O

Mrs. O

, O
seeing O
that O
she O
was O
really O
unwell O
, O
did O
not O
press O
her O
to O
go O
, O
and O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
prevented O
her O
husband O
from O
pressing O
her O
, O

Mr. O
Collins O
could O
not O
conceal O
his O
apprehension O
of O
Lady O

being O
rather O
displeased O

her O
