It O
was O
the O
second O
week O
in O
May O
, O
in O
which O
the O
three O
young O
ladies O
set O
out O
together O
from O
Gracechurch-street O
, O
for O
the O
town O
of O
-- O
-- O
in O
Hertfordshire O
; O
and O
, O
as O
they O
drew O
near O
the O
appointed O
inn O
where O
Mr. O
Bennet O
's O
carriage O
was O
to O
meet O
them O
, O
they O
quickly O
perceived O
, O
in O
token O
of O
the O
coachman O
's O
punctuality O
, O
both O
Kitty O
and O
Lydia O
looking O
out O
of O
a O
dining-room O
up O
stairs O
. O
These O
two O
girls O
had O
been O
above O
an O
hour O
in O
the O
place O
, O
happily O
employed O
in O
visiting O
an O
opposite O
milliner O
, O
watching O
the O
sentinel O
on O
guard O
, O
and O
dressing O
a O
sallad O
and O
cucumber O
. O
After O
welcoming O
their O
sisters O
, O
they O
triumphantly O
displayed O
a O
table O
set O
out O
with O
such O
cold O
meat O
as O
an O
inn O
larder O
usually O
affords O
, O
exclaiming O
, O
" O
Is O
not O
this O
nice O
? O
is O
not O
this O
an O
agreeable O
surprise O
? O
" O
" O
And O
we O
mean O
to O
treat O
you O
all O
, O
" O
added O
Lydia O
; O
" O
but O
you O
must O
lend O
us O
the O
money O
, O
for O
we O
have O
just O
spent O
ours O
at O
the O
shop O
out O
there O
. O
" O
Then O
shewing O
her O
purchases O
: O
" O
Look O
here O
, O
I O
have O
bought O
this O
bonnet O
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
is O
very O
pretty O
; O
but O
I O
thought O
I O
might O
as O
well O
buy O
it O
as O
not O
. O
I O
shall O
pull O
it O
to O
pieces O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
get O
home O
, O
and O
see O
if O
I O
can O
make O
it O
up O
any O
better O
. O
" O
And O
when O
her O
sisters O
abused O
it O
as O
ugly O
, O
she O
added O
, O
with O
perfect O
unconcern O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
but O
there O
were O
two O
or O
three O
much O
uglier O
in O
the O
shop O
; O
and O
when O
I O
have O
bought O
some O
prettier-coloured O
satin O
to O
trim O
it O
with O
fresh O
, O
I O
think O
it O
will O
be O
very O
tolerable O
. O
Besides O
, O
it O
will O
not O
much O
signify O
what O
one O
wears O
this O
summer O
, O
after O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
have O
left O
Meryton O
, O
and O
they O
are O
going O
in O
a O
fortnight O
. O
" O
" O
Are O
they O
indeed O
? O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
with O
the O
greatest O
satisfaction O
. O
" O
They O
are O
going O
to O
be O
encamped O
near O
Brighton O
; O
and O
I O
do O
so O
want O
papa O
to O
take O
us O
all O
there O
for O
the O
summer O
! O
It O
would O
be O
such O
a O
delicious O
scheme O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
say O
would O
hardly O
cost O
any O
thing O
at O
all O
. O
Mamma O
would O
like O
to O
go O
too O
of O
all O
things O
! O
Only O
think O
what O
a O
miserable O
summer O
else O
we O
shall O
have O
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
thought O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
_that_ O
would O
be O
a O
delightful O
scheme O
, O
indeed O
, O
and O
completely O
do O
for O
us O
at O
once O
. O
Good O
Heaven O
! O
Brighton O
, O
and O
a O
whole O
campful O
of O
soldiers O
, O
to O
us O
, O
who O
have O
been O
overset O
already O
by O
one O
poor O
regiment O
of O
militia O
, O
and O
the O
monthly O
balls O
of O
Meryton O
. O
" O
" O
Now O
I O
have O
got O
some O
news O
for O
you O
, O
" O
said O
Lydia O
, O
as O
they O
sat O
down O
to O
table O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
It O
is O
excellent O
news O
, O
capital O
news O
, O
and O
about O
a O
certain O
person O
that O
we O
all O
like O
. O
" O
Jane O
and O
Elizabeth O
looked O
at O
each O
other O
, O
and O
the O
waiter O
was O
told O
that O
he O
need O
not O
stay O
. O
Lydia O
laughed O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Aye O
, O
that O
is O
just O
like O
your O
formality O
and O
discretion O
. O
You O
thought O
the O
waiter O
must O
not O
hear O
, O
as O
if O
he O
cared O
! O
I O
dare O
say O
he O
often O
hears O
worse O
things O
said O
than O
I O
am O
going O
to O
say O
. O
But O
he O
is O
an O
ugly O
fellow O
! O
I O
am O
glad O
he O
is O
gone O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
long O
chin O
in O
my O
life O
. O
Well O
, O
but O
now O
for O
my O
news O
: O
it O
is O
about O
dear O
Wickham O
; O
too O
good O
for O
the O
waiter O
, O
is O
not O
it O
? O
There O
is O
no O
danger O
of O
Wickham O
's O
marrying O
Mary O
King O
. O
There O
's O
for O
you O
! O
She O
is O
gone O
down O
to O
her O
uncle O
at O
Liverpool O
; O
gone O
to O
stay O
. O
Wickham O
is O
safe O
. O
" O
" O
And O
Mary O
King O
is O
safe O
! O
" O
added O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
safe O
from O
a O
connection O
imprudent O
as O
to O
fortune O
. O
" O
" O
She O
is O
a O
great O
fool O
for O
going O
away O
, O
if O
she O
liked O
him O
. O
" O
" O
But O
I O
hope O
there O
is O
no O
strong O
attachment O
on O
either O
side O
, O
" O
said O
Jane O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
there O
is O
not O
on O
_his_ O
. O
I O
will O
answer O
for O
it O
he O
never O
cared O
three O
straws O
about O
her O
. O
Who O
_could_ O
about O
such O
a O
nasty O
little O
freckled O
thing O
? O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
shocked O
to O
think O
that O
, O
however O
incapable O
of O
such O
coarseness O
of O
_expression_ O
herself O
, O
the O
coarseness O
of O
the O
_sentiment_ O
was O
little O
other O
than O
her O
own O
breast O
had O
formerly O
harboured O
and O
fancied O
liberal O
! O
As O
soon O
as O
all O
had O
ate O
, O
and O
the O
elder O
ones O
paid O
, O
the O
carriage O
was O
ordered O
; O
and O
after O
some O
contrivance O
, O
the O
whole O
party O
, O
with O
all O
their O
boxes O
, O
workbags O
, O
and O
parcels O
, O
and O
the O
unwelcome O
addition O
of O
Kitty O
's O
and O
Lydia O
's O
purchases O
, O
were O
seated O
in O
it O
. O
" O
How O
nicely O
we O
are O
crammed O
in O
! O
" O
cried O
Lydia O
. O
" O
I O
am O
glad O
I O
bought O
my O
bonnet O
, O
if O
it O
is O
only O
for O
the O
fun O
of O
having O
another O
bandbox O
! O
Well O
, O
now O
let O
us O
be O
quite O
comfortable O
and O
snug O
, O
and O
talk O
and O
laugh O
all O
the O
way O
home O
. O
And O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
let O
us O
hear O
what O
has O
happened O
to O
you O
all O
, O
since O
you O
went O
away O
. O
Have O
you O
seen O
any O
pleasant O
men O
? O
Have O
you O
had O
any O
flirting O
? O
I O
was O
in O
great O
hopes O
that O
one O
of O
you O
would O
have O
got O
a O
husband O
before O
you O
came O
back O
. O
Jane O
will O
be O
quite O
an O
old O
maid O
soon O
, O
I O
declare O
. O
She O
is O
almost O
three O
and O
twenty O
! O
Lord O
, O
how O
ashamed O
I O
should O
be O
of O
not O
being O
married O
before O
three O
and O
twenty O
! O
My O
aunt O
Philips O
wants O
you O
so O
to O
get O
husbands O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
think O
. O
She O
says O
Lizzy O
had O
better O
have O
taken O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
; O
but O
_I_ O
do O
not O
think O
there O
would O
have O
been O
any O
fun O
in O
it O
. O
Lord O
! O
how O
I O
should O
like O
to O
be O
married O
before O
any O
of O
you O
; O
and O
then O
I O
would O
chaperon O
you O
about O
to O
all O
the O
balls O
. O
Dear O
me O
! O
we O
had O
such O
a O
good O
piece O
of O
fun O
the O
other O
day O
at O
Colonel O
Forster O
's O
. O
Kitty O
and O
me O
were O
to O
spend O
the O
day O
there O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Forster O
promised O
to O
have O
a O
little O
dance O
in O
the O
evening O
; O
( O
by O
the O
bye O
, O
Mrs. O
Forster O
and O
me O
are O
_such_ O
friends O
! O
) O
and O
so O
she O
asked O
the O
two O
Harringtons O
to O
come O
, O
but O
Harriet O
was O
ill O
, O
and O
so O
Pen O
was O
forced O
to O
come O
by O
herself O
; O
and O
then O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
we O
did O
? O
We O
dressed O
up O
Chamberlayne O
in O
woman O
's O
clothes O
, O
on O
purpose O
to O
pass O
for O
a O
lady O
, O
-- O
only O
think O
what O
fun O
! O
Not O
a O
soul O
knew O
of O
it O
, O
but O
Col. O
and O
Mrs O
. O
Forster O
, O
and O
Kitty O
and O
me O
, O
except O
my O
aunt O
, O
for O
we O
were O
forced O
to O
borrow O
one O
of O
her O
gowns O
; O
and O
you O
can O
not O
imagine O
how O
well O
he O
looked O
! O
When O
Denny O
, O
and O
Wickham O
, O
and O
Pratt O
, O
and O
two O
or O
three O
more O
of O
the O
men O
came O
in O
, O
they O
did O
not O
know O
him O
in O
the O
least O
. O
Lord O
! O
how O
I O
laughed O
! O
and O
so O
did O
Mrs O
. O
Forster O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
should O
have O
died O
. O
And O
_that_ O
made O
the O
men O
suspect O
something O
, O
and O
then O
they O
soon O
found O
out O
what O
was O
the O
matter O
. O
" O
With O
such O
kind O
of O
histories O
of O
their O
parties O
and O
good O
jokes O
, O
did O
Lydia O
, O
assisted O
by O
Kitty O
's O
hints O
and O
additions O
, O
endeavour O
to O
amuse O
her O
companions O
all O
the O
way O
to O
Longbourn O
. O
Elizabeth O
listened O
as O
little O
as O
she O
could O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
escaping O
the O
frequent O
mention O
of O
Wickham O
's O
name O
. O
Their O
reception O
at O
home O
was O
most O
kind O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
rejoiced O
to O
see O
Jane O
in O
undiminished O
beauty O
; O
and O
more O
than O
once O
during O
dinner O
did O
Mr. O
Bennet O
say O
voluntarily O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
I O
am O
glad O
you O
are O
come O
back O
, O
Lizzy O
. O
" O
Their O
party O
in O
the O
dining-room O
was O
large O
, O
for O
almost O
all O
the O
Lucases O
came O
to O
meet O
Maria O
and O
hear O
the O
news O
: O
and O
various O
were O
the O
subjects O
which O
occupied O
them O
; O
lady O
Lucas O
was O
enquiring O
of O
Maria O
across O
the O
table O
, O
after O
the O
welfare O
and O
poultry O
of O
her O
eldest O
daughter O
; O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
doubly O
engaged O
, O
on O
one O
hand O
collecting O
an O
account O
of O
the O
present O
fashions O
from O
Jane O
, O
who O
sat O
some O
way O
below O
her O
, O
and O
on O
the O
other O
, O
retailing O
them O
all O
to O
the O
younger O
Miss O
Lucases O
; O
and O
Lydia O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
rather O
louder O
than O
any O
other O
person O
's O
, O
was O
enumerating O
the O
various O
pleasures O
of O
the O
morning O
to O
any O
body O
who O
would O
hear O
her O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
Mary O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
wish O
you O
had O
gone O
with O
us O
, O
for O
we O
had O
such O
fun O
! O
as O
we O
went O
along O
, O
Kitty O
and O
me O
drew O
up O
all O
the O
blinds O
, O
and O
pretended O
there O
was O
nobody O
in O
the O
coach O
; O
and O
I O
should O
have O
gone O
so O
all O
the O
way O
, O
if O
Kitty O
had O
not O
been O
sick O
; O
and O
when O
we O
got O
to O
the O
George O
, O
I O
do O
think O
we O
behaved O
very O
handsomely O
, O
for O
we O
treated O
the O
other O
three O
with O
the O
nicest O
cold O
luncheon O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
if O
you O
would O
have O
gone O
, O
we O
would O
have O
treated O
you O
too O
. O
And O
then O
when O
we O
came O
away O
it O
was O
such O
fun O
! O
I O
thought O
we O
never O
should O
have O
got O
into O
the O
coach O
. O
I O
was O
ready O
to O
die O
of O
laughter O
. O
And O
then O
we O
were O
so O
merry O
all O
the O
way O
home O
! O
we O
talked O
and O
laughed O
so O
loud O
, O
that O
any O
body O
might O
have O
heard O
us O
ten O
miles O
off O
! O
" O
To O
this O
, O
Mary O
very O
gravely O
replied O
, O
" O
Far O
be O
it O
from O
me O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
, O
to O
depreciate O
such O
pleasures O
. O
They O
would O
doubtless O
be O
congenial O
with O
the O
generality O
of O
female O
minds O
. O
But O
I O
confess O
they O
would O
have O
no O
charms O
for O
_me_ O
. O
I O
should O
infinitely O
prefer O
a O
book O
. O
" O
But O
of O
this O
answer O
Lydia O
heard O
not O
a O
word O
. O
She O
seldom O
listened O
to O
any O
body O
for O
more O
than O
half O
a O
minute O
, O
and O
never O
attended O
to O
Mary O
at O
all O
. O
In O
the O
afternoon O
Lydia O
was O
urgent O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
girls O
to O
walk O
to O
Meryton O
and O
see O
how O
every O
body O
went O
on O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
steadily O
opposed O
the O
scheme O
. O
It O
should O
not O
be O
said O
, O
that O
the O
Miss O
Bennets O
could O
not O
be O
at O
home O
half O
a O
day O
before O
they O
were O
in O
pursuit O
of O
the O
officers O
. O
There O
was O
another O
reason O
too O
for O
her O
opposition O
. O
She O
dreaded O
seeing O
Wickham O
again O
, O
and O
was O
resolved O
to O
avoid O
it O
as O
long O
as O
possible O
. O
The O
comfort O
to O
_her_ O
, O
of O
the O
regiment O
's O
approaching O
removal O
, O
was O
indeed O
beyond O
expression O
. O
In O
a O
fortnight O
they O
were O
to O
go O
, O
and O
once O
gone O
, O
she O
hoped O
there O
could O
be O
nothing O
more O
to O
plague O
her O
on O
his O
account O
. O
She O
had O
not O
been O
many O
hours O
at O
home O
, O
before O
she O
found O
that O
the O
Brighton O
scheme O
, O
of O
which O
Lydia O
had O
given O
them O
a O
hint O
at O
the O
inn O
, O
was O
under O
frequent O
discussion O
between O
her O
parents O
. O
Elizabeth O
saw O
directly O
that O
her O
father O
had O
not O
the O
smallest O
intention O
of O
yielding O
; O
but O
his O
answers O
were O
at O
the O
same O
time O
so O
vague O
and O
equivocal O
, O
that O
her O
mother O
, O
though O
often O
disheartened O
, O
had O
never O
yet O
despaired O
of O
succeeding O
at O
last O
. O
