The O
discomposure O
of O
spirits O
, O
which O
this O
extraordinary O
visit O
threw O
Elizabeth O
into O
, O
could O
not O
be O
easily O
overcome O
; O
nor O
could O
she O
for O
many O
hours O
, O
learn O
to O
think O
of O
it O
less O
than O
incessantly O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
it O
appeared O
, O
had O
actually O
taken O
the O
trouble O
of O
this O
journey O
from O
Rosings O
, O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
breaking O
off O
her O
supposed O
engagement O
with O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
. O
It O
was O
a O
rational O
scheme O
to O
be O
sure O
! O
but O
from O
what O
the O
report O
of O
their O
engagement O
could O
originate O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
imagine O
; O
till O
she O
recollected O
that O
_his_ O
being O
the O
intimate O
friend O
of O
Bingley O
, O
and O
_her_ O
being O
the O
sister O
of O
Jane O
, O
was O
enough O
, O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
expectation O
of O
one O
wedding O
, O
made O
every O
body O
eager O
for O
another O
, O
to O
supply O
the O
idea O
. O
She O
had O
not O
herself O
forgotten O
to O
feel O
that O
the O
marriage O
of O
her O
sister O
must O
bring O
them O
more O
frequently O
together O
. O
And O
her O
neighbours O
at O
Lucas O
lodge O
, O
therefore O
, O
( O
for O
through O
their O
communication O
with O
the O
Collinses O
, O
the O
report O
she O
concluded O
had O
reached O
lady O
Catherine O
) O
had O
only O
set O
_that_ O
down O
, O
as O
almost O
certain O
and O
immediate O
, O
which O
_she_ O
had O
looked O
forward O
to O
as O
possible O
, O
at O
some O
future O
time O
. O
In O
revolving O
lady O
Catherine O
's O
expressions O
, O
however O
, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
feeling O
some O
uneasiness O
as O
to O
the O
possible O
consequence O
of O
her O
persisting O
in O
this O
interference O
. O
From O
what O
she O
had O
said O
of O
her O
resolution O
to O
prevent O
their O
marriage O
, O
it O
occurred O
to O
Elizabeth O
that O
she O
must O
meditate O
an O
application O
to O
her O
nephew O
; O
and O
how O
_he_ O
might O
take O
a O
similar O
representation O
of O
the O
evils O
attached O
to O
a O
connection O
with O
her O
, O
she O
dared O
not O
pronounce O
. O
She O
knew O
not O
the O
exact O
degree O
of O
his O
affection O
for O
his O
aunt O
, O
or O
his O
dependence O
on O
her O
judgment O
, O
but O
it O
was O
natural O
to O
suppose O
that O
he O
thought O
much O
higher O
of O
her O
ladyship O
than O
_she_ O
could O
do O
; O
and O
it O
was O
certain O
, O
that O
in O
enumerating O
the O
miseries O
of O
a O
marriage O
with O
_one_ O
, O
whose O
immediate O
connections O
were O
so O
unequal O
to O
his O
own O
, O
his O
aunt O
would O
address O
him O
on O
his O
weakest O
side O
. O
With O
his O
notions O
of O
dignity O
, O
he O
would O
probably O
feel O
that O
the O
arguments O
, O
which O
to O
Elizabeth O
had O
appeared O
weak O
and O
ridiculous O
, O
contained O
much O
good O
sense O
and O
solid O
reasoning O
. O
If O
he O
had O
been O
wavering O
before O
, O
as O
to O
what O
he O
should O
do O
, O
which O
had O
often O
seemed O
likely O
, O
the O
advice O
and O
intreaty O
of O
so O
near O
a O
relation O
might O
settle O
every O
doubt O
, O
and O
determine O
him O
at O
once O
to O
be O
as O
happy O
, O
as O
dignity O
unblemished O
could O
make O
him O
. O
In O
that O
case O
he O
would O
return O
no O
more O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
might O
see O
him O
in O
her O
way O
through O
town O
; O
and O
his O
engagement O
to O
Bingley O
of O
coming O
again O
to O
Netherfield O
must O
give O
way O
. O
" O
If O
, O
therefore O
, O
an O
excuse O
for O
not O
keeping O
his O
promise O
, O
should O
come O
to O
his O
friend O
within O
a O
few O
days O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
know O
how O
to O
understand O
it O
. O
I O
shall O
then O
give O
over O
every O
expectation O
, O
every O
wish O
of O
his O
constancy O
. O
If O
he O
is O
satisfied O
with O
only O
regretting O
me O
, O
when O
he O
might O
have O
obtained O
my O
affections O
and O
hand O
, O
I O
shall O
soon O
cease O
to O
regret O
him O
at O
all O
. O

The O
surprise O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
, O
on O
hearing O
who O
their O
visitor O
had O
been O
, O
was O
very O
great O
; O
but O
they O
obligingly O
satisfied O
it O
, O
with O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
supposition O
, O
which O
had O
appeased O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
curiosity O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
spared O
from O
much O
teazing O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
, O
as O
she O
was O
going O
down O
stairs O
, O
she O
was O
met O
by O
her O
father O
, O
who O
came O
out O
of O
his O
library O
with O
a O
letter O
in O
his O
hand O
. O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
I O
was O
going O
to O
look O
for O
you O
; O
come O
into O
my O
room O
. O
" O
She O
followed O
him O
thither O
; O
and O
her O
curiosity O
to O
know O
what O
he O
had O
to O
tell O
her O
, O
was O
heightened O
by O
the O
supposition O
of O
its O
being O
in O
some O
manner O
connected O
with O
the O
letter O
he O
held O
. O
It O
suddenly O
struck O
her O
that O
it O
might O
be O
from O
lady O
Catherine O
; O
and O
she O
anticipated O
with O
dismay O
all O
the O
consequent O
explanations O
. O
She O
followed O
her O
father O
to O
the O
fire O
place O
, O
and O
they O
both O
sat O
down O
. O
He O
then O
said O
, O
" O
I O
have O
received O
a O
letter O
this O
morning O
that O
has O
astonished O
me O
exceedingly O
. O
As O
it O
principally O
concerns O
yourself O
, O
you O
ought O
to O
know O
its O
contents O
. O
I O
did O
not O
know O
before O
, O
that O
I O
had O
_two_ O
daughters O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
matrimony O
. O
Let O
me O
congratulate O
you O
, O
on O
a O
very O
important O
conquest O
. O
" O
The O
colour O
now O
rushed O
into O
Elizabeth O
's O
cheeks O
in O
the O
instantaneous O
conviction O
of O
its O
being O
a O
letter O
from O
the O
nephew O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
aunt O
; O
and O
she O
was O
undetermined O
whether O
most O
to O
be O
pleased O
that O
he O
explained O
himself O
at O
all O
, O
or O
offended O
that O
his O
letter O
was O
not O
rather O
addressed O
to O
herself O
; O
when O
her O
father O
continued O
, O
" O
You O
look O
conscious O
. O
Young O
ladies O
have O
great O
penetration O
in O
such O
matters O
as O
these O
; O
but O
I O
think O
I O
may O
defy O
even O
_your_ O
sagacity O
, O
to O
discover O
the O
name O
of O
your O
admirer O
. O
This O
letter O
is O
from O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
. O
" O
" O
From O
Mr. O
Collins O
! O
and O
what O
can O
_he_ O
have O
to O
say O
? O
" O
" O
Something O
very O
much O
to O
the O
purpose O
of O
course O
. O
He O
begins O
with O
congratulations O
on O
the O
approaching O
nuptials O
of O
my O
eldest O
daughter O
, O
of O
which O
it O
seems O
he O
has O
been O
told O
, O
by O
some O
of O
the O
good-natured O
, O
gossiping O
Lucases O
. O
I O
shall O
not O
sport O
with O
your O
impatience O
, O
by O
reading O
what O
he O
says O
on O
that O
point O
. O
What O
relates O
to O
yourself O
, O
is O
as O
follows O
. O
" O
Having O
thus O
offered O
you O
the O
sincere O
congratulations O
of O
Mrs. O
Collins O
and O
myself O
on O
this O
happy O
event O
, O
let O
me O
now O
add O
a O
short O
hint O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
another O
: O
of O
which O
we O
have O
been O
advertised O
by O
the O
same O
authority O
. O
Your O
daughter O
Elizabeth O
, O
it O
is O
presumed O
, O
will O
not O
long O
bear O
the O
name O
of O
Bennet O
, O
after O
her O
elder O
sister O
has O
resigned O
it O
, O
and O
the O
chosen O
partner O
of O
her O
fate O
, O
may O
be O
reasonably O
looked O
up O
to O
, O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
illustrious O
personages O
in O
this O
land O
. O
" O
" O
Can O
you O
possibly O
guess O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
who O
is O
meant O
by O
this O
? O
" O
" O
This O
young O
gentleman O
is O
blessed O
in O
a O
peculiar O
way O
, O
with O
every O
thing O
the O
heart O
of O
mortal O
can O
most O
desire O
, O
-- O
splendid O
property O
, O
noble O
kindred O
, O
and O
extensive O
patronage O
. O
Yet O
in O
spite O
of O
all O
these O
temptations O
, O
let O
me O
warn O
my O
cousin O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
yourself O
, O
of O
what O
evils O
you O
may O
incur O
, O
by O
a O
precipitate O
closure O
with O
this O
gentleman O
's O
proposals O
, O
which O
, O
of O
course O
, O
you O
will O
be O
inclined O
to O
take O
immediate O
advantage O
of O
. O
" O
" O
Have O
you O
any O
idea O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
who O
this O
gentleman O
is O
? O
But O
now O
it O
comes O
out O
. O
" O
" O
My O
motive O
for O
cautioning O
you O
, O
is O
as O
follows O
. O
We O
have O
reason O
to O
imagine O
that O
his O
aunt O
, O
lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
does O
not O
look O
on O
the O
match O
with O
a O
friendly O
eye O
. O
" O
" O
_Mr O
. O
Darcy_ O
, O
you O
see O
, O
is O
the O
man O
! O
Now O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
I O
think O
I O
_have_ O
surprised O
you O
. O
Could O
he O
, O
or O
the O
Lucases O
, O
have O
pitched O
on O
any O
man O
, O
within O
the O
circle O
of O
our O
acquaintance O
, O
whose O
name O
would O
have O
given O
the O
lie O
more O
effectually O
to O
what O
they O
related O
? O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
who O
never O
looks O
at O
any O
woman O
but O
to O
see O
a O
blemish O
, O
and O
who O
probably O
never O
looked O
at O
_you_ O
in O
his O
life O
! O
It O
is O
admirable O
! O
" O
Elizabeth O
tried O
to O
join O
in O
her O
father O
's O
pleasantry O
, O
but O
could O
only O
force O
one O
most O
reluctant O
smile O
. O
Never O
had O
his O
wit O
been O
directed O
in O
a O
manner O
so O
little O
agreeable O
to O
her O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
not O
diverted O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
yes O
. O
Pray O
read O
on O
. O
" O
" O
After O
mentioning O
the O
likelihood O
of O
this O
marriage O
to O
her O
ladyship O
last O
night O
, O
she O
immediately O
, O
with O
her O
usual O
condescension O
, O
expressed O
what O
she O
felt O
on O
the O
occasion O
; O
when O
it O
became O
apparent O
, O
that O
on O
the O
score O
of O
some O
family O
objections O
on O
the O
part O
of O
my O
cousin O
, O
she O
would O
never O
give O
her O
consent O
to O
what O
she O
termed O
so O
disgraceful O
a O
match O
. O
I O
thought O
it O
my O
duty O
to O
give O
the O
speediest O
intelligence O
of O
this O
to O
my O
cousin O
, O
that O
she O
and O
her O
noble O
admirer O
may O
be O
aware O
of O
what O
they O
are O
about O
, O
and O
not O
run O
hastily O
into O
a O
marriage O
which O
has O
not O
been O
properly O
sanctioned O
. O
" O
" O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
moreover O
adds O
, O
" O
" O
I O
am O
truly O
rejoiced O
that O
my O
cousin O
Lydia O
's O
sad O
business O
has O
been O
so O
well O
hushed O
up O
, O
and O
am O
only O
concerned O
that O
their O
living O
together O
before O
the O
marriage O
took O
place O
, O
should O
be O
so O
generally O
known O
. O
I O
must O
not O
, O
however O
, O
neglect O
the O
duties O
of O
my O
station O
, O
or O
refrain O
from O
declaring O
my O
amazement O
, O
at O
hearing O
that O
you O
received O
the O
young O
couple O
into O
your O
house O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
were O
married O
. O
It O
was O
an O
encouragement O
of O
vice O
; O
and O
had O
I O
been O
the O
rector O
of O
Longbourn O
, O
I O
should O
very O
strenuously O
have O
opposed O
it O
. O
You O
ought O
certainly O
to O
forgive O
them O
as O
a O
christian O
, O
but O
never O
to O
admit O
them O
in O
your O
sight O
, O
or O
allow O
their O
names O
to O
be O
mentioned O
in O
your O
hearing O
. O
" O
" O
_That_ O
is O
his O
notion O
of O
christian O
forgiveness O
! O
The O
rest O
of O
his O
letter O
is O
only O
about O
his O
dear O
Charlotte O
's O
situation O
, O
and O
his O
expectation O
of O
a O
young O
olive-branch O
. O
But O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
you O
look O
as O
if O
you O
did O
not O
enjoy O
it O
. O
You O
are O
not O
going O
to O
be O
_Missish_ O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
and O
pretend O
to O
be O
affronted O
at O
an O
idle O
report O
. O
For O
what O
do O
we O
live O
, O
but O
to O
make O
sport O
for O
our O
neighbours O
, O
and O
laugh O
at O
them O
in O
our O
turn O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
I O
am O
excessively O
diverted O
. O
But O
it O
is O
so O
strange O
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
-- O
_that_ O
is O
what O
makes O
it O
amusing O
. O
Had O
they O
fixed O
on O
any O
other O
man O
it O
would O
have O
been O
nothing O
; O
but O
_his_ O
perfect O
indifference O
, O
and O
_your_ O
pointed O
dislike O
, O
make O
it O
so O
delightfully O
absurd O
! O
Much O
as O
I O
abominate O
writing O
, O
I O
would O
not O
give O
up O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
correspondence O
for O
any O
consideration O
. O
Nay O
, O
when O
I O
read O
a O
letter O
of O
his O
, O
I O
can O
not O
help O
giving O
him O
the O
preference O
even O
over O
Wickham O
, O
much O
as O
I O
value O
the O
impudence O
and O
hypocrisy O
of O
my O
son-in-law O
. O
And O
pray O
, O
Lizzy O
, O
what O
said O
Lady O
Catherine O
about O
this O
report O
? O
Did O
she O
call O
to O
refuse O
her O
consent O
? O
" O
To O
this O
question O
his O
daughter O
replied O
only O
with O
a O
laugh O
; O
and O
as O
it O
had O
been O
asked O
without O
the O
least O
suspicion O
, O
she O
was O
not O
distressed O
by O
his O
repeating O
it O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
never O
been O
more O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
make O
her O
feelings O
appear O
what O
they O
were O
not O
. O
It O
was O
necessary O
to O
laugh O
, O
when O
she O
would O
rather O
have O
cried O
. O
Her O
father O
had O
most O
cruelly O
mortified O
her O
, O
by O
what O
he O
said O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
indifference O
, O
and O
she O
could O
do O
nothing O
but O
wonder O
at O
such O
a O
want O
of O
penetration O
, O
or O
fear O
that O
perhaps O
, O
instead O
of O
his O
seeing O
too O
_little_ O
, O
she O
might O
have O
fancied O
too O
_much_ O
. O
