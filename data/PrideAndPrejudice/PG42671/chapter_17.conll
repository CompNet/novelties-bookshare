Elizabeth O
related O
to O
Jane O
the O
next O
day O
, O
what O
had O
passed O
between O
Mr O
. O
Wickham O
and O
herself O
. O
Jane O
listened O
with O
astonishment O
and O
concern O
; O
-- O
she O
knew O
not O
how O
to O
believe O
that O
Mr. O
Darcy O
could O
be O
so O
unworthy O
of O
Mr O
. O
Bingley O
's O
regard O
; O
and O
yet O
, O
it O
was O
not O
in O
her O
nature O
to O
question O
the O
veracity O
of O
a O
young O
man O
of O
such O
amiable O
appearance O
as O
Wickham. O
-- O
The O
possibility O
of O
his O
having O
really O
endured O
such O
unkindness O
, O
was O
enough O
to O
interest O
all O
her O
tender O
feelings O
; O
and O
nothing O
therefore O
remained O
to O
be O
done O
, O
but O
to O
think O
well O
of O
them O
both O
, O
to O
defend O
the O
conduct O
of O
each O
, O
and O
throw O
into O
the O
account O
of O
accident O
or O
mistake O
, O
whatever O
could O
not O
be O
otherwise O
explained O
. O
" O
They O
have O
both O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
been O
deceived O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
in O
some O
way O
or O
other O
, O
of O
which O
we O
can O
form O
no O
idea O
. O
Interested O
people O
have O
perhaps O
misrepresented O
each O
to O
the O
other O
. O
It O
is O
, O
in O
short O
, O
impossible O
for O
us O
to O
conjecture O
the O
causes O
or O
circumstances O
which O
may O
have O
alienated O
them O
, O
without O
actual O
blame O
on O
either O
side O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
true O
, O
indeed O
; O
-- O
and O
now O
, O
my O
dear O
Jane O
, O
what O
have O
you O
got O
to O
say O
in O
behalf O
of O
the O
interested O
people O
who O
have O
probably O
been O
concerned O
in O
the O
business O
? O
-- O
Do O
clear O
_them_ O
too O
, O
or O
we O
shall O
be O
obliged O
to O
think O
ill O
of O
somebody O
. O
" O
" O
Laugh O
as O
much O
as O
you O
chuse O
, O
but O
you O
will O
not O
laugh O
me O
out O
of O
my O
opinion O
. O
My O
dearest O
Lizzy O
, O
do O
but O
consider O
in O
what O
a O
disgraceful O
light O
it O
places O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
to O
be O
treating O
his O
father O
's O
favourite O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
, O
-- O
one O
, O
whom O
his O
father O
had O
promised O
to O
provide O
for. O
-- O
It O
is O
impossible O
. O
No O
man O
of O
common O
humanity O
, O
no O
man O
who O
had O
any O
value O
for O
his O
character O
, O
could O
be O
capable O
of O
it O
. O
Can O
his O
most O
intimate O
friends O
be O
so O
excessively O
deceived O
in O
him O
? O
oh O
! O
no O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
much O
more O
easily O
believe O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
being O
imposed O
on O
, O
than O
that O
Mr. O
Wickham O
should O
invent O
such O
a O
history O
of O
himself O
as O
he O
gave O
me O
last O
night O
; O
names O
, O
facts O
, O
every O
thing O
mentioned O
without O
ceremony. O
-- O
If O
it O
be O
not O
so O
, O
let O
Mr. O
Darcy O
contradict O
it O
. O
Besides O
, O
there O
was O
truth O
in O
his O
looks O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
difficult O
indeed O
-- O
it O
is O
distressing. O
-- O
One O
does O
not O
know O
what O
to O
think O
. O
" O
" O
I O
beg O
your O
pardon O
; O
-- O
one O
knows O
exactly O
what O
to O
think O
. O
" O
But O
Jane O
could O
think O
with O
certainty O
on O
only O
one O
point O
, O
-- O
that O
Mr O
. O
Bingley O
, O
if O
he O
_had O
been_ O
imposed O
on O
, O
would O
have O
much O
to O
suffer O
when O
the O
affair O
became O
public O
. O
The O
two O
young O
ladies O
were O
summoned O
from O
the O
shrubbery O
where O
this O
conversation O
passed O
, O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
some O
of O
the O
very O
persons O
of O
whom O
they O
had O
been O
speaking O
; O
Mr. O
Bingley O
and O
his O
sisters O
came O
to O
give O
their O
personal O
invitation O
for O
the O
long O
expected O
ball O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
which O
was O
fixed O
for O
the O
following O
Tuesday O
. O
The O
two O
ladies O
were O
delighted O
to O
see O
their O
dear O
friend O
again O
, O
called O
it O
an O
age O
since O
they O
had O
met O
, O
and O
repeatedly O
asked O
what O
she O
had O
been O
doing O
with O
herself O
since O
their O
separation O
. O
To O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
they O
paid O
little O
attention O
; O
avoiding O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
saying O
not O
much O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
nothing O
at O
all O
to O
the O
others O
. O
They O
were O
soon O
gone O
again O
, O
rising O
from O
their O
seats O
with O
an O
activity O
which O
took O
their O
brother O
by O
surprise O
, O
and O
hurrying O
off O
as O
if O
eager O
to O
escape O
from O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
's O
civilities O
. O
The O
prospect O
of O
the O
Netherfield O
ball O
was O
extremely O
agreeable O
to O
every O
female O
of O
the O
family O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
chose O
to O
consider O
it O
as O
given O
in O
compliment O
to O
her O
eldest O
daughter O
, O
and O
was O
particularly O
flattered O
by O
receiving O
the O
invitation O
from O
Mr. O
Bingley O
himself O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
ceremonious O
card O
. O
Jane O
pictured O
to O
herself O
a O
happy O
evening O
in O
the O
society O
of O
her O
two O
friends O
, O
and O
the O
attentions O
of O
their O
brother O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
thought O
with O
pleasure O
of O
dancing O
a O
great O
deal O
with O
Mr O
. O
Wickham O
, O
and O
of O
seeing O
a O
confirmation O
of O
every O
thing O
in O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
looks O
and O
behaviour O
. O
The O
happiness O
anticipated O
by O
Catherine O
and O
Lydia O
, O
depended O
less O
on O
any O
single O
event O
, O
or O
any O
particular O
person O
, O
for O
though O
they O
each O
, O
like O
Elizabeth O
, O
meant O
to O
dance O
half O
the O
evening O
with O
Mr O
. O
Wickham O
, O
he O
was O
by O
no O
means O
the O
only O
partner O
who O
could O
satisfy O
them O
, O
and O
a O
ball O
was O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
a O
ball O
. O
And O
even O
Mary O
could O
assure O
her O
family O
that O
she O
had O
no O
disinclination O
for O
it O
. O
" O
While O
I O
can O
have O
my O
mornings O
to O
myself O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
it O
is O
enough. O
-- O
I O
think O
it O
no O
sacrifice O
to O
join O
occasionally O
in O
evening O
engagements O
. O
Society O
has O
claims O
on O
us O
all O
; O
and O
I O
profess O
myself O
one O
of O
those O
who O
consider O
intervals O
of O
recreation O
and O
amusement O
as O
desirable O
for O
every O
body O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
's O
spirits O
were O
so O
high O
on O
the O
occasion O
, O
that O
though O
she O
did O
not O
often O
speak O
unnecessarily O
to O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
she O
could O
not O
help O
asking O
him O
whether O
he O
intended O
to O
accept O
Mr. O
Bingley O
's O
invitation O
, O
and O
if O
he O
did O
, O
whether O
he O
would O
think O
it O
proper O
to O
join O
in O
the O
evening O
's O
amusement O
; O
and O
she O
was O
rather O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
he O
entertained O
no O
scruple O
whatever O
on O
that O
head O
, O
and O
was O
very O
far O
from O
dreading O
a O
rebuke O
either O
from O
the O
Archbishop O
, O
or O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
by O
venturing O
to O
dance O
. O
" O
I O
am O
by O
no O
means O
of O
opinion O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
that O
a O
ball O
of O
this O
kind O
, O
given O
by O
a O
young O
man O
of O
character O
, O
to O
respectable O
people O
, O
can O
have O
any O
evil O
tendency O
; O
and O
I O
am O
so O
far O
from O
objecting O
to O
dancing O
myself O
that O
I O
shall O
hope O
to O
be O
honoured O
with O
the O
hands O
of O
all O
my O
fair O
cousins O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
evening O
, O
and O
I O
take O
this O
opportunity O
of O
soliciting O
yours O
, O
Miss O
Elizabeth O
, O
for O
the O
two O
first O
dances O
especially O
, O
-- O
a O
preference O
which O
I O
trust O
my O
cousin O
Jane O
will O
attribute O
to O
the O
right O
cause O
, O
and O
not O
to O
any O
disrespect O
for O
her O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
felt O
herself O
completely O
taken O
in O
. O
She O
had O
fully O
proposed O
being O
engaged O
by O
Wickham O
for O
those O
very O
dances O
: O
-- O
and O
to O
have O
Mr. O
Collins O
instead O
! O
her O
liveliness O
had O
been O
never O
worse O
timed O
. O
There O
was O
no O
help O
for O
it O
however O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
happiness O
and O
her O
own O
was O
per O
force O
delayed O
a O
little O
longer O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
proposal O
accepted O
with O
as O
good O
a O
grace O
as O
she O
could O
. O
She O
was O
not O
the O
better O
pleased O
with O
his O
gallantry O
, O
from O
the O
idea O
it O
suggested O
of O
something O
more. O
-- O
It O
now O
first O
struck O
her O
, O
that O
_she_ O
was O
selected O
from O
among O
her O
sisters O
as O
worthy O
of O
being O
the O
mistress O
of O
Hunsford O
Parsonage O
, O
and O
of O
assisting O
to O
form O
a O
quadrille O
table O
at O
Rosings O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
more O
eligible O
visitors O
. O
The O
idea O
soon O
reached O
to O
conviction O
, O
as O
she O
observed O
his O
increasing O
civilities O
toward O
herself O
, O
and O
heard O
his O
frequent O
attempt O
at O
a O
compliment O
on O
her O
wit O
and O
vivacity O
; O
and O
though O
more O
astonished O
than O
gratified O
herself O
, O
by O
this O
effect O
of O
her O
charms O
, O
it O
was O
not O
long O
before O
her O
mother O
gave O
her O
to O
understand O
that O
the O
probability O
of O
their O
marriage O
was O
exceedingly O
agreeable O
to O
_her_ O
. O
Elizabeth O
however O
did O
not O
chuse O
to O
take O
the O
hint O
, O
being O
well O
aware O
that O
a O
serious O
dispute O
must O
be O
the O
consequence O
of O
any O
reply O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
might O
never O
make O
the O
offer O
, O
and O
till O
he O
did O
, O
it O
was O
useless O
to O
quarrel O
about O
him O
. O
If O
there O
had O
not O
been O
a O
Netherfield O
ball O
to O
prepare O
for O
and O
talk O
of O
, O
the O
younger O
Miss O
Bennets O
would O
have O
been O
in O
a O
pitiable O
state O
at O
this O
time O
, O
for O
from O
the O
day O
of O
the O
invitation O
, O
to O
the O
day O
of O
the O
ball O
, O
there O
was O
such O
a O
succession O
of O
rain O
as O
prevented O
their O
walking O
to O
Meryton O
once O
. O
No O
aunt O
, O
no O
officers O
, O
no O
news O
could O
be O
sought O
after O
; O
-- O
the O
very O
shoe-roses O
for O
Netherfield O
were O
got O
by O
proxy O
. O
Even O
Elizabeth O
might O
have O
found O
some O
trial O
of O
her O
patience O
in O
weather O
, O
which O
totally O
suspended O
the O
improvement O
of O
her O
acquaintance O
with O
Mr. O
Wickham O
; O
and O
nothing O
less O
than O
a O
dance O
on O
Tuesday O
, O
could O
have O
made O
such O
a O
Friday O
, O
Saturday O
, O
Sunday O
and O
Monday O
, O
endurable O
to O
Kitty O
and O
Lydia O
. O
