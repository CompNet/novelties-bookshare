Mr. O
Collins O
's O
triumph O
in O
consequence O
of O
this O
invitation O
was O
complete O
. O
The O
power O
of O
displaying O
the O
grandeur O
of O
his O
patroness O
to O
his O
wondering O
visitors O
, O
and O
of O
letting O
them O
see O
her O
civility O
towards O
himself O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
was O
exactly O
what O
he O
had O
wished O
for O
; O
and O
that O
an O
opportunity O
of O
doing O
it O
should O
be O
given O
so O
soon O
, O
was O
such O
an O
instance O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
condescension O
as O
he O
knew O
not O
how O
to O
admire O
enough O
. O
" O
I O
confess O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
that O
I O
should O
not O
have O
been O
at O
all O
surprised O
by O
her O
Ladyship O
's O
asking O
us O
on O
Sunday O
to O
drink O
tea O
and O
spend O
the O
evening O
at O
Rosings O
. O
I O
rather O
expected O
, O
from O
my O
knowledge O
of O
her O
affability O
, O
that O
it O
would O
happen O
. O
But O
who O
could O
have O
foreseen O
such O
an O
attention O
as O
this O
? O
Who O
could O
have O
imagined O
that O
we O
should O
receive O
an O
invitation O
to O
dine O
there O
( O
an O
invitation O
moreover O
including O
the O
whole O
party O
) O
so O
immediately O
after O
your O
arrival O
! O
" O
" O
I O
am O
the O
less O
surprised O
at O
what O
has O
happened O
, O
" O
replied O
Sir O
William O
, O
" O
from O
that O
knowledge O
of O
what O
the O
manners O
of O
the O
great O
really O
are O
, O
which O
my O
situation O
in O
life O
has O
allowed O
me O
to O
acquire O
. O
About O
the O
Court O
, O
such O
instances O
of O
elegant O
breeding O
are O
not O
uncommon O
. O
" O
Scarcely O
any O
thing O
was O
talked O
of O
the O
whole O
day O
or O
next O
morning O
, O
but O
their O
visit O
to O
Rosings O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
carefully O
instructing O
them O
in O
what O
they O
were O
to O
expect O
, O
that O
the O
sight O
of O
such O
rooms O
, O
so O
many O
servants O
, O
and O
so O
splendid O
a O
dinner O
might O
not O
wholly O
overpower O
them O
. O
When O
the O
ladies O
were O
separating O
for O
the O
toilette O
, O
he O
said O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
Do O
not O
make O
yourself O
uneasy O
, O
my O
dear O
cousin O
, O
about O
your O
apparel O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
is O
far O
from O
requiring O
that O
elegance O
of O
dress O
in O
us O
, O
which O
becomes O
herself O
and O
daughter O
. O
I O
would O
advise O
you O
merely O
to O
put O
on O
whatever O
of O
your O
clothes O
is O
superior O
to O
the O
rest O
, O
there O
is O
no O
occasion O
for O
any O
thing O
more O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
will O
not O
think O
the O
worse O
of O
you O
for O
being O
simply O
dressed O
. O
She O
likes O
to O
have O
the O
distinction O
of O
rank O
preserved O
. O
" O
While O
they O
were O
dressing O
, O
he O
came O
two O
or O
three O
times O
to O
their O
different O
doors O
, O
to O
recommend O
their O
being O
quick O
, O
as O
Lady O
Catherine O
very O
much O
objected O
to O
be O
kept O
waiting O
for O
her O
dinner. O
-- O
Such O
formidable O
accounts O
of O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
and O
her O
manner O
of O
living O
, O
quite O
frightened O
Maria O
Lucas O
, O
who O
had O
been O
little O
used O
to O
company O
, O
and O
she O
looked O
forward O
to O
her O
introduction O
at O
Rosings O
, O
with O
as O
much O
apprehension O
, O
as O
her O
father O
had O
done O
to O
his O
presentation O
at O
St. O
James O
's O
. O
As O
the O
weather O
was O
fine O
, O
they O
had O
a O
pleasant O
walk O
of O
about O
half O
a O
mile O
across O
the O
park. O
-- O
Every O
park O
has O
its O
beauty O
and O
its O
prospects O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
saw O
much O
to O
be O
pleased O
with O
, O
though O
she O
could O
not O
be O
in O
such O
raptures O
as O
Mr. O
Collins O
expected O
the O
scene O
to O
inspire O
, O
and O
was O
but O
slightly O
affected O
by O
his O
enumeration O
of O
the O
windows O
in O
front O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
his O
relation O
of O
what O
the O
glazing O
altogether O
had O
originally O
cost O
Sir O
Lewis O
De O
Bourgh O
. O
When O
they O
ascended O
the O
steps O
to O
the O
hall O
, O
Maria O
's O
alarm O
was O
every O
moment O
increasing O
, O
and O
even O
Sir O
William O
did O
not O
look O
perfectly O
calm. O
-- O
Elizabeth O
's O
courage O
did O
not O
fail O
her O
. O
She O
had O
heard O
nothing O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
that O
spoke O
her O
awful O
from O
any O
extraordinary O
talents O
or O
miraculous O
virtue O
, O
and O
the O
mere O
stateliness O
of O
money O
and O
rank O
, O
she O
thought O
she O
could O
witness O
without O
trepidation O
. O
From O
the O
entrance O
hall O
, O
of O
which O
Mr. O
Collins O
pointed O
out O
, O
with O
a O
rapturous O
air O
, O
the O
fine O
proportion O
and O
finished O
ornaments O
, O
they O
followed O
the O
servants O
through O
an O
anti-chamber O
, O
to O
the O
room O
where O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
her O
daughter O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
were O
sitting. O
-- O
Her O
Ladyship O
, O
with O
great O
condescension O
, O
arose O
to O
receive O
them O
; O
and O
as O
Mrs. O
Collins O
had O
settled O
it O
with O
her O
husband O
that O
the O
office O
of O
introduction O
should O
be O
her O
's O
, O
it O
was O
performed O
in O
a O
proper O
manner O
, O
without O
any O
of O
those O
apologies O
and O
thanks O
which O
he O
would O
have O
thought O
necessary O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
having O
been O
at O
St. O
James O
's O
, O
Sir O
William O
was O
so O
completely O
awed O
, O
by O
the O
grandeur O
surrounding O
him O
, O
that O
he O
had O
but O
just O
courage O
enough O
to O
make O
a O
very O
low O
bow O
, O
and O
take O
his O
seat O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
; O
and O
his O
daughter O
, O
frightened O
almost O
out O
of O
her O
senses O
, O
sat O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
her O
chair O
, O
not O
knowing O
which O
way O
to O
look O
. O
Elizabeth O
found O
herself O
quite O
equal O
to O
the O
scene O
, O
and O
could O
observe O
the O
three O
ladies O
before O
her O
composedly. O
-- O
Lady O
Catherine O
was O
a O
tall O
, O
large O
woman O
, O
with O
strongly-marked O
features O
, O
which O
might O
once O
have O
been O
handsome O
. O
Her O
air O
was O
not O
conciliating O
, O
nor O
was O
her O
manner O
of O
receiving O
them O
, O
such O
as O
to O
make O
her O
visitors O
forget O
their O
inferior O
rank O
. O
She O
was O
not O
rendered O
formidable O
by O
silence O
; O
but O
whatever O
she O
said O
, O
was O
spoken O
in O
so O
authoritative O
a O
tone O
, O
as O
marked O
her O
self-importance O
, O
and O
brought O
Mr O
. O
Wickham O
immediately O
to O
Elizabeth O
's O
mind O
; O
and O
from O
the O
observation O
of O
the O
day O
altogether O
, O
she O
believed O
Lady O
Catherine O
to O
be O
exactly O
what O
he O
had O
represented O
. O
When O
, O
after O
examining O
the O
mother O
, O
in O
whose O
countenance O
and O
deportment O
she O
soon O
found O
some O
resemblance O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
she O
turned O
her O
eyes O
on O
the O
daughter O
, O
she O
could O
almost O
have O
joined O
in O
Maria O
's O
astonishment O
, O
at O
her O
being O
so O
thin O
, O
and O
so O
small O
. O
There O
was O
neither O
in O
figure O
nor O
face O
, O
any O
likeness O
between O
the O
ladies O
. O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
was O
pale O
and O
sickly O
; O
her O
features O
, O
though O
not O
plain O
, O
were O
insignificant O
; O
and O
she O
spoke O
very O
little O
, O
except O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
, O
to O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
, O
in O
whose O
appearance O
there O
was O
nothing O
remarkable O
, O
and O
who O
was O
entirely O
engaged O
in O
listening O
to O
what O
she O
said O
, O
and O
placing O
a O
screen O
in O
the O
proper O
direction O
before O
her O
eyes O
. O
After O
sitting O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
they O
were O
all O
sent O
to O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
, O
to O
admire O
the O
view O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
attending O
them O
to O
point O
out O
its O
beauties O
, O
and O
Lady O
Catherine O
kindly O
informing O
them O
that O
it O
was O
much O
better O
worth O
looking O
at O
in O
the O
summer O
. O
The O
dinner O
was O
exceedingly O
handsome O
, O
and O
there O
were O
all O
the O
servants O
, O
and O
all O
the O
articles O
of O
plate O
which O
Mr. O
Collins O
had O
promised O
; O
and O
, O
as O
he O
had O
likewise O
foretold O
, O
he O
took O
his O
seat O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
table O
, O
by O
her O
ladyship O
's O
desire O
, O
and O
looked O
as O
if O
he O
felt O
that O
life O
could O
furnish O
nothing O
greater. O
-- O
He O
carved O
, O
and O
ate O
, O
and O
praised O
with O
delighted O
alacrity O
; O
and O
every O
dish O
was O
commended O
, O
first O
by O
him O
, O
and O
then O
by O
Sir O
William O
, O
who O
was O
now O
enough O
recovered O
to O
echo O
whatever O
his O
son O
in O
law O
said O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
which O
Elizabeth O
wondered O
Lady O
Catherine O
could O
bear O
. O
But O
Lady O
Catherine O
seemed O
gratified O
by O
their O
excessive O
admiration O
, O
and O
gave O
most O
gracious O
smiles O
, O
especially O
when O
any O
dish O
on O
the O
table O
proved O
a O
novelty O
to O
them O
. O
The O
party O
did O
not O
supply O
much O
conversation O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
ready O
to O
speak O
whenever O
there O
was O
an O
opening O
, O
but O
she O
was O
seated O
between O
Charlotte O
and O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
-- O
the O
former O
of O
whom O
was O
engaged O
in O
listening O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
and O
the O
latter O
said O
not O
a O
word O
to O
her O
all O
dinner O
time O
. O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
was O
chiefly O
employed O
in O
watching O
how O
little O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
ate O
, O
pressing O
her O
to O
try O
some O
other O
dish O
, O
and O
fearing O
she O
were O
indisposed O
. O
Maria O
thought O
speaking O
out O
of O
the O
question O
, O
and O
the O
gentlemen O
did O
nothing O
but O
eat O
and O
admire O
. O
When O
the O
ladies O
returned O
to O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
there O
was O
little O
to O
be O
done O
but O
to O
hear O
Lady O
Catherine O
talk O
, O
which O
she O
did O
without O
any O
intermission O
till O
coffee O
came O
in O
, O
delivering O
her O
opinion O
on O
every O
subject O
in O
so O
decisive O
a O
manner O
as O
proved O
that O
she O
was O
not O
used O
to O
have O
her O
judgment O
controverted O
. O
She O
enquired O
into O
Charlotte O
's O
domestic O
concerns O
familiarly O
and O
minutely O
, O
and O
gave O
her O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
advice O
, O
as O
to O
the O
management O
of O
them O
all O
; O
told O
her O
how O
every O
thing O
ought O
to O
be O
regulated O
in O
so O
small O
a O
family O
as O
her O
's O
, O
and O
instructed O
her O
as O
to O
the O
care O
of O
her O
cows O
and O
her O
poultry O
. O
Elizabeth O
found O
that O
nothing O
was O
beneath O
this O
great O
Lady O
's O
attention O
, O
which O
could O
furnish O
her O
with O
an O
occasion O
of O
dictating O
to O
others O
. O
In O
the O
intervals O
of O
her O
discourse O
with O
Mrs. O
Collins O
, O
she O
addressed O
a O
variety O
of O
questions O
to O
Maria O
and O
Elizabeth O
, O
but O
especially O
to O
the O
latter O
, O
of O
whose O
connections O
she O
knew O
the O
least O
, O
and O
who O
she O
observed O
to O
Mrs. O
Collins O
, O
was O
a O
very O
genteel O
, O
pretty O
kind O
of O
girl O
. O
She O
asked O
her O
at O
different O
times O
, O
how O
many O
sisters O
she O
had O
, O
whether O
they O
were O
older O
or O
younger O
than O
herself O
, O
whether O
any O
of O
them O
were O
likely O
to O
be O
married O
, O
whether O
they O
were O
handsome O
, O
where O
they O
had O
been O
educated O
, O
what O
carriage O
her O
father O
kept O
, O
and O
what O
had O
been O
her O
mother O
's O
maiden O
name O
? O
-- O
Elizabeth O
felt O
all O
the O
impertinence O
of O
her O
questions O
, O
but O
answered O
them O
very O
composedly. O
-- O
Lady O
Catherine O
then O
observed O
, O
" O
Your O
father O
's O
estate O
is O
entailed O
on O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
I O
think O
. O
For O
your O
sake O
, O
" O
turning O
to O
Charlotte O
, O
" O
I O
am O
glad O
of O
it O
; O
but O
otherwise O
I O
see O
no O
occasion O
for O
entailing O
estates O
from O
the O
female O
line. O
-- O
It O
was O
not O
thought O
necessary O
in O
Sir O
Lewis O
de O
Bourgh O
's O
family. O
-- O
Do O
you O
play O
and O
sing O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
? O
" O
" O
A O
little O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
then O
-- O
some O
time O
or O
other O
we O
shall O
be O
happy O
to O
hear O
you O
. O
Our O
instrument O
is O
a O
capital O
one O
, O
probably O
superior O
to O
-- O
-- O
You O
shall O
try O
it O
some O
day. O
-- O
Do O
your O
sisters O
play O
and O
sing O
? O
" O
" O
One O
of O
them O
does O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
did O
not O
you O
all O
learn O
? O
-- O
You O
ought O
all O
to O
have O
learned O
. O
The O
Miss O
Webbs O
all O
play O
, O
and O
their O
father O
has O
not O
so O
good O
an O
income O
as O
your's. O
-- O
Do O
you O
draw O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
not O
at O
all O
. O
" O
" O
What O
, O
none O
of O
you O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
one O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
very O
strange O
. O
But O
I O
suppose O
you O
had O
no O
opportunity O
. O
Your O
mother O
should O
have O
taken O
you O
to O
town O
every O
spring O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
masters O
. O
" O
" O
My O
mother O
would O
have O
had O
no O
objection O
, O
but O
my O
father O
hates O
London O
. O
" O
" O
Has O
your O
governess O
left O
you O
? O
" O
" O
We O
never O
had O
any O
governess O
. O
" O
" O
No O
governess O
! O
How O
was O
that O
possible O
? O
Five O
daughters O
brought O
up O
at O
home O
without O
a O
governess O
! O
-- O
I O
never O
heard O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
. O
Your O
mother O
must O
have O
been O
quite O
a O
slave O
to O
your O
education O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
hardly O
help O
smiling O
, O
as O
she O
assured O
her O
that O
had O
not O
been O
the O
case O
. O
" O
Then O
, O
who O
taught O
you O
? O
who O
attended O
to O
you O
? O
Without O
a O
governess O
you O
must O
have O
been O
neglected O
. O
" O
" O
Compared O
with O
some O
families O
, O
I O
believe O
we O
were O
; O
but O
such O
of O
us O
as O
wished O
to O
learn O
, O
never O
wanted O
the O
means O
. O
We O
were O
always O
encouraged O
to O
read O
, O
and O
had O
all O
the O
masters O
that O
were O
necessary O
. O
Those O
who O
chose O
to O
be O
idle O
, O
certainly O
might O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
no O
doubt O
; O
but O
that O
is O
what O
a O
governess O
will O
prevent O
, O
and O
if O
I O
had O
known O
your O
mother O
, O
I O
should O
have O
advised O
her O
most O
strenuously O
to O
engage O
one O
. O
I O
always O
say O
that O
nothing O
is O
to O
be O
done O
in O
education O
without O
steady O
and O
regular O
instruction O
, O
and O
nobody O
but O
a O
governess O
can O
give O
it O
. O
It O
is O
wonderful O
how O
many O
families O
I O
have O
been O
the O
means O
of O
supplying O
in O
that O
way O
. O
I O
am O
always O
glad O
to O
get O
a O
young O
person O
well O
placed O
out O
. O
Four O
nieces O
of O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
are O
most O
delightfully O
situated O
through O
my O
means O
; O
and O
it O
was O
but O
the O
other O
day O
, O
that O
I O
recommended O
another O
young O
person O
, O
who O
was O
merely O
accidentally O
mentioned O
to O
me O
, O
and O
the O
family O
are O
quite O
delighted O
with O
her O
. O
Mrs. O
Collins O
, O
did O
I O
tell O
you O
of O
Lady O
Metcalfe O
's O
calling O
yesterday O
to O
thank O
me O
? O
She O
finds O
Miss O
Pope O
a O
treasure O
. O
'Lady O
Catherine O
, O
' O
said O
she O
, O
'you O
have O
given O
me O
a O
treasure O
. O
' O
Are O
any O
of O
your O
younger O
sisters O
out O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
Ma'am O
, O
all O
. O
" O
" O
All O
! O
-- O
What O
, O
all O
five O
out O
at O
once O
? O
Very O
odd O
! O
-- O
And O
you O
only O
the O
second. O
-- O
The O
younger O
ones O
out O
before O
the O
elder O
are O
married O
! O
-- O
Your O
younger O
sisters O
must O
be O
very O
young O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
my O
youngest O
is O
not O
sixteen O
. O
Perhaps O
_she_ O
is O
full O
young O
to O
be O
much O
in O
company O
. O
But O
really O
, O
Ma'am O
, O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
hard O
upon O
younger O
sisters O
, O
that O
they O
should O
not O
have O
their O
share O
of O
society O
and O
amusement O
because O
the O
elder O
may O
not O
have O
the O
means O
or O
inclination O
to O
marry O
early. O
-- O
The O
last O
born O
has O
as O
good O
a O
right O
to O
the O
pleasures O
of O
youth O
, O
as O
the O
first O
. O
And O
to O
be O
kept O
back O
on O
_such_ O
a O
motive O
! O
-- O
I O
think O
it O
would O
not O
be O
very O
likely O
to O
promote O
sisterly O
affection O
or O
delicacy O
of O
mind O
. O
" O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
, O
" O
said O
her O
Ladyship O
, O
" O
you O
give O
your O
opinion O
very O
decidedly O
for O
so O
young O
a O
person. O
-- O
Pray O
, O
what O
is O
your O
age O
? O
" O
" O
With O
three O
younger O
sisters O
grown O
up O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
smiling O
, O
" O
your O
Ladyship O
can O
hardly O
expect O
me O
to O
own O
it O
. O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
seemed O
quite O
astonished O
at O
not O
receiving O
a O
direct O
answer O
; O
and O
Elizabeth O
suspected O
herself O
to O
be O
the O
first O
creature O
who O
had O
ever O
dared O
to O
trifle O
with O
so O
much O
dignified O
impertinence O
. O
" O
You O
can O
not O
be O
more O
than O
twenty O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
-- O
therefore O
you O
need O
not O
conceal O
your O
age O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
one O
and O
twenty O
. O
" O
When O
the O
gentlemen O
had O
joined O
them O
, O
and O
tea O
was O
over O
, O
the O
card O
tables O
were O
placed O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
, O
Sir O
William O
, O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Collins O
sat O
down O
to O
quadrille O
; O
and O
as O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
chose O
to O
play O
at O
cassino O
, O
the O
two O
girls O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
assisting O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
to O
make O
up O
her O
party O
. O
Their O
table O
was O
superlatively O
stupid O
. O
Scarcely O
a O
syllable O
was O
uttered O
that O
did O
not O
relate O
to O
the O
game O
, O
except O
when O
Mrs. O
Jenkinson O
expressed O
her O
fears O
of O
Miss O
De O
Bourgh O
's O
being O
too O
hot O
or O
too O
cold O
, O
or O
having O
too O
much O
or O
too O
little O
light O
. O
A O
great O
deal O
more O
passed O
at O
the O
other O
table O
. O
Lady O
Catherine O
was O
generally O
speaking O
-- O
stating O
the O
mistakes O
of O
the O
three O
others O
, O
or O
relating O
some O
anecdote O
of O
herself O
. O
Mr. O
Collins O
was O
employed O
in O
agreeing O
to O
every O
thing O
her O
Ladyship O
said O
, O
thanking O
her O
for O
every O
fish O
he O
won O
, O
and O
apologising O
if O
he O
thought O
he O
won O
too O
many O
. O
Sir O
William O
did O
not O
say O
much O
. O
He O
was O
storing O
his O
memory O
with O
anecdotes O
and O
noble O
names O
. O
When O
Lady O
Catherine O
and O
her O
daughter O
had O
played O
as O
long O
as O
they O
chose O
, O
the O
tables O
were O
broke O
up O
, O
the O
carriage O
was O
offered O
to O
Mrs. O
Collins O
, O
gratefully O
accepted O
, O
and O
immediately O
ordered O
. O
The O
party O
then O
gathered O
round O
the O
fire O
to O
hear O
Lady O
Catherine O
determine O
what O
weather O
they O
were O
to O
have O
on O
the O
morrow O
. O
From O
these O
instructions O
they O
were O
summoned O
by O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
coach O
, O
and O
with O
many O
speeches O
of O
thankfulness O
on O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
's O
side O
, O
and O
as O
many O
bows O
on O
Sir O
William O
's O
, O
they O
departed O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
they O
had O
driven O
from O
the O
door O
, O
Elizabeth O
was O
called O
on O
by O
her O
cousin O
, O
to O
give O
her O
opinion O
of O
all O
that O
she O
had O
seen O
at O
Rosings O
, O
which O
, O
for O
Charlotte O
's O
sake O
, O
she O
made O
more O
favourable O
than O
it O
really O
was O
. O
But O
her O
commendation O
, O
though O
costing O
her O
some O
trouble O
, O
could O
by O
no O
means O
satisfy O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
and O
he O
was O
very O
soon O
obliged O
to O
take O
her O
Ladyship O
's O
praise O
into O
his O
own O
hands O
. O
