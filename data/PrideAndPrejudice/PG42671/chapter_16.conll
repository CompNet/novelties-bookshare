As O
no O
objection O
was O
made O
to O
the O
young O
people O
's O
engagement O
with O
their O
aunt O
, O
and O
all O
Mr. O
Collins O
's O
scruples O
of O
leaving O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
for O
a O
single O
evening O
during O
his O
visit O
were O
most O
steadily O
resisted O
, O
the O
coach O
conveyed O
him O
and O
his O
five O
cousins O
at O
a O
suitable O
hour O
to O
Meryton O
; O
and O
the O
girls O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
hearing O
, O
as O
they O
entered O
the O
drawing-room O
, O
that O
Mr. O
Wickham O
had O
accepted O
their O
uncle O
's O
invitation O
, O
and O
was O
then O
in O
the O
house O
. O
When O
this O
information O
was O
given O
, O
and O
they O
had O
all O
taken O
their O
seats O
, O
Mr O
. O
Collins O
was O
at O
leisure O
to O
look O
around O
him O
and O
admire O
, O
and O
he O
was O
so O
much O
struck O
with O
the O
size O
and O
furniture O
of O
the O
apartment O
, O
that O
he O
declared O
he O
might O
almost O
have O
supposed O
himself O
in O
the O
small O
summer O
breakfast O
parlour O
at O
Rosings O
; O
a O
comparison O
that O
did O
not O
at O
first O
convey O
much O
gratification O
; O
but O
when O
Mrs. O
Philips O
understood O
from O
him O
what O
Rosings O
was O
, O
and O
who O
was O
its O
proprietor O
, O
when O
she O
had O
listened O
to O
the O
description O
of O
only O
one O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
's O
drawing-rooms O
, O
and O
found O
that O
the O
chimney-piece O
alone O
had O
cost O
eight O
hundred O
pounds O
, O
she O
felt O
all O
the O
force O
of O
the O
compliment O
, O
and O
would O
hardly O
have O
resented O
a O
comparison O
with O
the O
housekeeper O
's O
room O
. O
In O
describing O
to O
her O
all O
the O
grandeur O
of O
Lady O
Catherine O
and O
her O
mansion O
, O
with O
occasional O
digressions O
in O
praise O
of O
his O
own O
humble O
abode O
, O
and O
the O
improvements O
it O
was O
receiving O
, O
he O
was O
happily O
employed O
until O
the O
gentlemen O
joined O
them O
; O
and O
he O
found O
in O
Mrs. O
Philips O
a O
very O
attentive O
listener O
, O
whose O
opinion O
of O
his O
consequence O
increased O
with O
what O
she O
heard O
, O
and O
who O
was O
resolving O
to O
retail O
it O
all O
among O
her O
neighbours O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
could O
. O
To O
the O
girls O
, O
who O
could O
not O
listen O
to O
their O
cousin O
, O
and O
who O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
but O
to O
wish O
for O
an O
instrument O
, O
and O
examine O
their O
own O
indifferent O
imitations O
of O
china O
on O
the O
mantle-piece O
, O
the O
interval O
of O
waiting O
appeared O
very O
long O
. O
It O
was O
over O
at O
last O
however O
. O
The O
gentlemen O
did O
approach O
; O
and O
when O
Mr. O
Wickham O
walked O
into O
the O
room O
, O
Elizabeth O
felt O
that O
she O
had O
neither O
been O
seeing O
him O
before O
, O
nor O
thinking O
of O
him O
since O
, O
with O
the O
smallest O
degree O
of O
unreasonable O
admiration O
. O
The O
officers O
of O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
were O
in O
general O
a O
very O
creditable O
, O
gentleman-like O
set O
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
them O
were O
of O
the O
present O
party O
; O
but O
Mr. O
Wickham O
was O
as O
far O
beyond O
them O
all O
in O
person O
, O
countenance O
, O
air O
, O
and O
walk O
, O
as O
_they_ O
were O
superior O
to O
the O
broad-faced O
stuffy O
uncle O
Philips O
, O
breathing O
port O
wine O
, O
who O
followed O
them O
into O
the O
room O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
was O
the O
happy O
man O
towards O
whom O
almost O
every O
female O
eye O
was O
turned O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
was O
the O
happy O
woman O
by O
whom O
he O
finally O
seated O
himself O
; O
and O
the O
agreeable O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
immediately O
fell O
into O
conversation O
, O
though O
it O
was O
only O
on O
its O
being O
a O
wet O
night O
, O
and O
on O
the O
probability O
of O
a O
rainy O
season O
, O
made O
her O
feel O
that O
the O
commonest O
, O
dullest O
, O
most O
thread-bare O
topic O
might O
be O
rendered O
interesting O
by O
the O
skill O
of O
the O
speaker O
. O
With O
such O
rivals O
for O
the O
notice O
of O
the O
fair O
, O
as O
Mr. O
Wickham O
and O
the O
officers O
, O
Mr. O
Collins O
seemed O
likely O
to O
sink O
into O
insignificance O
; O
to O
the O
young O
ladies O
he O
certainly O
was O
nothing O
; O
but O
he O
had O
still O
at O
intervals O
a O
kind O
listener O
in O
Mrs. O
Philips O
, O
and O
was O
, O
by O
her O
watchfulness O
, O
most O
abundantly O
supplied O
with O
coffee O
and O
muffin O
. O
When O
the O
card O
tables O
were O
placed O
, O
he O
had O
an O
opportunity O
of O
obliging O
her O
in O
return O
, O
by O
sitting O
down O
to O
whist O
. O
" O
I O
know O
little O
of O
the O
game O
, O
at O
present O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
but O
I O
shall O
be O
glad O
to O
improve O
myself O
, O
for O
in O
my O
situation O
of O
life O
-- O
-- O
" O
Mrs. O
Philips O
was O
very O
thankful O
for O
his O
compliance O
, O
but O
could O
not O
wait O
for O
his O
reason O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
did O
not O
play O
at O
whist O
, O
and O
with O
ready O
delight O
was O
he O
received O
at O
the O
other O
table O
between O
Elizabeth O
and O
Lydia O
. O
At O
first O
there O
seemed O
danger O
of O
Lydia O
's O
engrossing O
him O
entirely O
, O
for O
she O
was O
a O
most O
determined O
talker O
; O
but O
being O
likewise O
extremely O
fond O
of O
lottery O
tickets O
, O
she O
soon O
grew O
too O
much O
interested O
in O
the O
game O
, O
too O
eager O
in O
making O
bets O
and O
exclaiming O
after O
prizes O
, O
to O
have O
attention O
for O
any O
one O
in O
particular O
. O
Allowing O
for O
the O
common O
demands O
of O
the O
game O
, O
Mr. O
Wickham O
was O
therefore O
at O
leisure O
to O
talk O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
she O
was O
very O
willing O
to O
hear O
him O
, O
though O
what O
she O
chiefly O
wished O
to O
hear O
she O
could O
not O
hope O
to O
be O
told O
, O
the O
history O
of O
his O
acquaintance O
with O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
She O
dared O
not O
even O
mention O
that O
gentleman O
. O
Her O
curiosity O
however O
was O
unexpectedly O
relieved O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
began O
the O
subject O
himself O
. O
He O
inquired O
how O
far O
Netherfield O
was O
from O
Meryton O
; O
and O
, O
after O
receiving O
her O
answer O
, O
asked O
in O
an O
hesitating O
manner O
how O
long O
Mr. O
Darcy O
had O
been O
staying O
there O
. O
" O
About O
a O
month O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
and O
then O
, O
unwilling O
to O
let O
the O
subject O
drop O
, O
added O
, O
" O
He O
is O
a O
man O
of O
very O
large O
property O
in O
Derbyshire O
, O
I O
understand O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
replied O
Wickham O
; O
-- O
" O
his O
estate O
there O
is O
a O
noble O
one O
. O
A O
clear O
ten O
thousand O
per O
annum O
. O
You O
could O
not O
have O
met O
with O
a O
person O
more O
capable O
of O
giving O
you O
certain O
information O
on O
that O
head O
than O
myself O
-- O
for O
I O
have O
been O
connected O
with O
his O
family O
in O
a O
particular O
manner O
from O
my O
infancy O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
but O
look O
surprised O
. O
" O
You O
may O
well O
be O
surprised O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
at O
such O
an O
assertion O
, O
after O
seeing O
, O
as O
you O
probably O
might O
, O
the O
very O
cold O
manner O
of O
our O
meeting O
yesterday. O
-- O
Are O
you O
much O
acquainted O
with O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
? O
" O
" O
As O
much O
as O
I O
ever O
wish O
to O
be O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
warmly O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
have O
spent O
four O
days O
in O
the O
same O
house O
with O
him O
, O
and O
I O
think O
him O
very O
disagreeable O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
no O
right O
to O
give O
_my_ O
opinion O
, O
" O
said O
Wickham O
, O
" O
as O
to O
his O
being O
agreeable O
or O
otherwise O
. O
I O
am O
not O
qualified O
to O
form O
one O
. O
I O
have O
known O
him O
too O
long O
and O
too O
well O
to O
be O
a O
fair O
judge O
. O
It O
is O
impossible O
for O
_me_ O
to O
be O
impartial O
. O
But O
I O
believe O
your O
opinion O
of O
him O
would O
in O
general O
astonish O
-- O
and O
perhaps O
you O
would O
not O
express O
it O
quite O
so O
strongly O
anywhere O
else. O
-- O
Here O
you O
are O
in O
your O
own O
family O
. O
" O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
I O
say O
no O
more O
_here_ O
than O
I O
might O
say O
in O
any O
house O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
except O
Netherfield O
. O
He O
is O
not O
at O
all O
liked O
in O
Hertfordshire O
. O
Every O
body O
is O
disgusted O
with O
his O
pride O
. O
You O
will O
not O
find O
him O
more O
favourably O
spoken O
of O
by O
any O
one O
. O
" O
" O
I O
can O
not O
pretend O
to O
be O
sorry O
, O
" O
said O
Wickham O
, O
after O
a O
short O
interruption O
, O
" O
that O
he O
or O
that O
any O
man O
should O
not O
be O
estimated O
beyond O
their O
deserts O
; O
but O
with O
_him_ O
I O
believe O
it O
does O
not O
often O
happen O
. O
The O
world O
is O
blinded O
by O
his O
fortune O
and O
consequence O
, O
or O
frightened O
by O
his O
high O
and O
imposing O
manners O
, O
and O
sees O
him O
only O
as O
he O
chuses O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
" O
" O
I O
should O
take O
him O
, O
even O
on O
_my_ O
slight O
acquaintance O
, O
to O
be O
an O
ill-tempered O
man O
. O
" O
Wickham O
only O
shook O
his O
head O
. O
" O
I O
wonder O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
at O
the O
next O
opportunity O
of O
speaking O
, O
" O
whether O
he O
is O
likely O
to O
be O
in O
this O
country O
much O
longer O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
at O
all O
know O
; O
but O
I O
_heard_ O
nothing O
of O
his O
going O
away O
when O
I O
was O
at O
Netherfield O
. O
I O
hope O
your O
plans O
in O
favour O
of O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
will O
not O
be O
affected O
by O
his O
being O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
no O
-- O
it O
is O
not O
for O
_me_ O
to O
be O
driven O
away O
by O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
If O
_he_ O
wishes O
to O
avoid O
seeing O
_me_ O
, O
he O
must O
go O
. O
We O
are O
not O
on O
friendly O
terms O
, O
and O
it O
always O
gives O
me O
pain O
to O
meet O
him O
, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
reason O
for O
avoiding O
_him_ O
but O
what O
I O
might O
proclaim O
to O
all O
the O
world O
; O
a O
sense O
of O
very O
great O
ill O
usage O
, O
and O
most O
painful O
regrets O
at O
his O
being O
what O
he O
is O
. O
His O
father O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
best O
men O
that O
ever O
breathed O
, O
and O
the O
truest O
friend O
I O
ever O
had O
; O
and O
I O
can O
never O
be O
in O
company O
with O
this O
Mr. O
Darcy O
without O
being O
grieved O
to O
the O
soul O
by O
a O
thousand O
tender O
recollections O
. O
His O
behaviour O
to O
myself O
has O
been O
scandalous O
; O
but O
I O
verily O
believe O
I O
could O
forgive O
him O
any O
thing O
and O
every O
thing O
, O
rather O
than O
his O
disappointing O
the O
hopes O
and O
disgracing O
the O
memory O
of O
his O
father O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
found O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
subject O
increase O
, O
and O
listened O
with O
all O
her O
heart O
; O
but O
the O
delicacy O
of O
it O
prevented O
farther O
inquiry O
. O
Mr. O
Wickham O
began O
to O
speak O
on O
more O
general O
topics O
, O
Meryton O
, O
the O
neighbourhood O
, O
the O
society O
, O
appearing O
highly O
pleased O
with O
all O
that O
he O
had O
yet O
seen O
, O
and O
speaking O
of O
the O
latter O
especially O
, O
with O
gentle O
but O
very O
intelligible O
gallantry O
. O
" O
It O
was O
the O
prospect O
of O
constant O
society O
, O
and O
good O
society O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
" O
which O
was O
my O
chief O
inducement O
to O
enter O
the O
-- O
-- O
shire O
. O
I O
knew O
it O
to O
be O
a O
most O
respectable O
, O
agreeable O
corps O
, O
and O
my O
friend O
Denny O
tempted O
me O
farther O
by O
his O
account O
of O
their O
present O
quarters O
, O
and O
the O
very O
great O
attentions O
and O
excellent O
acquaintance O
Meryton O
had O
procured O
them O
. O
Society O
, O
I O
own O
, O
is O
necessary O
to O
me O
. O
I O
have O
been O
a O
disappointed O
man O
, O
and O
my O
spirits O
will O
not O
bear O
solitude O
. O
I O
_must_ O
have O
employment O
and O
society O
. O
A O
military O
life O
is O
not O
what O
I O
was O
intended O
for O
, O
but O
circumstances O
have O
now O
made O
it O
eligible O
. O
The O
church O
_ought_ O
to O
have O
been O
my O
profession O
-- O
I O
was O
brought O
up O
for O
the O
church O
, O
and O
I O
should O
at O
this O
time O
have O
been O
in O
possession O
of O
a O
most O
valuable O
living O
, O
had O
it O
pleased O
the O
gentleman O
we O
were O
speaking O
of O
just O
now O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
! O
" O
" O
Yes O
-- O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Darcy O
bequeathed O
me O
the O
next O
presentation O
of O
the O
best O
living O
in O
his O
gift O
. O
He O
was O
my O
godfather O
, O
and O
excessively O
attached O
to O
me O
. O
I O
can O
not O
do O
justice O
to O
his O
kindness O
. O
He O
meant O
to O
provide O
for O
me O
amply O
, O
and O
thought O
he O
had O
done O
it O
; O
but O
when O
the O
living O
fell O
, O
it O
was O
given O
elsewhere O
. O
" O
" O
Good O
heavens O
! O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
but O
how O
could O
_that_ O
be O
? O
-- O
How O
could O
his O
will O
be O
disregarded O
? O
-- O
Why O
did O
not O
you O
seek O
legal O
redress O
? O
" O
" O
There O
was O
just O
such O
an O
informality O
in O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
bequest O
as O
to O
give O
me O
no O
hope O
from O
law O
. O
A O
man O
of O
honour O
could O
not O
have O
doubted O
the O
intention O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Darcy O
chose O
to O
doubt O
it O
-- O
or O
to O
treat O
it O
as O
a O
merely O
conditional O
recommendation O
, O
and O
to O
assert O
that O
I O
had O
forfeited O
all O
claim O
to O
it O
by O
extravagance O
, O
imprudence O
, O
in O
short O
any O
thing O
or O
nothing O
. O
Certain O
it O
is O
, O
that O
the O
living O
became O
vacant O
two O
years O
ago O
, O
exactly O
as O
I O
was O
of O
an O
age O
to O
hold O
it O
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
given O
to O
another O
man O
; O
and O
no O
less O
certain O
is O
it O
, O
that O
I O
can O
not O
accuse O
myself O
of O
having O
really O
done O
any O
thing O
to O
deserve O
to O
lose O
it O
. O
I O
have O
a O
warm O
, O
unguarded O
temper O
, O
and O
I O
may O
perhaps O
have O
sometimes O
spoken O
my O
opinion O
_of_ O
him O
, O
and O
_to_ O
him O
, O
too O
freely O
. O
I O
can O
recal O
nothing O
worse O
. O
But O
the O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
we O
are O
very O
different O
sort O
of O
men O
, O
and O
that O
he O
hates O
me O
. O
" O
" O
This O
is O
quite O
shocking O
! O
-- O
He O
deserves O
to O
be O
publicly O
disgraced O
. O
" O
" O
Some O
time O
or O
other O
he O
_will_ O
be O
-- O
but O
it O
shall O
not O
be O
by O
_me_ O
. O
Till O
I O
can O
forget O
his O
father O
, O
I O
can O
never O
defy O
or O
expose O
_him_ O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
honoured O
him O
for O
such O
feelings O
, O
and O
thought O
him O
handsomer O
than O
ever O
as O
he O
expressed O
them O
. O
" O
But O
what O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
after O
a O
pause O
, O
" O
can O
have O
been O
his O
motive O
? O
-- O
what O
can O
have O
induced O
him O
to O
behave O
so O
cruelly O
? O
" O
" O
A O
thorough O
, O
determined O
dislike O
of O
me O
-- O
a O
dislike O
which O
I O
can O
not O
but O
attribute O
in O
some O
measure O
to O
jealousy O
. O
Had O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Darcy O
liked O
me O
less O
, O
his O
son O
might O
have O
borne O
with O
me O
better O
; O
but O
his O
father O
's O
uncommon O
attachment O
to O
me O
, O
irritated O
him O
I O
believe O
very O
early O
in O
life O
. O
He O
had O
not O
a O
temper O
to O
bear O
the O
sort O
of O
competition O
in O
which O
we O
stood O
-- O
the O
sort O
of O
preference O
which O
was O
often O
given O
me O
. O
" O
" O
I O
had O
not O
thought O
Mr. O
Darcy O
so O
bad O
as O
this O
-- O
though O
I O
have O
never O
liked O
him O
, O
I O
had O
not O
thought O
so O
very O
ill O
of O
him O
-- O
I O
had O
supposed O
him O
to O
be O
despising O
his O
fellow-creatures O
in O
general O
, O
but O
did O
not O
suspect O
him O
of O
descending O
to O
such O
malicious O
revenge O
, O
such O
injustice O
, O
such O
inhumanity O
as O
this O
! O
" O
After O
a O
few O
minutes O
reflection O
, O
however O
, O
she O
continued O
, O
" O
I O
_do_ O
remember O
his O
boasting O
one O
day O
, O
at O
Netherfield O
, O
of O
the O
implacability O
of O
his O
resentments O
, O
of O
his O
having O
an O
unforgiving O
temper O
. O
His O
disposition O
must O
be O
dreadful O
. O
" O
" O
I O
will O
not O
trust O
myself O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
" O
replied O
Wickham O
, O
" O
_I_ O
can O
hardly O
be O
just O
to O
him O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
was O
again O
deep O
in O
thought O
, O
and O
after O
a O
time O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
To O
treat O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
, O
the O
god-son O
, O
the O
friend O
, O
the O
favourite O
of O
his O
father O
! O
" O
-- O
She O
could O
have O
added O
, O
" O
A O
young O
man O
too O
, O
like O
_you_ O
, O
whose O
very O
countenance O
may O
vouch O
for O
your O
being O
amiable O
" O
-- O
but O
she O
contented O
herself O
with O
" O
And O
one O
, O
too O
, O
who O
had O
probably O
been O
his O
own O
companion O
from O
childhood O
, O
connected O
together O
, O
as O
I O
think O
you O
said O
, O
in O
the O
closest O
manner O
! O
" O
" O
We O
were O
born O
in O
the O
same O
parish O
, O
within O
the O
same O
park O
, O
the O
greatest O
part O
of O
our O
youth O
was O
passed O
together O
; O
inmates O
of O
the O
same O
house O
, O
sharing O
the O
same O
amusements O
, O
objects O
of O
the O
same O
parental O
care O
. O
_My_ O
father O
began O
life O
in O
the O
profession O
which O
your O
uncle O
, O
Mr. O
Philips O
, O
appears O
to O
do O
so O
much O
credit O
to O
-- O
but O
he O
gave O
up O
every O
thing O
to O
be O
of O
use O
to O
the O
late O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
and O
devoted O
all O
his O
time O
to O
the O
care O
of O
the O
Pemberley O
property O
. O
He O
was O
most O
highly O
esteemed O
by O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
a O
most O
intimate O
, O
confidential O
friend O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
often O
acknowledged O
himself O
to O
be O
under O
the O
greatest O
obligations O
to O
my O
father O
's O
active O
superintendance O
, O
and O
when O
immediately O
before O
my O
father O
's O
death O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
gave O
him O
a O
voluntary O
promise O
of O
providing O
for O
me O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
he O
felt O
it O
to O
be O
as O
much O
a O
debt O
of O
gratitude O
to O
_him_ O
, O
as O
of O
affection O
to O
myself O
. O
" O
" O
How O
strange O
! O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
How O
abominable O
! O
-- O
I O
wonder O
that O
the O
very O
pride O
of O
this O
Mr. O
Darcy O
has O
not O
made O
him O
just O
to O
you O
! O
-- O
If O
from O
no O
better O
motive O
, O
that O
he O
should O
not O
have O
been O
too O
proud O
to O
be O
dishonest O
, O
-- O
for O
dishonesty O
I O
must O
call O
it O
. O
" O
" O
It O
_is_ O
wonderful O
, O
" O
-- O
replied O
Wickham O
, O
-- O
" O
for O
almost O
all O
his O
actions O
may O
be O
traced O
to O
pride O
; O
-- O
and O
pride O
has O
often O
been O
his O
best O
friend O
. O
It O
has O
connected O
him O
nearer O
with O
virtue O
than O
any O
other O
feeling O
. O
But O
we O
are O
none O
of O
us O
consistent O
; O
and O
in O
his O
behaviour O
to O
me O
, O
there O
were O
stronger O
impulses O
even O
than O
pride O
. O
" O
" O
Can O
such O
abominable O
pride O
as O
his O
, O
have O
ever O
done O
him O
good O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
. O
It O
has O
often O
led O
him O
to O
be O
liberal O
and O
generous O
, O
-- O
to O
give O
his O
money O
freely O
, O
to O
display O
hospitality O
, O
to O
assist O
his O
tenants O
, O
and O
relieve O
the O
poor O
. O
Family O
pride O
, O
and O
_filial_ O
pride O
, O
for O
he O
is O
very O
proud O
of O
what O
his O
father O
was O
, O
have O
done O
this O
. O
Not O
to O
appear O
to O
disgrace O
his O
family O
, O
to O
degenerate O
from O
the O
popular O
qualities O
, O
or O
lose O
the O
influence O
of O
the O
Pemberley O
House O
, O
is O
a O
powerful O
motive O
. O
He O
has O
also O
_brotherly_ O
pride O
, O
which O
with O
_some_ O
brotherly O
affection O
, O
makes O
him O
a O
very O
kind O
and O
careful O
guardian O
of O
his O
sister O
; O
and O
you O
will O
hear O
him O
generally O
cried O
up O
as O
the O
most O
attentive O
and O
best O
of O
brothers O
. O
" O
" O
What O
sort O
of O
a O
girl O
is O
Miss O
Darcy O
? O
" O
He O
shook O
his O
head. O
-- O
" O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
call O
her O
amiable O
. O
It O
gives O
me O
pain O
to O
speak O
ill O
of O
a O
Darcy O
. O
But O
she O
is O
too O
much O
like O
her O
brother O
, O
-- O
very O
, O
very O
proud. O
-- O
As O
a O
child O
, O
she O
was O
affectionate O
and O
pleasing O
, O
and O
extremely O
fond O
of O
me O
; O
and O
I O
have O
devoted O
hours O
and O
hours O
to O
her O
amusement O
. O
But O
she O
is O
nothing O
to O
me O
now O
. O
She O
is O
a O
handsome O
girl O
, O
about O
fifteen O
or O
sixteen O
, O
and O
I O
understand O
highly O
accomplished O
. O
Since O
her O
father O
's O
death O
, O
her O
home O
has O
been O
London O
, O
where O
a O
lady O
lives O
with O
her O
, O
and O
superintends O
her O
education O
. O
" O
After O
many O
pauses O
and O
many O
trials O
of O
other O
subjects O
, O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
help O
reverting O
once O
more O
to O
the O
first O
, O
and O
saying O
, O
" O
I O
am O
astonished O
at O
his O
intimacy O
with O
Mr. O
Bingley O
! O
How O
can O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
who O
seems O
good O
humour O
itself O
, O

is O
, O
I O
really O
believe O

truly O
amiable O

in O
friendship O
with O
such O
a O
man O

How O
can O
they O
suit O

? O

Do O
you O
know O
Mr O

Bingley O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
at O
all O

is O
a O
sweet O
tempered O
, O
amiable O
, O
charming O
man O

can O
not O
know O
what O
Mr O

Darcy O
is O
. O
" O
" O
Probably O
not O
; O
-- O
but O
Mr. O
Darcy O
can O
please O
where O
he O
chuses O
. O
He O
does O
not O
want O
abilities O
. O
He O
can O
be O
a O
conversible O
companion O
if O
he O
thinks O
it O
worth O
his O
while O
. O
Among O
those O
who O
are O
at O
all O
his O
equals O
in O
consequence O
, O
he O
is O
a O
very O
different O
man O
from O
what O
he O
is O
to O
the O
less O
prosperous O
. O
His O
pride O
never O
deserts O
him O
; O
but O
with O
the O
rich O
, O
he O
is O
liberal-minded O
, O
just O
, O
sincere O
, O
rational O
, O
honourable O
, O
and O
perhaps O
agreeable O
, O
-- O
allowing O
something O
for O
fortune O
and O
figure O
. O
" O
The O
whist O
party O
soon O
afterwards O
breaking O
up O
, O
the O
players O
gathered O
round O
the O
other O
table O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Collins O
took O
his O
station O
between O
his O
cousin O
Elizabeth O
and O
Mrs O
. O
Philips. O
-- O
The O
usual O
inquiries O
as O
to O
his O
success O
were O
made O
by O
the O
latter O
. O
It O
had O
not O
been O
very O
great O
; O
he O
had O
lost O
every O
point O
; O
but O
when O
Mrs. O
Philips O
began O
to O
express O
her O
concern O
thereupon O
, O
he O
assured O
her O
with O
much O
earnest O
gravity O
that O
it O
was O
not O
of O
the O
least O
importance O
, O
that O
he O
considered O
the O
money O
as O
a O
mere O
trifle O
, O
and O
begged O
she O
would O
not O
make O
herself O
uneasy O
. O
" O
I O
know O
very O
well O
, O
madam O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
that O
when O
persons O
sit O
down O
to O
a O
card O
table O
, O
they O
must O
take O
their O
chance O
of O
these O
things O
, O
-- O
and O
happily O
I O
am O
not O
in O
such O
circumstances O
as O
to O
make O
five O
shillings O
any O
object O
. O
There O
are O
undoubtedly O
many O
who O
could O
not O
say O
the O
same O
, O
but O
thanks O
to O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
I O
am O
removed O
far O
beyond O
the O
necessity O
of O
regarding O
little O
matters O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Wickham O
's O
attention O
was O
caught O
; O
and O
after O
observing O
Mr. O
Collins O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
, O
he O
asked O
Elizabeth O
in O
a O
low O
voice O
whether O
her O
relation O
were O
very O
intimately O
acquainted O
with O
the O
family O
of O
de O
Bourgh O
. O
" O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O
, O
" O
she O
replied O
, O
" O
has O
very O
lately O
given O
him O
a O
living O
. O
I O
hardly O
know O
how O
Mr. O

was O
first O
introduced O
to O
her O
notice O

he O
certainly O
has O
not O
known O

" O
" O
You O
know O
of O
course O
that O
Lady O
Catherine O
de O
Bourgh O

that O

present O
Mr O

" O
" O
No O

indeed O

I O
did O
not. O

I O
knew O
nothing O

all O
of O

never O
heard O

daughter O

will O
have O
a O

is O
believed O
that O

unite O
the O
two O
estates O

" O
This O
information O
made O
Elizabeth O
smile O

as O
she O
thought O
of O
poor O
Miss O
Bingley O
. O
Vain O
indeed O
must O
be O
all O
her O
attentions O
, O
vain O
and O
useless O
her O
affection O
for O
his O
sister O
and O
her O
praise O
of O
himself O
, O
if O
he O
were O
already O
self-destined O
to O
another O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Collins O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
speaks O
highly O
both O
of O
Lady O

daughter O

but O
from O
some O
particulars O
that O
he O
has O
related O
of O
her O
ladyship O
, O
I O
suspect O
his O
gratitude O
misleads O
him O
, O
and O
that O
in O
spite O
of O
her O
being O
his O
patroness O
, O
she O
is O
an O
arrogant O

conceited O
woman O

" O
" O
I O
believe O
her O
to O
be O
both O
in O
a O
great O
degree O
, O
" O
replied O
Wickham O
; O
" O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
her O
for O
many O
years O
, O
but O
I O
very O
well O
remember O
that O
I O
never O
liked O
her O
, O
and O
that O
her O
manners O
were O
dictatorial O
and O
insolent O
. O
She O
has O
the O
reputation O
of O
being O
remarkably O
sensible O
and O
clever O
; O
but O
I O
rather O
believe O
she O
derives O
part O
of O
her O
abilities O
from O
her O
rank O
and O
fortune O
, O
part O
from O
her O
authoritative O
manner O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
from O
the O
pride O
of O
her O
nephew O
, O
who O
chuses O
that O
every O
one O
connected O
with O
him O
should O
have O
an O
understanding O
of O
the O
first O
class O
. O
" O
Elizabeth O
allowed O
that O
he O
had O
given O
a O
very O
rational O
account O
of O
it O
, O
and O
they O
continued O
talking O
together O
with O
mutual O
satisfaction O

supper O
put O
an O
end O
to O
cards O

gave O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
ladies O
their O
share O
of O
Mr O

Wickham O

There O
could O
be O
no O
conversation O
in O
the O
noise O
of O
Mrs. O
Philips O

supper O

his O
manners O
recommended O
him O
to O
every O
body O

Whatever O
he O
said O

was O
said O
well O
; O

whatever O
he O
did O

Elizabeth O
went O
away O
with O
her O
head O
full O
of O

could O
think O

nothing O

of O

of O
what O
he O

told O
her O

all O

there O
was O
not O

went O
