Elizabeth O
passed O
the O
chief O
of O
the O
night O
in O
her O
sister O
's O
room O
, O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
being O
able O
to O
send O
a O
tolerable O
answer O
to O
the O
enquiries O
which O
she O
very O
early O
received O
from O
Mr. O
Bingley O
by O
a O
housemaid O
, O
and O
some O
time O
afterwards O
from O
the O
two O
elegant O
ladies O
who O
waited O
on O
his O
sisters O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
this O
amendment O
, O
however O
, O
she O
requested O
to O
have O
a O
note O
sent O
to O
Longbourn O
, O
desiring O
her O
mother O
to O
visit O
Jane O
, O
and O
form O
her O
own O
judgment O
of O
her O
situation O
. O
The O
note O
was O
immediately O
dispatched O
, O
and O
its O
contents O
as O
quickly O
complied O
with O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
accompanied O
by O
her O
two O
youngest O
girls O
, O
reached O
Netherfield O
soon O
after O
the O
family O
breakfast O
. O
Had O
she O
found O
Jane O
in O
any O
apparent O
danger O
, O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
would O
have O
been O
very O
miserable O
; O
but O
being O
satisfied O
on O
seeing O
her O
that O
her O
illness O
was O
not O
alarming O
, O
she O
had O
no O
wish O
of O
her O
recovering O
immediately O
, O
as O
her O
restoration O
to O
health O
would O
probably O
remove O
her O
from O
Netherfield O
. O
She O
would O
not O
listen O
therefore O
to O
her O
daughter O
's O
proposal O
of O
being O
carried O
home O
; O
neither O
did O
the O
apothecary O
, O
who O
arrived O
about O
the O
same O
time O
, O
think O
it O
at O
all O
advisable O
. O
After O
sitting O
a O
little O
while O
with O
Jane O
, O
on O
Miss O
Bingley O
's O
appearance O
and O
invitation O
, O
the O
mother O
and O
three O
daughters O
all O
attended O
her O
into O
the O
breakfast O
parlour O
. O
Bingley O
met O
them O
with O
hopes O
that O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
had O
not O
found O
Miss O
Bennet O
worse O
than O
she O
expected O
. O
" O
Indeed O
I O
have O
, O
Sir O
, O
" O
was O
her O
answer O
. O
" O
She O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
too O
ill O
to O
be O
moved O
. O
Mr. O
Jones O
says O
we O
must O
not O
think O
of O
moving O
her O
. O
We O
must O
trespass O
a O
little O
longer O
on O
your O
kindness O
. O
" O
" O
Removed O
! O
" O
cried O
Bingley O
. O
" O
It O
must O
not O
be O
thought O
of O
. O
My O
sister O
, O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
will O
not O
hear O
of O
her O
removal O
. O
" O
" O
You O
may O
depend O
upon O
it O
, O
Madam O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
with O
cold O
civility O
, O
" O
that O
Miss O
Bennet O
shall O
receive O
every O
possible O
attention O
while O
she O
remains O
with O
us O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
profuse O
in O
her O
acknowledgments O
. O
" O
I O
am O
sure O
, O
" O
she O
added O
, O
" O
if O
it O
was O
not O
for O
such O
good O
friends O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
would O
become O
of O
her O
, O
for O
she O
is O
very O
ill O
indeed O
, O
and O
suffers O
a O
vast O
deal O
, O
though O
with O
the O
greatest O
patience O
in O
the O
world O
, O
which O
is O
always O
the O
way O
with O
her O
, O
for O
she O
has O
, O
without O
exception O
, O
the O
sweetest O
temper O
I O
ever O
met O
with O
. O
I O
often O
tell O
my O
other O
girls O
they O
are O
nothing O
to O
_her_ O
. O
You O
have O
a O
sweet O
room O
here O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
and O
a O
charming O
prospect O
over O
that O
gravel O
walk O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
a O
place O
in O
the O
country O
that O
is O
equal O
to O
Netherfield O
. O
You O
will O
not O
think O
of O
quitting O
it O
in O
a O
hurry O
I O
hope O
, O
though O
you O
have O
but O
a O
short O
lease O
. O
" O
" O
Whatever O
I O
do O
is O
done O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
" O
replied O
he O
; O
" O
and O
therefore O
if O
I O
should O
resolve O
to O
quit O
Netherfield O
, O
I O
should O
probably O
be O
off O
in O
five O
minutes O
. O
At O
present O
, O
however O
, O
I O
consider O
myself O
as O
quite O
fixed O
here O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
exactly O
what O
I O
should O
have O
supposed O
of O
you O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
You O
begin O
to O
comprehend O
me O
, O
do O
you O
? O
" O
cried O
he O
, O
turning O
towards O
her O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
yes O
-- O
I O
understand O
you O
perfectly O
. O
" O
" O
I O
wish O
I O
might O
take O
this O
for O
a O
compliment O
; O
but O
to O
be O
so O
easily O
seen O
through O
I O
am O
afraid O
is O
pitiful O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
as O
it O
happens O
. O
It O
does O
not O
necessarily O
follow O
that O
a O
deep O
, O
intricate O
character O
is O
more O
or O
less O
estimable O
than O
such O
a O
one O
as O
yours O
. O
" O
" O
Lizzy O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
mother O
, O
" O
remember O
where O
you O
are O
, O
and O
do O
not O
run O
on O
in O
the O
wild O
manner O
that O
you O
are O
suffered O
to O
do O
at O
home O
. O
" O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
before O
, O
" O
continued O
Bingley O
immediately O
, O
" O
that O
you O
were O
a O
studier O
of O
character O
. O
It O
must O
be O
an O
amusing O
study O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
; O
but O
intricate O
characters O
are O
the O
_most_ O
amusing O
. O
They O
have O
at O
least O
that O
advantage O
. O
" O
" O
The O
country O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
, O
" O
can O
in O
general O
supply O
but O
few O
subjects O
for O
such O
a O
study O
. O
In O
a O
country O
neighbourhood O
you O
move O
in O
a O
very O
confined O
and O
unvarying O
society O
. O
" O
" O
But O
people O
themselves O
alter O
so O
much O
, O
that O
there O
is O
something O
new O
to O
be O
observed O
in O
them O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
indeed O
, O
" O
cried O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
offended O
by O
his O
manner O
of O
mentioning O
a O
country O
neighbourhood O
. O
" O
I O
assure O
you O
there O
is O
quite O
as O
much O
of O
_that_ O
going O
on O
in O
the O
country O
as O
in O
town O
. O
" O
Every O
body O
was O
surprised O
; O
and O
Darcy O
, O
after O
looking O
at O
her O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
turned O
silently O
away O
. O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
, O
who O
fancied O
she O
had O
gained O
a O
complete O
victory O
over O
him O
, O
continued O
her O
triumph O
. O
" O
I O
can O
not O
see O
that O
London O
has O
any O
great O
advantage O
over O
the O
country O
for O
my O
part O
, O
except O
the O
shops O
and O
public O
places O
. O
The O
country O
is O
a O
vast O
deal O
pleasanter O
, O
is O
not O
it O
, O
Mr O
. O
Bingley O
? O
" O
" O
When O
I O
am O
in O
the O
country O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
I O
never O
wish O
to O
leave O
it O
; O
and O
when O
I O
am O
in O
town O
it O
is O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
. O
They O
have O
each O
their O
advantages O
, O
and O
I O
can O
be O
equally O
happy O
in O
either O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
-- O
that O
is O
because O
you O
have O
the O
right O
disposition O
. O
But O
that O
gentleman O
, O
" O
looking O
at O
Darcy O
, O
" O
seemed O
to O
think O
the O
country O
was O
nothing O
at O
all O
. O
" O
" O
Indeed O
, O
Mama O
, O
you O
are O
mistaken O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
blushing O
for O
her O
mother O
. O
" O
You O
quite O
mistook O
Mr. O
Darcy O
. O
He O
only O
meant O
that O
there O
were O
not O
such O
a O
variety O
of O
people O
to O
be O
met O
with O
in O
the O
country O
as O
in O
town O
, O
which O
you O
must O
acknowledge O
to O
be O
true O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
nobody O
said O
there O
were O
; O
but O
as O
to O
not O
meeting O
with O
many O
people O
in O
this O
neighbourhood O
, O
I O
believe O
there O
are O
few O
neighbourhoods O
larger O
. O
I O
know O
we O
dine O
with O
four O
and O
twenty O
families O
. O
" O
Nothing O
but O
concern O
for O
Elizabeth O
could O
enable O
Bingley O
to O
keep O
his O
countenance O
. O
His O
sister O
was O
less O
delicate O
, O
and O
directed O
her O
eye O
towards O
Mr. O
Darcy O
with O
a O
very O
expressive O
smile O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
saying O
something O
that O
might O
turn O
her O
mother O
's O
thoughts O
, O
now O
asked O
her O
if O
Charlotte O
Lucas O
had O
been O
at O
Longbourn O
since O
_her_ O
coming O
away O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
she O
called O
yesterday O
with O
her O
father O
. O
What O
an O
agreeable O
man O
Sir O
William O
is O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
-- O
is O
not O
he O
? O
so O
much O
the O
man O
of O
fashion O
! O
so O
genteel O
and O
so O
easy O
! O
-- O
He O
has O
always O
something O
to O
say O
to O
every O
body. O
-- O
_That_ O
is O
my O
idea O
of O
good O
breeding O
; O
and O
those O
persons O
who O
fancy O
themselves O
very O
important O
and O
never O
open O
their O
mouths O
, O
quite O
mistake O
the O
matter O
. O
" O
" O
Did O
Charlotte O
dine O
with O
you O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
she O
would O
go O
home O
. O
I O
fancy O
she O
was O
wanted O
about O
the O
mince O
pies O
. O
For O
my O
part O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
_I_ O
always O
keep O
servants O
that O
can O
do O
their O
own O
work O
; O
_my_ O
daughters O
are O
brought O
up O
differently O
. O
But O
every O
body O
is O
to O
judge O
for O
themselves O
, O
and O
the O
Lucases O
are O
very O
good O
sort O
of O
girls O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
. O
It O
is O
a O
pity O
they O
are O
not O
handsome O
! O
Not O
that O
_I_ O
think O
Charlotte O
so O
_very_ O
plain O
-- O
but O
then O
she O
is O
our O
particular O
friend O
. O
" O
" O
She O
seems O
a O
very O
pleasant O
young O
woman O
, O
" O
said O
Bingley O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
dear O
, O
yes O
; O
-- O
but O
you O
must O
own O
she O
is O
very O
plain O
. O
Lady O
Lucas O
herself O
has O
often O
said O
so O
, O
and O
envied O
me O
Jane O
's O
beauty O
. O
I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
boast O
of O
my O
own O
child O
, O
but O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
Jane O
-- O
one O
does O
not O
often O
see O
any O
body O
better O
looking O
. O
It O
is O
what O
every O
body O
says O
. O
I O
do O
not O
trust O
my O
own O
partiality O
. O
When O
she O
was O
only O
fifteen O
, O
there O
was O
a O
gentleman O
at O
my O
brother O
Gardiner O
's O
in O
town O
, O
so O
much O
in O
love O
with O
her O
, O
that O
my O
sister-in-law O
was O
sure O
he O
would O
make O
her O
an O
offer O
before O
we O
came O
away O
. O
But O
however O
he O
did O
not O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
thought O
her O
too O
young O
. O
However O
, O
he O
wrote O
some O
verses O
on O
her O
, O
and O
very O
pretty O
they O
were O
. O
" O
" O
And O
so O
ended O
his O
affection O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
impatiently O
. O
" O
There O
has O
been O
many O
a O
one O
, O
I O
fancy O
, O
overcome O
in O
the O
same O
way O
. O
I O
wonder O
who O
first O
discovered O
the O
efficacy O
of O
poetry O
in O
driving O
away O
love O
! O
" O
" O
I O
have O
been O
used O
to O
consider O
poetry O
as O
the O
_food_ O
of O
love O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
. O
" O
Of O
a O
fine O
, O
stout O
, O
healthy O
love O
it O
may O
. O
Every O
thing O
nourishes O
what O
is O
strong O
already O
. O
But O
if O
it O
be O
only O
a O
slight O
, O
thin O
sort O
of O
inclination O
, O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
one O
good O
sonnet O
will O
starve O
it O
entirely O
away O
. O
" O
Darcy O
only O
smiled O
; O
and O
the O
general O
pause O
which O
ensued O
made O
Elizabeth O
tremble O
lest O
her O
mother O
should O
be O
exposing O
herself O
again O
. O
She O
longed O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
could O
think O
of O
nothing O
to O
say O
; O
and O
after O
a O
short O
silence O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
began O
repeating O
her O
thanks O
to O
Mr. O
Bingley O
for O
his O
kindness O
to O
Jane O
, O
with O
an O
apology O
for O
troubling O
him O
also O
with O
Lizzy O
. O
Mr. O
Bingley O
was O
unaffectedly O
civil O
in O
his O
answer O
, O
and O
forced O
his O
younger O
sister O
to O
be O
civil O
also O
, O
and O
say O
what O
the O
occasion O
required O
. O
She O
performed O
her O
part O
indeed O
without O
much O
graciousness O
, O
but O
Mrs. O
Bennet O
was O
satisfied O
, O
and O
soon O
afterwards O
ordered O
her O
carriage O
. O
Upon O
this O
signal O
, O
the O
youngest O
of O
her O
daughters O
put O
herself O
forward O
. O
The O
two O
girls O
had O
been O
whispering O
to O
each O
other O
during O
the O
whole O
visit O
, O
and O
the O
result O
of O
it O
was O
, O
that O
the O
youngest O
should O
tax O
Mr. O
Bingley O
with O
having O
promised O
on O
his O
first O
coming O
into O
the O
country O
to O
give O
a O
ball O
at O
Netherfield O
. O
Lydia O
was O
a O
stout O
, O
well-grown O
girl O
of O
fifteen O
, O
with O
a O
fine O
complexion O
and O
good-humoured O
countenance O
; O
a O
favourite O
with O
her O
mother O
, O
whose O
affection O
had O
brought O
her O
into O
public O
at O
an O
early O
age O
. O
She O
had O
high O
animal O
spirits O
, O
and O
a O
sort O
of O
natural O
self-consequence O
, O
which O
the O
attentions O
of O
the O
officers O
, O
to O
whom O
her O
uncle O
's O
good O
dinners O
and O
her O
own O
easy O
manners O
recommended O
her O
, O
had O
increased O
into O
assurance O
. O
She O
was O
very O
equal O
therefore O
to O
address O
Mr. O
Bingley O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
ball O
, O
and O
abruptly O
reminded O
him O
of O
his O
promise O
; O
adding O
, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
the O
most O
shameful O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
if O
he O
did O
not O
keep O
it O
. O
His O
answer O
to O
this O
sudden O
attack O
was O
delightful O
to O
their O
mother O
's O
ear O
. O
" O
I O
am O
perfectly O
ready O
, O
I O
assure O
you O
, O
to O
keep O
my O
engagement O
; O
and O
when O
your O
sister O
is O
recovered O
, O
you O
shall O
if O
you O
please O
name O
the O
very O
day O
of O
the O
ball O
. O
But O
you O
would O
not O
wish O
to O
be O
dancing O
while O
she O
is O
ill O
. O
" O
Lydia O
declared O
herself O
satisfied O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
yes O
-- O
it O
would O
be O
much O
better O
to O
wait O
till O
Jane O
was O
well O
, O
and O
by O
that O
time O
most O
likely O
Captain O
Carter O
would O
be O
at O
Meryton O
again O
. O
And O
when O
you O
