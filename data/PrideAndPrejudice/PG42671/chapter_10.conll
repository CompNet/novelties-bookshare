The O
day O
passed O
much O
as O
the O
day O
before O
had O
done O
. O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
had O
spent O
some O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
with O
the O
invalid O
, O
who O
continued O
, O
though O
slowly O
, O
to O
mend O
; O
and O
in O
the O
evening O
Elizabeth O
joined O
their O
party O
in O
the O
drawing-room O
. O
The O
loo O
table O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
appear O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
was O
writing O
, O
and O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
seated O
near O
him O
, O
was O
watching O
the O
progress O
of O
his O
letter O
, O
and O
repeatedly O
calling O
off O
his O
attention O
by O
messages O
to O
his O
sister O
. O
Mr. O
Hurst O
and O
Mr. O
Bingley O
were O
at O
piquet O
, O
and O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
was O
observing O
their O
game O
. O
Elizabeth O
took O
up O
some O
needlework O
, O
and O
was O
sufficiently O
amused O
in O
attending O
to O
what O
passed O
between O
Darcy O
and O
his O
companion O
. O
The O
perpetual O
commendations O
of O
the O
lady O
either O
on O
his O
hand-writing O
, O
or O
on O
the O
evenness O
of O
his O
lines O
, O
or O
on O
the O
length O
of O
his O
letter O
, O
with O
the O
perfect O
unconcern O
with O
which O
her O
praises O
were O
received O
, O
formed O
a O
curious O
dialogue O
, O
and O
was O
exactly O
in O
unison O
with O
her O
opinion O
of O
each O
. O
" O
How O
delighted O
Miss O
Darcy O
will O
be O
to O
receive O
such O
a O
letter O
! O
" O
He O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
" O
You O
write O
uncommonly O
fast O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
mistaken O
. O
I O
write O
rather O
slowly O
. O
" O
" O
How O
many O
letters O
you O
must O
have O
occasion O
to O
write O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
year O
! O
Letters O
of O
business O
too O
! O
How O
odious O
I O
should O
think O
them O
! O
" O
" O
It O
is O
fortunate O
, O
then O
, O
that O
they O
fall O
to O
my O
lot O
instead O
of O
to O
yours O
. O
" O
" O
Pray O
tell O
your O
sister O
that O
I O
long O
to O
see O
her O
. O
" O
" O
I O
have O
already O
told O
her O
so O
once O
, O
by O
your O
desire O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
do O
not O
like O
your O
pen O
. O
Let O
me O
mend O
it O
for O
you O
. O
I O
mend O
pens O
remarkably O
well O
. O
" O
" O
Thank O
you O
-- O
but O
I O
always O
mend O
my O
own O
. O
" O
" O
How O
can O
you O
contrive O
to O
write O
so O
even O
? O
" O
He O
was O
silent O
. O
" O
Tell O
your O
sister O
I O
am O
delighted O
to O
hear O
of O
her O
improvement O
on O
the O
harp O
, O
and O
pray O
let O
her O
know O
that O
I O
am O
quite O
in O
raptures O
with O
her O
beautiful O
little O
design O
for O
a O
table O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
infinitely O
superior O
to O
Miss O
Grantley O
's O
. O
" O
" O
Will O
you O
give O
me O
leave O
to O
defer O
your O
raptures O
till O
I O
write O
again O
? O
-- O
At O
present O
I O
have O
not O
room O
to O
do O
them O
justice O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
it O
is O
of O
no O
consequence O
. O
I O
shall O
see O
her O
in O
January O
. O
But O
do O
you O
always O
write O
such O
charming O
long O
letters O
to O
her O
, O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
? O
" O
" O
They O
are O
generally O
long O
; O
but O
whether O
always O
charming O
, O
it O
is O
not O
for O
me O
to O
determine O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
a O
rule O
with O
me O
, O
that O
a O
person O
who O
can O
write O
a O
long O
letter O
, O
with O
ease O
, O
can O
not O
write O
ill O
. O
" O
" O
That O
will O
not O
do O
for O
a O
compliment O
to O
Darcy O
, O
Caroline O
, O
" O
cried O
her O
brother O
-- O
" O
because O
he O
does O
_not_ O
write O
with O
ease O
. O
He O
studies O
too O
much O
for O
words O
of O
four O
syllables. O
-- O
Do O
not O
you O
, O
Darcy O
? O
" O
" O
My O
style O
of O
writing O
is O
very O
different O
from O
yours O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
" O
cried O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
" O
Charles O
writes O
in O
the O
most O
careless O
way O
imaginable O
. O
He O
leaves O
out O
half O
his O
words O
, O
and O
blots O
the O
rest O
. O
" O
" O
My O
ideas O
flow O
so O
rapidly O
that O
I O
have O
not O
time O
to O
express O
them O
-- O
by O
which O
means O
my O
letters O
sometimes O
convey O
no O
ideas O
at O
all O
to O
my O
correspondents O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
humility O
, O
Mr. O
Bingley O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
must O
disarm O
reproof O
. O
" O
" O
Nothing O
is O
more O
deceitful O
, O
" O
said O
Darcy O
, O
" O
than O
the O
appearance O
of O
humility O
. O
It O
is O
often O
only O
carelessness O
of O
opinion O
, O
and O
sometimes O
an O
indirect O
boast O
. O
" O
" O
And O
which O
of O
the O
two O
do O
you O
call O
_my_ O
little O
recent O
piece O
of O
modesty O
? O
" O
" O
The O
indirect O
boast O
; O
-- O
for O
you O
are O
really O
proud O
of O
your O
defects O
in O
writing O
, O
because O
you O
consider O
them O
as O
proceeding O
from O
a O
rapidity O
of O
thought O
and O
carelessness O
of O
execution O
, O
which O
if O
not O
estimable O
, O
you O
think O
at O
least O
highly O
interesting O
. O
The O
power O
of O
doing O
any O
thing O
with O
quickness O
is O
always O
much O
prized O
by O
the O
possessor O
, O
and O
often O
without O
any O
attention O
to O
the O
imperfection O
of O
the O
performance O
. O
When O
you O
told O
Mrs O
. O
Bennet O
this O
morning O
that O
if O
you O
ever O
resolved O
on O
quitting O
Netherfield O
you O
should O
be O
gone O
in O
five O
minutes O
, O
you O
meant O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sort O
of O
panegyric O
, O
of O
compliment O
to O
yourself O
-- O
and O
yet O
what O
is O
there O
so O
very O
laudable O
in O
a O
precipitance O
which O
must O
leave O
very O
necessary O
business O
undone O
, O
and O
can O
be O
of O
no O
real O
advantage O
to O
yourself O
or O
any O
one O
else O
? O
" O
" O
Nay O
, O
" O
cried O
Bingley O
, O
" O
this O
is O
too O
much O
, O
to O
remember O
at O
night O
all O
the O
foolish O
things O
that O
were O
said O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
upon O
my O
honour O
, O
I O
believed O
what O
I O
said O
of O
myself O
to O
be O
true O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
it O
at O
this O
moment O
. O
At O
least O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
did O
not O
assume O
the O
character O
of O
needless O
precipitance O
merely O
to O
shew O
off O
before O
the O
ladies O
. O
" O
" O
I O
dare O
say O
you O
believed O
it O
; O
but O
I O
am O
by O
no O
means O
convinced O
that O
you O
would O
be O
gone O
with O
such O
celerity O
. O
Your O
conduct O
would O
be O
quite O
as O
dependant O
on O
chance O
as O
that O
of O
any O
man O
I O
know O
; O
and O
if O
, O
as O
you O
were O
mounting O
your O
horse O
, O
a O
friend O
were O
to O
say O
, O
'Bingley O
, O
you O
had O
better O
stay O
till O
next O
week O
, O
' O
you O
would O
probably O
do O
it O
, O
you O
would O
probably O
not O
go O
-- O
and O
, O
at O
another O
word O
, O
might O
stay O
a O
month O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
only O
proved O
by O
this O
, O
" O
cried O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
that O
Mr. O
Bingley O
did O
not O
do O
justice O
to O
his O
own O
disposition O
. O
You O
have O
shewn O
him O
off O
now O
much O
more O
than O
he O
did O
himself O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
exceedingly O
gratified O
, O
" O
said O
Bingley O
, O
" O
by O
your O
converting O
what O
my O
friend O
says O
into O
a O
compliment O
on O
the O
sweetness O
of O
my O
temper O
. O
But O
I O
am O
afraid O
you O
are O
giving O
it O
a O
turn O
which O
that O
gentleman O
did O
by O
no O
means O
intend O
; O
for O
he O
would O
certainly O
think O
the O
better O
of O
me O
, O
if O
under O
such O
a O
circumstance O
I O
were O
to O
give O
a O
flat O
denial O
, O
and O
ride O
off O
as O
fast O
as O
I O
could O
. O
" O
" O
Would O
Mr. O
Darcy O
then O
consider O
the O
rashness O
of O
your O
original O
intention O
as O
atoned O
for O
by O
your O
obstinacy O
in O
adhering O
to O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Upon O
my O
word O
I O
can O
not O
exactly O
explain O
the O
matter O
, O
Darcy O
must O
speak O
for O
himself O
. O
" O
" O
You O
expect O
me O
to O
account O
for O
opinions O
which O
you O
chuse O
to O
call O
mine O
, O
but O
which O
I O
have O
never O
acknowledged O
. O
Allowing O
the O
case O
, O
however O
, O
to O
stand O
according O
to O
your O
representation O
, O
you O
must O
remember O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
that O
the O
friend O
who O
is O
supposed O
to O
desire O
his O
return O
to O
the O
house O
, O
and O
the O
delay O
of O
his O
plan O
, O
has O
merely O
desired O
it O
, O
asked O
it O
without O
offering O
one O
argument O
in O
favour O
of O
its O
propriety O
. O
" O
" O
To O
yield O
readily O
-- O
easily O
-- O
to O
the O
_persuasion_ O
of O
a O
friend O
is O
no O
merit O
with O
you O
. O
" O
" O
To O
yield O
without O
conviction O
is O
no O
compliment O
to O
the O
understanding O
of O
either O
. O
" O
" O
You O
appear O
to O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
to O
allow O
nothing O
for O
the O
influence O
of O
friendship O
and O
affection O
. O
A O
regard O
for O
the O
requester O
would O
often O
make O
one O
readily O
yield O
to O
a O
request O
, O
without O
waiting O
for O
arguments O
to O
reason O
one O
into O
it O
. O
I O
am O
not O
particularly O
speaking O
of O
such O
a O
case O
as O
you O
have O
supposed O
about O
Mr. O
Bingley O
. O
We O
may O
as O
well O
wait O
, O
perhaps O
, O
till O
the O
circumstance O
occurs O
, O
before O
we O
discuss O
the O
discretion O
of O
his O
behaviour O
thereupon O
. O
But O
in O
general O
and O
ordinary O
cases O
between O
friend O
and O
friend O
, O
where O
one O
of O
them O
is O
desired O
by O
the O
other O
to O
change O
a O
resolution O
of O
no O
very O
great O
moment O
, O
should O
you O
think O
ill O
of O
that O
person O
for O
complying O
with O
the O
desire O
, O
without O
waiting O
to O
be O
argued O
into O
it O
? O
" O
" O
Will O
it O
not O
be O
advisable O
, O
before O
we O
proceed O
on O
this O
subject O
, O
to O
arrange O
with O
rather O
more O
precision O
the O
degree O
of O
importance O
which O
is O
to O
appertain O
to O
this O
request O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
degree O
of O
intimacy O
subsisting O
between O
the O
parties O
? O
" O
" O
By O
all O
means O
, O
" O
cried O
Bingley O
; O
" O
let O
us O
hear O
all O
the O
particulars O
, O
not O
forgetting O
their O
comparative O
height O
and O
size O
; O
for O
that O
will O
have O
more O
weight O
in O
the O
argument O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
than O
you O
may O
be O
aware O
of O
. O
I O
assure O
you O
that O
if O
Darcy O
were O
not O
such O
a O
great O
tall O
fellow O
, O
in O
comparison O
with O
myself O
, O
I O
should O
not O
pay O
him O
half O
so O
much O
deference O
. O
I O
declare O
I O
do O
not O
know O
a O
more O
aweful O
object O
than O
Darcy O
, O
on O
particular O
occasions O
, O
and O
in O
particular O
places O
; O
at O
his O
own O
house O
especially O
, O
and O
of O
a O
Sunday O
evening O
when O
he O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
smiled O
; O
but O
Elizabeth O
thought O
she O
could O
perceive O
that O
he O
was O
rather O
offended O
; O
and O
therefore O
checked O
her O
laugh O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
warmly O
resented O
the O
indignity O
he O
had O
received O
, O
in O
an O
expostulation O
with O
her O
brother O
for O
talking O
such O
nonsense O
. O
" O
I O
see O
your O
design O
, O
Bingley O
, O
" O
said O
his O
friend. O
-- O
" O
You O
dislike O
an O
argument O
, O
and O
want O
to O
silence O
this O
. O
" O
" O
Perhaps O
I O
do O
. O
Arguments O
are O
too O
much O
like O
disputes O
. O
If O
you O
and O
Miss O
Bennet O
will O
defer O
yours O
till O
I O
am O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
very O
thankful O
; O
and O
then O
you O
may O
say O
whatever O
you O
like O
of O
me O
. O
" O
" O
What O
you O
ask O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
is O
no O
sacrifice O
on O
my O
side O
; O
and O
Mr O
. O
Darcy O
had O
much O
better O
finish O
his O
letter O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Darcy O
took O
her O
advice O
, O
and O
did O
finish O
his O
letter O
. O
When O
that O
business O
was O
over O
, O
he O
applied O
to O
Miss O
Bingley O
and O
Elizabeth O
for O
the O
indulgence O
of O
some O
music O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
moved O
with O
alacrity O
to O
the O
piano-forte O
, O
and O
after O
a O
polite O
request O
that O
Elizabeth O
would O
lead O
the O
way O
, O
which O
the O
other O
as O
politely O
and O
more O
earnestly O
negatived O
, O
she O
seated O
herself O
. O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
sang O
with O
her O
sister O
, O
and O
while O
they O
were O
thus O
employed O
Elizabeth O
could O
not O
help O
observing O
as O
she O
turned O
over O
some O
music O
books O
that O
lay O
on O
the O
instrument O
, O
how O
frequently O
Mr. O
Darcy O
's O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
on O
her O
. O
She O
hardly O
knew O
how O
to O
suppose O
that O
she O
could O
be O
an O
object O
of O
admiration O
to O
so O
great O
a O
man O
; O
and O
yet O
that O
he O
should O
look O
at O
her O
because O
he O
disliked O
her O
, O
was O
still O
more O
strange O
. O
She O
could O
only O
imagine O
however O
at O
last O
, O
that O
she O
drew O
his O
notice O
because O
there O
was O
a O
something O
about O
her O
more O
wrong O
and O
reprehensible O
, O
according O
to O
his O
ideas O
of O
right O
, O
than O
in O
any O
other O
person O
present O
. O
The O
supposition O
did O
not O
pain O
her O
. O
She O
liked O
him O
too O
little O
to O
care O
for O
his O
approbation O
. O
After O
playing O
some O
Italian O
songs O
, O
Miss O
Bingley O
varied O
the O
charm O
by O
a O
lively O
Scotch O
air O
; O
and O
soon O
afterwards O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
drawing O
near O
Elizabeth O
, O
said O
to O
her O
-- O
" O
Do O
not O
you O
feel O
a O
great O
inclination O
, O
Miss O
Bennet O
, O
to O
seize O
such O
an O
opportunity O
of O
dancing O
a O
reel O
? O
" O
She O
smiled O
, O
but O
made O
no O
answer O
. O
He O
repeated O
the O
question O
, O
with O
some O
surprise O
at O
her O
silence O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
I O
heard O
you O
before O
; O
but O
I O
could O
not O
immediately O
determine O
what O
to O
say O
in O
reply O
. O
You O
wanted O
me O
, O
I O
know O
, O
to O
say O
'Yes O
, O
' O
that O
you O
might O
have O
the O
pleasure O
of O
despising O
my O
taste O
; O
but O
I O
always O
delight O
in O
overthrowing O
those O
kind O
of O
schemes O
, O
and O
cheating O
a O
person O
of O
their O
premeditated O
contempt O
. O
I O
have O
therefore O
made O
up O
my O
mind O
to O
tell O
you O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
dance O
a O
reel O
at O
all O
-- O
and O
now O
despise O
me O
if O
you O
dare O
. O
" O

Indeed O
I O
do O
not O
dare O

Elizabeth O
, O
having O
rather O
expected O
to O
affront O
him O
, O
was O
amazed O
at O
his O
gallantry O
; O
but O
there O
was O
a O
mixture O
of O
sweetness O
and O
archness O
in O
her O
manner O
which O
made O
it O
difficult O
for O
her O
to O
affront O
anybody O
; O
and O
Darcy O
had O
never O
been O
so O
bewitched O
by O
any O
woman O
as O
he O
was O
by O
her O
. O
He O
really O
believed O
, O
that O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
inferiority O
of O
her O
connections O
, O
he O
should O
be O
in O
some O
danger O
. O
Miss O
Bingley O
saw O
, O
or O
suspected O
enough O
to O
be O
jealous O
; O
and O
her O
great O
anxiety O
for O
the O
recovery O
of O
her O
dear O
friend O
Jane O
, O
received O
some O
assistance O
from O
her O
desire O
of O
getting O
rid O
of O
Elizabeth O
. O
She O
often O
tried O
to O
provoke O
Darcy O
into O
disliking O
her O
guest O
, O
by O
talking O
of O
their O
supposed O
marriage O
, O
and O
planning O
his O
happiness O
in O
such O
an O
alliance O
. O
" O
I O
hope O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
as O
they O
were O
walking O
together O
in O
the O
shrubbery O
the O
next O
day O
, O
" O
you O
will O
give O
your O
mother-in-law O
a O
few O
hints O
, O
when O
this O
desirable O
event O
takes O
place O
, O
as O
to O
the O
advantage O
of O
holding O
her O
tongue O
; O
and O
if O
you O
can O
compass O
it O
, O
do O
cure O
the O
younger O
girls O
of O
running O
after O
the O
officers. O
-- O
And O
, O
if O
I O
may O
mention O
so O
delicate O
a O
subject O
, O
endeavour O
to O
check O
that O
little O
something O
, O
bordering O
on O
conceit O
and O
impertinence O
, O
which O
your O
lady O
possesses O
. O
" O
" O
Have O
you O
any O
thing O
else O
to O
propose O
for O
my O
domestic O
felicity O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
yes. O
-- O
Do O
let O
the O
portraits O
of O
your O
uncle O
and O
aunt O
Philips O
be O
placed O
in O
the O
gallery O
at O
Pemberley O
. O
Put O
them O
next O
to O
your O
great O
uncle O
the O
judge O
. O
They O
are O
in O
the O
same O
profession O
, O
you O
know O
; O
only O
in O
different O
lines O
. O
As O
for O
your O
Elizabeth O
's O
picture O
, O
you O
must O
not O
attempt O
to O
have O
it O
taken O
, O
for O
what O
painter O
could O
do O
justice O
to O
those O
beautiful O
eyes O
? O
" O
" O
It O
would O
not O
be O
easy O
, O
indeed O
, O
to O
catch O
their O
expression O
, O
but O
their O
colour O
and O
shape O
, O
and O
the O
eye-lashes O
, O
so O
remarkably O
fine O
, O
might O
be O
copied O
. O
" O
At O
that O
moment O
they O
were O
met O
from O
another O
walk O
, O
by O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
and O
Elizabeth O
herself O
. O
" O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
you O
intended O
to O
walk O
, O
" O
said O
Miss O
Bingley O
, O
in O
some O
confusion O
, O
lest O
they O
had O
been O
overheard O
. O
" O
You O
used O
us O
abominably O
ill O
, O
" O
answered O
Mrs. O
Hurst O
, O
" O
in O
running O
away O
without O
telling O
us O
that O
you O
were O
coming O
out O
. O
" O
Then O
taking O
the O
disengaged O
arm O
of O
Mr. O
Darcy O
, O
she O
left O
Elizabeth O
to O
walk O
by O
herself O
. O
The O
path O
just O
admitted O
three O
. O
Mr. O
Darcy O
felt O
their O
rudeness O
and O
immediately O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
This O
walk O
is O
not O
wide O
enough O
for O
our O
party O
. O
We O
had O
better O
go O
into O
the O
avenue O
. O
" O
But O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
had O
not O
the O
least O
inclination O
to O
remain O
with O
them O
, O
laughingly O
answered O
, O
" O
No O
, O
no O
; O
stay O
where O
you O
are. O
-- O
You O
are O
charmingly O
group O
'd O
, O
and O
appear O
to O
uncommon O
advantage O
. O
The O
picturesque O
would O
be O
spoilt O
by O
admitting O
a O
fourth O
. O
Good O
bye O
. O
" O
She O
then O
ran O
gaily O
off O
, O
rejoicing O
as O
she O
rambled O
about O
, O
in O
the O
hope O
of O
being O
at O
home O
again O
in O
a O
day O
or O
two O
. O
Jane O
was O
already O
so O
much O
recovered O
as O
to O
intend O
leaving O
her O
room O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
that O
evening O
. O
