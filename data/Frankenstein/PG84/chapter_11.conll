On O
my O
return O
, O
I O
found O
the O
following O
letter O
from O
my O
father O
: O
— O
" O
My O
dear O
Victor O
, O
" O
You O
have O
probably O
waited O
impatiently O
for O
a O
letter O
to O
fix O
the O
date O
of O
your O
return O
to O
us O
; O
and O
I O
was O
at O
first O
tempted O
to O
write O
only O
a O
few O
lines O
, O
merely O
mentioning O
the O
day O
on O
which O
I O
should O
expect O
you O
. O
But O
that O
would O
be O
a O
cruel O
kindness O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
not O
do O
it O
. O
What O
would O
be O
your O
surprise O
, O
my O
son O
, O
when O
you O
expected O
a O
happy O
and O
glad O
welcome O
, O
to O
behold O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
tears O
and O
wretchedness O
? O
And O
how O
, O
Victor O
, O
can O
I O
relate O
our O
misfortune O
? O
Absence O
can O
not O
have O
rendered O
you O
callous O
to O
our O
joys O
and O
griefs O
; O
and O
how O
shall O
I O
inflict O
pain O
on O
my O
long O
absent O
son O
? O
I O
wish O
to O
prepare O
you O
for O
the O
woeful O
news O
, O
but O
I O
know O
it O
is O
impossible O
; O
even O
now O
your O
eye O
skims O
over O
the O
page O
to O
seek O
the O
words O
which O
are O
to O
convey O
to O
you O
the O
horrible O
tidings O
. O
" O
William O
is O
dead O
! O
—that O
sweet O
child O
, O
whose O
smiles O
delighted O
and O
warmed O
my O
heart O
, O
who O
was O
so O
gentle O
, O
yet O
so O
gay O
! O
Victor O
, O
he O
is O
murdered O
! O
" O
I O
will O
not O
attempt O
to O
console O
you O
; O
but O
will O
simply O
relate O
the O
circumstances O
of O
the O
transaction O
. O
" O
Last O
Thursday O
( O
May O
7th O
) O
, O
I O
, O
my O
niece O
, O
and O
your O
two O
brothers O
, O
went O
to O
walk O
in O
Plainpalais O
. O
The O
evening O
was O
warm O
and O
serene O
, O
and O
we O
prolonged O
our O
walk O
farther O
than O
usual O
. O
It O
was O
already O
dusk O
before O
we O
thought O
of O
returning O
; O
and O
then O
we O
discovered O
that O
William O
and O
Ernest O
, O
who O
had O
gone O
on O
before O
, O
were O
not O
to O
be O
found O
. O
We O
accordingly O
rested O
on O
a O
seat O
until O
they O
should O
return O
. O
Presently O
Ernest O
came O
, O
and O
enquired O
if O
we O
had O
seen O
his O
brother O
; O
he O
said O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
playing O
with O
him O
, O
that O
William O
had O
run O
away O
to O
hide O
himself O
, O
and O
that O
he O
vainly O
sought O
for O
him O
, O
and O
afterwards O
waited O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
that O
he O
did O
not O
return O
. O
" O
This O
account O
rather O
alarmed O
us O
, O
and O
we O
continued O
to O
search O
for O
him O
until O
night O
fell O
, O
when O
Elizabeth O
conjectured O
that O
he O
might O
have O
returned O
to O
the O
house O
. O
He O
was O
not O
there O
. O
We O
returned O
again O
, O
with O
torches O
; O
for O
I O
could O
not O
rest O
, O
when O
I O
thought O
that O
my O
sweet O
boy O
had O
lost O
himself O
, O
and O
was O
exposed O
to O
all O
the O
damps O
and O
dews O
of O
night O
; O
Elizabeth O
also O
suffered O
extreme O
anguish O
. O
About O
five O
in O
the O
morning O
I O
discovered O
my O
lovely O
boy O
, O
whom O
the O
night O
before O
I O
had O
seen O
blooming O
and O
active O
in O
health O
, O
stretched O
on O
the O
grass O
livid O
and O
motionless O
; O
the O
print O
of O
the O
murder O
's O
finger O
was O
on O
his O
neck O
. O
" O
He O
was O
conveyed O
home O
, O
and O
the O
anguish O
that O
was O
visible O
in O
my O
countenance O
betrayed O
the O
secret O
to O
Elizabeth O
. O
She O
was O
very O
earnest O
to O
see O
the O
corpse O
. O
At O
first O
I O
attempted O
to O
prevent O
her O
but O
she O
persisted O
, O
and O
entering O
the O
room O
where O
it O
lay O
, O
hastily O
examined O
the O
neck O
of O
the O
victim O
, O
and O
clasping O
her O
hands O
exclaimed O
, O
' O
O O
God O
! O
I O
have O
murdered O
my O
darling O
child O
! O
' O
" O
She O
fainted O
, O
and O
was O
restored O
with O
extreme O
difficulty O
. O
When O
she O
again O
lived O
, O
it O
was O
only O
to O
weep O
and O
sigh O
. O
She O
told O
me O
, O
that O
that O
same O
evening O
William O
had O
teased O
her O
to O
let O
him O
wear O
a O
very O
valuable O
miniature O
that O
she O
possessed O
of O
your O
mother O
. O
This O
picture O
is O
gone O
, O
and O
was O
doubtless O
the O
temptation O
which O
urged O
the O
murderer O
to O
the O
deed O
. O
We O
have O
no O
trace O
of O
him O
at O
present O
, O
although O
our O
exertions O
to O
discover O
him O
are O
unremitted O
; O
but O
they O
will O
not O
restore O
my O
beloved O
William O
! O
" O
Come O
, O
dearest O
Victor O
; O
you O
alone O
can O
console O
Elizabeth O
. O
She O
weeps O
continually O
, O
and O
accuses O
herself O
unjustly O
as O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
death O
; O
her O
words O
pierce O
my O
heart O
. O
We O
are O
all O
unhappy O
; O
but O
will O
not O
that O
be O
an O
additional O
motive O
for O
you O
, O
my O
son O
, O
to O
return O
and O
be O
our O
comforter O
? O
Your O
dear O
mother O
! O
Alas O
, O
Victor O
! O
I O
now O
say O
, O
Thank O
God O
she O
did O
not O
live O
to O
witness O
the O
cruel O
, O
miserable O
death O
of O
her O
youngest O
darling O
! O
" O
Come O
, O
Victor O
; O
not O
brooding O
thoughts O
of O
vengeance O
against O
the O
assassin O
, O
but O
with O
feelings O
of O
peace O
and O
gentleness O
, O
that O
will O
heal O
, O
instead O
of O
festering O
, O
the O
wounds O
of O
our O
minds O
. O
Enter O
the O
house O
of O
mourning O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
but O
with O
kindness O
and O
affection O
for O
those O
who O
love O
you O
, O
and O
not O
with O
hatred O
for O
your O
enemies O
. O
" O
Your O
affectionate O
and O
afflicted O
father O
, O

. O
" O
Clerval O
, O
who O
had O
watched O
my O
countenance O
as O
I O
read O
this O
letter O
, O
was O
surprised O
to O
observe O
the O
despair O
that O
succeeded O
the O
joy O
I O
at O
first O
expressed O
on O
receiving O
news O
from O
my O
friends O
. O
I O
threw O
the O
letter O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
covered O
my O
face O
with O
my O
hands O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Frankenstein O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
Henry O
, O
when O
he O
perceived O
me O
weep O
with O
bitterness O
, O
" O
are O
you O
always O
to O
be O
unhappy O
? O
My O
dear O
friend O
, O
what O
has O
happened O
? O
" O
I O
motioned O
him O
to O
take O
up O
the O
letter O
, O
while O
I O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
the O
room O
in O
the O
extremest O
agitation O
. O
Tears O
also O
gushed O
from O
the O
eyes O
of O
Clerval O
, O
as O
he O
read O
the O
account O
of O
my O
misfortune O
. O
" O
I O
can O
offer O
you O
no O
consolation O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
" O
said O
he O
; O
" O
your O
disaster O
is O
irreparable O
. O
What O
do O
you O
intend O
to O
do O
? O
" O
" O
To O
go O
instantly O
to O
Geneva O
: O
come O
with O
me O
, O
Henry O
, O
to O
order O
the O
horses O
. O
" O
During O
our O
walk O
, O
Clerval O
endeavoured O
to O
say O
a O
few O
words O
of O
consolation O
; O
he O
could O
only O
express O
his O
heartfelt O
sympathy O
. O
" O
Poor O
William O
! O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
dear O
lovely O
child O
, O
he O
now O
sleeps O
with O
his O
angel O
mother O
! O
Who O
that O
had O
seen O
him O
bright O
and O
joyous O
in O
his O
young O
beauty O
, O
but O
must O
weep O
over O
his O
untimely O
loss O
! O
To O
die O
so O
miserably O
; O
to O
feel O
the O
murderer O
's O
grasp O
! O
How O
much O
more O
a O
murdered O
that O
could O
destroy O
radiant O
innocence O
! O
Poor O
little O
fellow O
! O
one O
only O
consolation O
have O
we O
; O
his O
friends O
mourn O
and O
weep O
, O
but O
he O
is O
at O
rest O
. O
The O
pang O
is O
over O
, O
his O
sufferings O
are O
at O
an O
end O
for O
ever O
. O
A O
sod O
covers O
his O
gentle O
form O
, O
and O
he O
knows O
no O
pain O
. O
He O
can O
no O
longer O
be O
a O
subject O
for O
pity O
; O
we O
must O
reserve O
that O
for O
his O
miserable O
survivors O
. O
" O
Clerval O
spoke O
thus O
as O
we O
hurried O
through O
the O
streets O
; O
the O
words O
impressed O
themselves O
on O
my O
mind O
and O
I O
remembered O
them O
afterwards O
in O
solitude O
. O
But O
now O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
horses O
arrived O
, O
I O
hurried O
into O
a O
cabriolet O
, O
and O
bade O
farewell O
to O
my O
friend O
. O
My O
journey O
was O
very O
melancholy O
. O
At O
first O
I O
wished O
to O
hurry O
on O
, O
for O
I O
longed O
to O
console O
and O
sympathise O
with O
my O
loved O
and O
sorrowing O
friends O
; O
but O
when O
I O
drew O
near O
my O
native O
town O
, O
I O
slackened O
my O
progress O
. O
I O
could O
hardly O
sustain O
the O
multitude O
of O
feelings O
that O
crowded O
into O
my O
mind O
. O
I O
passed O
through O
scenes O
familiar O
to O
my O
youth O
, O
but O
which O
I O
had O
not O
seen O
for O
nearly O
six O
years O
. O
How O
altered O
every O
thing O
might O
be O
during O
that O
time O
! O
One O
sudden O
and O
desolating O
change O
had O
taken O
place O
; O
but O
a O
thousand O
little O
circumstances O
might O
have O
by O
degrees O
worked O
other O
alterations O
, O
which O
, O
although O
they O
were O
done O
more O
tranquilly O
, O
might O
not O
be O
the O
less O
decisive O
. O
Fear O
overcame O
me O
; O
I O
dared O
no O
advance O
, O
dreading O
a O
thousand O
nameless O
evils O
that O
made O
me O
tremble O
, O
although O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
define O
them O
. O
I O
remained O
two O
days O
at O
Lausanne O
, O
in O
this O
painful O
state O
of O
mind O
. O
I O
contemplated O
the O
lake O
: O
the O
waters O
were O
placid O
; O
all O
around O
was O
calm O
; O
and O
the O
snowy O
mountains O
, O
" O
the O
palaces O
of O
nature O
, O
" O
were O
not O
changed O
. O
By O
degrees O
the O
calm O
and O
heavenly O
scene O
restored O
me O
, O
and O
I O
continued O
my O
journey O
towards O
Geneva O
. O
The O
road O
ran O
by O
the O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
, O
which O
became O
narrower O
as O
I O
approached O
my O
native O
town O
. O
I O
discovered O
more O
distinctly O
the O
black O
sides O
of O
Jura O
, O
and O
the O
bright O
summit O
of O
Mont O
Blanc O
. O
I O
wept O
like O
a O
child O
. O
" O
Dear O
mountains O
! O
my O
own O
beautiful O
lake O
! O
how O
do O
you O
welcome O
your O
wanderer O
? O
Your O
summits O
are O
clear O
; O
the O
sky O
and O
lake O
are O
blue O
and O
placid O
. O
Is O
this O
to O
prognosticate O
peace O
, O
or O
to O
mock O
at O
my O
unhappiness O
? O
" O
I O
fear O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
that O
I O
shall O
render O
myself O
tedious O
by O
dwelling O
on O
these O
preliminary O
circumstances O
; O
but O
they O
were O
days O
of O
comparative O
happiness O
, O
and O
I O
think O
of O
them O
with O
pleasure O
. O
My O
country O
, O
my O
beloved O
country O
! O
who O
but O
a O
native O
can O
tell O
the O
delight O
I O
took O
in O
again O
beholding O
thy O
streams O
, O
thy O
mountains O
, O
and O
, O
more O
than O
all O
, O
thy O
lovely O
lake O
! O
Yet O
, O
as O
I O
drew O
nearer O
home O
, O
grief O
and O
fear O
again O
overcame O
me O
. O
Night O
also O
closed O
around O
; O
and O
when O
I O
could O
hardly O
see O
the O
dark O
mountains O
, O
I O
felt O
still O
more O
gloomily O
. O
The O
picture O
appeared O
a O
vast O
and O
dim O
scene O
of O
evil O
, O
and O
I O
foresaw O
obscurely O
that O
I O
was O
destined O
to O
become O
the O
most O
wretched O
of O
human O
beings O
. O
Alas O
! O
I O
prophesied O
truly O
, O
and O
failed O
only O
in O
one O
single O
circumstance O
, O
that O
in O
all O
the O
misery O
I O
imagined O
and O
dreaded O
, O
I O
did O
not O
conceive O
the O
hundredth O
part O
of O
the O
anguish O
I O
was O
destined O
to O
endure O
. O
It O
was O
completely O
dark O
when O
I O
arrived O
in O
the O
environs O
of O
Geneva O
; O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
town O
were O
already O
shut O
; O
and O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
pass O
the O
night O
at O
Secheron O
, O
a O
village O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
half O
a O
league O
from O
the O
city O
. O
The O
sky O
was O
serene O
; O
and O
, O
as O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
rest O
, O
I O
resolved O
to O
visit O
the O
spot O
where O
my O
poor O
William O
had O
been O
murdered O
. O
As O
I O
could O
not O
pass O
through O
the O
town O
, O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
cross O
the O
lake O
in O
a O
boat O
to O
arrive O
at O
Plainpalais O
. O
During O
this O
short O
voyage O
I O
saw O
the O
lightning O
playing O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
Mont O
Blanc O
in O
the O
most O
beautiful O
figures O
. O
The O
storm O
appeared O
to O
approach O
rapidly O
, O
and O
, O
on O
landing O
, O
I O
ascended O
a O
low O
hill O
, O
that O
I O
might O
observe O
its O
progress O
. O
It O
advanced O
; O
the O
heavens O
were O
clouded O
, O
and O
I O
soon O
felt O
the O
rain O
coming O
slowly O
in O
large O
drops O
, O
but O
its O
violence O
quickly O
increased O
. O
I O
quitted O
my O
seat O
, O
and O
walked O
on O
, O
although O
the O
darkness O
and O
storm O
increased O
every O
minute O
, O
and O
the O
thunder O
burst O
with O
a O
terrific O
crash O
over O
my O
head O
. O
It O
was O
echoed O
from O
Salêve O
, O
the O
Juras O
, O
and O
the O
Alps O
of O
Savoy O
; O
vivid O
flashes O
of O
lightning O
dazzled O
my O
eyes O
, O
illuminating O
the O
lake O
, O
making O
it O
appear O
like O
a O
vast O
sheet O
of O
fire O
; O
then O
for O
an O
instant O
every O
thing O
seemed O
of O
a O
pitchy O
darkness O
, O
until O
the O
eye O
recovered O
itself O
from O
the O
preceding O
flash O
. O
The O
storm O
, O
as O
is O
often O
the O
case O
in O
Switzerland O
, O
appeared O
at O
once O
in O
various O
parts O
of O
the O
heavens O
. O
The O
most O
violent O
storm O
hung O
exactly O
north O
of O
the O
town O
, O
over O
the O
part O
of O
the O
lake O
which O
lies O
between O
the O
promontory O
of O
Belrive O
and O
the O
village O
of O
Copêt O
. O
Another O
storm O
enlightened O
Jura O
with O
faint O
flashes O
; O
and O
another O
darkened O
and O
sometimes O
disclosed O
the O
Môle O
, O
a O
peaked O
mountain O
to O
the O
east O
of O
the O
lake O
. O
While O
I O
watched O
the O
tempest O
, O
so O
beautiful O
yet O
terrific O
, O
I O
wandered O
on O
with O
a O
hasty O
step O
. O
This O
noble O
war O
in O
the O
sky O
elevated O
my O
spirits O
; O
I O
clasped O
my O
hands O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
aloud O
, O
" O
William O
, O
dear O
angel O
! O
this O
is O
thy O
funeral O
, O
this O
thy O
dirge O
! O
" O
As O
I O
said O
these O
words O
, O
I O
perceived O
in O
the O
gloom O
a O
figure O
which O
stole O
from O
behind O
a O
clump O
of O
trees O
near O
me O
; O
I O
stood O
fixed O
, O
gazing O
intently O
: O
I O
could O
not O
be O
mistaken O
. O
A O
flash O
of O
lightning O
illuminated O
the O
object O
, O
and O
discovered O
its O
shape O
plainly O
to O
me O
; O
its O
gigantic O
stature O
, O
and O
the O
deformity O
of O
its O
aspect O
more O
hideous O
than O
belongs O
to O
humanity O
, O
instantly O
informed O
me O
that O
it O
was O
the O
wretch O
, O
the O
filthy O
dæmon O
, O
to O
whom O
I O
had O
given O
life O
. O
What O
did O
he O
there O
? O
Could O
he O
be O
( O
I O
shuddered O
at O
the O
conception O
) O
the O
murderer O
of O
my O
brother O
? O
No O
sooner O
did O
that O
idea O
cross O
my O
imagination O
, O
than O
I O
became O
convinced O
of O
its O
truth O
; O
my O
teeth O
chattered O
, O
and O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
lean O
against O
a O
tree O
for O
support O
. O
The O
figure O
passed O
me O
quickly O
, O
and O
I O
lost O
it O
in O
the O
gloom O
. O
Nothing O
in O
human O
shape O
could O
have O
destroyed O
the O
fair O
child O
. O
_He_ O
was O
the O
murderer O
! O
I O
could O
not O
doubt O
it O
. O
The O
mere O
presence O
of O
the O
idea O
was O
an O
irresistible O
proof O
of O
the O
fact O
. O
I O
thought O
of O
pursuing O
the O
devil O
; O
but O
it O
would O
have O
been O
in O
vain O
, O
for O
another O
flash O
discovered O
him O
to O
me O
hanging O
among O
the O
rocks O
of O
the O
nearly O
perpendicular O
ascent O
of O
Mont O
Salêve O
, O
a O
hill O
that O
bounds O
Plainpalais O
on O
the O
south O
. O
He O
soon O
reached O
the O
summit O
, O
and O
disappeared O
. O
I O
remained O
motionless O
. O
The O
thunder O
ceased O
; O
but O
the O
rain O
still O
continued O
, O
and O
the O
scene O
was O
enveloped O
in O
an O
impenetrable O
darkness O
. O
I O
revolved O
in O
my O
mind O
the O
events O
which O
I O
had O
until O
now O
sought O
to O
forget O
: O
the O
whole O
train O
of O
my O
progress O
toward O
the O
creation O
; O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
works O
of O
my O
own O
hands O
at O
my O
bedside O
; O
its O
departure O
. O
Two O
years O
had O
now O
nearly O
elapsed O
since O
the O
night O
on O
which O
he O
first O
received O
life O
; O
and O
was O
this O
his O
first O
crime O
? O
Alas O
! O
I O
had O
turned O
loose O
into O
the O
world O
a O
depraved O
wretch O
, O
whose O
delight O
was O
in O
carnage O
and O
misery O
; O
had O
he O
not O
murdered O
my O
brother O
? O
No O
one O
can O
conceive O
the O
anguish O
I O
suffered O
during O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
night O
, O
which O
I O
spent O
, O
cold O
and O
wet O
, O
in O
the O
open O
air O
. O
But O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
the O
inconvenience O
of O
the O
weather O
; O
my O
imagination O
was O
busy O
in O
scenes O
of O
evil O
and O
despair O
. O
I O
considered O
the O
being O
whom O
I O
had O
cast O
among O
mankind O
, O
and O
endowed O
with O
the O
will O
and O
power O
to O
effect O
purposes O
of O
horror O
, O
such O
as O
the O
deed O
which O
he O
had O
now O
done O
, O
nearly O
in O
the O
light O
of O
my O
own O
vampire O
, O
my O
own O
spirit O
let O
loose O
from O
the O
grave O
, O
and O
forced O
to O
destroy O
all O
that O
was O
dear O
to O
me O
. O
Day O
dawned O
; O
and O
I O
directed O
my O
steps O
towards O
the O
town O
. O
The O
gates O
were O
open O
, O
and O
I O
hastened O
to O
my O
father O
's O
house O
. O
My O
first O
thought O
was O
to O
discover O
what O
I O
knew O
of O
the O
murderer O
, O
and O
cause O
instant O
pursuit O
to O
be O
made O
. O
But O
I O
paused O
when O
I O
reflected O
on O
the O
story O
that O
I O
had O
to O
tell O
. O
A O
being O
whom O
I O
myself O
had O
formed O
, O
and O
endued O
with O
life O
, O
had O
met O
me O
at O
midnight O
among O
the O
precipices O
of O
an O
inaccessible O
mountain O
. O
I O
remembered O
also O
the O
nervous O
fever O
with O
which O
I O
had O
been O
seized O
just O
at O
the O
time O
that O
I O
dated O
my O
creation O
, O
and O
which O
would O
give O
an O
air O
of O
delirium O
to O
a O
tale O
otherwise O
so O
utterly O
improbable O
. O
I O
well O
knew O
that O
if O
any O
other O
had O
communicated O
such O
a O
relation O
to O
me O
, O
I O
should O
have O
looked O
upon O
it O
as O
the O
ravings O
of O
insanity O
. O
Besides O
, O
the O
strange O
nature O
of O
the O
animal O
would O
elude O
all O
pursuit O
, O
even O
if O
I O
were O
so O
far O
credited O
as O
to O
persuade O
my O
relatives O
to O
commence O
it O
. O
And O
then O
of O
what O
use O
would O
be O
pursuit O
? O
Who O
could O
arrest O
a O
creature O
capable O
of O
scaling O
the O
overhanging O
sides O
of O
Mont O
Salêve O
? O
These O
reflections O
determined O
me O
, O
and O
I O
resolved O
to O
remain O
silent O
. O
It O
was O
about O
five O
in O
the O
morning O
when O
I O
entered O
my O
father O
's O
house O
. O
I O
told O
the O
servants O
not O
to O
disturb O
the O
family O
, O
and O
went O
into O
the O
library O
to O
attend O
their O
usual O
hour O
of O
rising O
. O
Six O
years O
had O
elapsed O
, O
passed O
in O
a O
dream O
but O
for O
one O
indelible O
trace O
, O
and O
I O
stood O
in O
the O
same O
place O
where O
I O
had O
last O
embraced O
my O
father O
before O
my O
departure O
for O
Ingolstadt O
. O
Beloved O
and O
venerable O
parent O
! O
He O
still O
remained O
to O
me O
. O
I O
gazed O
on O
the O
picture O
of O
my O
mother O
, O
which O
stood O
over O
the O
mantel-piece O
. O
It O
was O
an O
historical O
subject O
, O
painted O
at O
my O
father O
's O
desire O
, O
and O
represented O
Caroline O
Beaufort O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
despair O
, O
kneeling O
by O
the O
coffin O
of O
her O
dead O
father O
. O
Her O
garb O
was O
rustic O
, O
and O
her O
cheek O
pale O
; O
but O
there O
was O
an O
air O
of O
dignity O
and O
beauty O
, O
that O
hardly O
permitted O
the O
sentiment O
of O
pity O
. O
Below O
this O
picture O
was O
a O
miniature O
of O
William O
; O
and O
my O
tears O
flowed O
when O
I O
looked O
upon O
it O
. O
While O
I O
was O
thus O
engaged O
, O
Ernest O
entered O
: O
he O
had O
heard O
me O
arrive O
, O
and O
hastened O
to O
welcome O
me O
: O
" O
Welcome O
, O
my O
dearest O
Victor O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
Ah O
! O
I O
wish O
you O
had O
come O
three O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
then O
you O
would O
have O
found O
us O
all O
joyous O
and O
delighted O
. O
You O
come O
to O
us O
now O
to O
share O
a O
misery O
which O
nothing O
can O
alleviate O
; O
yet O
your O
presence O
will O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
revive O
our O
father O
, O
who O
seems O
sinking O
under O
his O
misfortune O
; O
and O
your O
persuasions O
will O
induce O
poor O
Elizabeth O
to O
cease O
her O
vain O
and O
tormenting O
self-accusations.—Poor O
William O
! O
he O
was O
our O
darling O
and O
our O
pride O
! O
" O
Tears O
, O
unrestrained O
, O
fell O
from O
my O
brother O
's O
eyes O
; O
a O
sense O
of O
mortal O
agony O
crept O
over O
my O
frame O
. O
Before O
, O
I O
had O
only O
imagined O
the O
wretchedness O
of O
my O
desolated O
home O
; O
the O
reality O
came O
on O
me O
as O
a O
new O
, O
and O
a O
not O
less O
terrible O
, O
disaster O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
calm O
Ernest O
; O
I O
enquired O
more O
minutely O
concerning O
my O
father O
, O
and O
here O
I O
named O
my O
cousin O
. O
" O
She O
most O
of O
all O
, O
" O
said O
Ernest O
, O
" O
requires O
consolation O
; O
she O
accused O
herself O
of O
having O
caused O
the O
death O
of O
my O
brother O
, O
and O
that O
made O
her O
very O
wretched O
. O
But O
since O
the O
murderer O
has O
been O
discovered— O
" O
" O
The O
murderer O
discovered O
! O
Good O
God O
! O
how O
can O
that O
be O
? O
who O
could O
attempt O
to O
pursue O
him O
? O
It O
is O
impossible O
; O
one O
might O
as O
well O
try O
to O
overtake O
the O
winds O
, O
or O
confine O
a O
mountain-stream O
with O
a O
straw O
. O
I O
saw O
him O
too O
; O
he O
was O
free O
last O
night O
! O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
" O
replied O
my O
brother O
, O
in O
accents O
of O
wonder O
, O
" O
but O
to O
us O
the O
discovery O
we O
have O
made O
completes O
our O
misery O
. O
No O
one O
would O
believe O
it O
at O
first O
; O
and O
even O
now O
Elizabeth O
will O
not O
be O
convinced O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
the O
evidence O
. O
Indeed O
, O
who O
would O
credit O
that O
Justine O
Moritz O
, O
who O
was O
so O
amiable O
, O
and O
fond O
of O
all O
the O
family O
, O
could O
suddenly O
become O
so O
capable O
of O
so O
frightful O
, O
so O
appalling O
a O
crime O
? O
" O
" O
Justine O
Moritz O
! O
Poor O
, O
poor O
girl O
, O
is O
she O
the O
accused O
? O
But O
it O
is O
wrongfully O
; O
every O
one O
knows O
that O
; O
no O
one O
believes O
it O
, O
surely O
, O
Ernest O
? O
" O
" O
No O
one O
did O
at O
first O
; O
but O
several O
circumstances O
came O
out O
, O
that O
have O
almost O
forced O
conviction O
upon O
us O
; O
and O
her O
own O
behaviour O
has O
been O
so O
confused O
, O
as O
to O
add O
to O
the O
evidence O
of O
facts O
a O
weight O
that O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
leaves O
no O
hope O
for O
doubt O
. O
But O
she O
will O
be O
tried O
today O
, O
and O
you O
will O
then O
hear O
all O
. O
" O
He O
then O
related O
that O
, O
the O
morning O
on O
which O
the O
murder O
of O
poor O
William O
had O
been O
discovered O
, O
Justine O
had O
been O
taken O
ill O
, O
and O
confined O
to O
her O
bed O
for O
several O
days O
. O
During O
this O
interval O
, O
one O
of O
the O
servants O
, O
happening O
to O
examine O
the O
apparel O
she O
had O
worn O
on O
the O
night O
of O
the O
murder O
, O
had O
discovered O
in O
her O
pocket O
the O
picture O
of O
my O
mother O
, O
which O
had O
been O
judged O
to O
be O
the O
temptation O
of O
the O
murderer O
. O
The O
servant O
instantly O
showed O
it O
to O
one O
of O
the O
others O
, O
who O
, O
without O
saying O
a O
word O
to O
any O
of O
the O
family O
, O
went O
to O
a O
magistrate O
; O
and O
, O
upon O
their O
deposition O
, O
Justine O
was O
apprehended O
. O
On O
being O
charged O
with O
the O
fact O
, O
the O
poor O
girl O
confirmed O
the O
suspicion O
in O
a O
great O
measure O
by O
her O
extreme O
confusion O
of O
manner O
. O
This O
was O
a O
strange O
tale O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
shake O
my O
faith O
; O
and O
I O
replied O
earnestly O
, O
" O
You O
are O
all O
mistaken O
; O
I O
know O
the O
murderer O
. O
Justine O
, O
poor O
, O
good O
Justine O
, O
is O
innocent O
. O
" O
At O
that O
instant O
my O
father O
entered O
. O
I O
saw O
unhappiness O
deeply O
impressed O
on O
his O
countenance O
, O
but O
he O
endeavoured O
to O
welcome O
me O
cheerfully O
; O
and O
, O
after O
we O
had O
exchanged O
our O
mournful O
greeting O
, O
would O
have O
introduced O
some O
other O
topic O
than O
that O
of O
our O
disaster O
, O
had O
not O
Ernest O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Good O
God O
, O
papa O
! O
Victor O
says O
that O
he O
knows O
who O
was O
the O
murderer O
of O
poor O
William O
. O
" O
" O
We O
do O
also O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
" O
replied O
my O
father O
, O
" O
for O
indeed O
I O
had O
rather O
have O
been O
for O
ever O
ignorant O
than O
have O
discovered O
so O
much O
depravity O
and O
ungratitude O
in O
one O
I O
valued O
so O
highly O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
father O
, O
you O
are O
mistaken O
; O
Justine O
is O
innocent O
. O
" O
" O
If O
she O
is O
, O
God O
forbid O
that O
she O
should O
suffer O
as O
guilty O
. O
She O
is O
to O
be O
tried O
today O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
, O
I O
sincerely O
hope O
, O
that O
she O
will O
be O
acquitted O
. O
" O
This O
speech O
calmed O
me O
. O
I O
was O
firmly O
convinced O
in O
my O
own O
mind O
that O
Justine O
, O
and O
indeed O
every O
human O
being O
, O
was O
guiltless O
of O
this O
murder O
. O
I O
had O
no O
fear O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
any O
circumstantial O
evidence O
could O
be O
brought O
forward O
strong O
enough O
to O
convict O
her O
. O
My O
tale O
was O
not O
one O
to O
announce O
publicly O
; O
its O
astounding O
horror O
would O
be O
looked O
upon O
as O
madness O
by O
the O
vulgar O
. O
Did O
any O
one O
indeed O
exist O
, O
except O
I O
, O
the O
creator O
, O
who O
would O
believe O
, O
unless O
his O
senses O
convinced O
him O
, O
in O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
living O
monument O
of O
presumption O
and O
rash O
ignorance O
which O
I O
had O
let O
loose O
upon O
the O
world O
? O
We O
were O
soon O
joined O
by O
Elizabeth O
. O
Time O
had O
altered O
her O
since O
I O
last O
beheld O
her O
; O
it O
had O
endowed O
her O
with O
loveliness O
surpassing O
the O
beauty O
of O
her O
childish O
years O
. O
There O
was O
the O
same O
candour O
, O
the O
same O
vivacity O
, O
but O
it O
was O
allied O
to O
an O
expression O
more O
full O
of O
sensibility O
and O
intellect O
. O
She O
welcomed O
me O
with O
the O
greatest O
affection O
. O
" O
Your O
arrival O
, O
my O
dear O
cousin O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
fills O
me O
with O
hope O
. O
You O
perhaps O
will O
find O
some O
means O
to O
justify O
my O
poor O
guiltless O
Justine O
. O
Alas O
! O
who O
is O
safe O
, O
if O
she O
be O
convicted O
of O
crime O
? O
I O
rely O
on O
her O
innocence O
as O
certainly O
as O
I O
do O
upon O
my O
own O
. O
Our O
misfortune O
is O
doubly O
hard O
to O
us O
; O
we O
have O
not O
only O
lost O
that O
lovely O
darling O
boy O
, O
but O
this O
poor O
girl O
, O
whom O
I O
sincerely O
love O
, O
is O
to O
be O
torn O
away O
by O
even O
a O
worse O
fate O
. O
If O
she O
is O
condemned O
, O
I O
never O
shall O
know O
joy O
