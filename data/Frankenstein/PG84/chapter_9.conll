It O
was O
on O
a O
dreary O
night O
of O
November O
that O
I O
beheld O
the O
accomplishment O
of O
my O
toils O
. O
With O
an O
anxiety O
that O
almost O
amounted O
to O
agony O
, O
I O
collected O
the O
instruments O
of O
life O
around O
me O
, O
that O
I O
might O
infuse O
a O
spark O
of O
being O
into O
the O
lifeless O
thing O
that O
lay O
at O
my O
feet O
. O
It O
was O
already O
one O
in O
the O
morning O
; O
the O
rain O
pattered O
dismally O
against O
the O
panes O
, O
and O
my O
candle O
was O
nearly O
burnt O
out O
, O
when O
, O
by O
the O
glimmer O
of O
the O
half-extinguished O
light O
, O
I O
saw O
the O
dull O
yellow O
eye O
of O
the O
creature O
open O
; O
it O
breathed O
hard O
, O
and O
a O
convulsive O
motion O
agitated O
its O
limbs O
. O
How O
can O
I O
describe O
my O
emotions O
at O
this O
catastrophe O
, O
or O
how O
delineate O
the O
wretch O
whom O
with O
such O
infinite O
pains O
and O
care O
I O
had O
endeavoured O
to O
form O
? O
His O
limbs O
were O
in O
proportion O
, O
and O
I O
had O
selected O
his O
features O
as O
beautiful O
. O
Beautiful O
! O
Great O
God O
! O
His O
yellow O
skin O
scarcely O
covered O
the O
work O
of O
muscles O
and O
arteries O
beneath O
; O
his O
hair O
was O
of O
a O
lustrous O
black O
, O
and O
flowing O
; O
his O
teeth O
of O
a O
pearly O
whiteness O
; O
but O
these O
luxuriances O
only O
formed O
a O
more O
horrid O
contrast O
with O
his O
watery O
eyes O
, O
that O
seemed O
almost O
of O
the O
same O
colour O
as O
the O
dun-white O
sockets O
in O
which O
they O
were O
set O
, O
his O
shrivelled O
complexion O
and O
straight O
black O
lips O
. O
The O
different O
accidents O
of O
life O
are O
not O
so O
changeable O
as O
the O
feelings O
of O
human O
nature O
. O
I O
had O
worked O
hard O
for O
nearly O
two O
years O
, O
for O
the O
sole O
purpose O
of O
infusing O
life O
into O
an O
inanimate O
body O
. O
For O
this O
I O
had O
deprived O
myself O
of O
rest O
and O
health O
. O
I O
had O
desired O
it O
with O
an O
ardour O
that O
far O
exceeded O
moderation O
; O
but O
now O
that O
I O
had O
finished O
, O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
dream O
vanished O
, O
and O
breathless O
horror O
and O
disgust O
filled O
my O
heart O
. O
Unable O
to O
endure O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
being O
I O
had O
created O
, O
I O
rushed O
out O
of O
the O
room O
and O
continued O
a O
long O
time O
traversing O
my O
bed-chamber O
, O
unable O
to O
compose O
my O
mind O
to O
sleep O
. O
At O
length O
lassitude O
succeeded O
to O
the O
tumult O
I O
had O
before O
endured O
, O
and O
I O
threw O
myself O
on O
the O
bed O
in O
my O
clothes O
, O
endeavouring O
to O
seek O
a O
few O
moments O
of O
forgetfulness O
. O
But O
it O
was O
in O
vain O
; O
I O
slept O
, O
indeed O
, O
but O
I O
was O
disturbed O
by O
the O
wildest O
dreams O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
saw O
Elizabeth O
, O
in O
the O
bloom O
of O
health O
, O
walking O
in O
the O
streets O
of O
Ingolstadt O
. O
Delighted O
and O
surprised O
, O
I O
embraced O
her O
, O
but O
as O
I O
imprinted O
the O
first O
kiss O
on O
her O
lips O
, O
they O
became O
livid O
with O
the O
hue O
of O
death O
; O
her O
features O
appeared O
to O
change O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
that O
I O
held O
the O
corpse O
of O
my O
dead O
mother O
in O
my O
arms O
; O
a O
shroud O
enveloped O
her O
form O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
grave-worms O
crawling O
in O
the O
folds O
of O
the O
flannel O
. O
I O
started O
from O
my O
sleep O
with O
horror O
; O
a O
cold O
dew O
covered O
my O
forehead O
, O
my O
teeth O
chattered O
, O
and O
every O
limb O
became O
convulsed O
; O
when O
, O
by O
the O
dim O
and O
yellow O
light O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
as O
it O
forced O
its O
way O
through O
the O
window O
shutters O
, O
I O
beheld O
the O
wretchâ€”the O
miserable O
monster O
whom O
I O
had O
created O
. O
He O
held O
up O
the O
curtain O
of O
the O
bed O
; O
and O
his O
eyes O
, O
if O
eyes O
they O
may O
be O
called O
, O
were O
fixed O
on O
me O
. O
His O
jaws O
opened O
, O
and O
he O
muttered O
some O
inarticulate O
sounds O
, O
while O
a O
grin O
wrinkled O
his O
cheeks O
. O
He O
might O
have O
spoken O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
hear O
; O
one O
hand O
was O
stretched O
out O
, O
seemingly O
to O
detain O
me O
, O
but O
I O
escaped O
and O
rushed O
downstairs O
. O
I O
took O
refuge O
in O
the O
courtyard O
belonging O
to O
the O
house O
which O
I O
inhabited O
, O
where O
I O
remained O
during O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
, O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
in O
the O
greatest O
agitation O
, O
listening O
attentively O
, O
catching O
and O
fearing O
each O
sound O
as O
if O
it O
were O
to O
announce O
the O
approach O
of O
the O
demoniacal O
corpse O
to O
which O
I O
had O
so O
miserably O
given O
life O
. O
Oh O
! O
No O
mortal O
could O
support O
the O
horror O
of O
that O
countenance O
. O
A O
mummy O
again O
endued O
with O
animation O
could O
not O
be O
so O
hideous O
as O
that O
wretch O
. O
I O
had O
gazed O
on O
him O
while O
unfinished O
; O
he O
was O
ugly O
then O
, O
but O
when O
those O
muscles O
and O
joints O
were O
rendered O
capable O
of O
motion O
, O
it O
became O
a O
thing O
such O
as O
even O
Dante O
could O
not O
have O
conceived O
. O
I O
passed O
the O
night O
wretchedly O
. O
Sometimes O
my O
pulse O
beat O
so O
quickly O
and O
hardly O
that O
I O
felt O
the O
palpitation O
of O
every O
artery O
; O
at O
others O
, O
I O
nearly O
sank O
to O
the O
ground O
through O
languor O
and O
extreme O
weakness O
. O
Mingled O
with O
this O
horror O
, O
I O
felt O
the O
bitterness O
of O
disappointment O
; O
dreams O
that O
had O
been O
my O
food O
and O
pleasant O
rest O
for O
so O
long O
a O
space O
were O
now O
become O
a O
hell O
to O
me O
; O
and O
the O
change O
was O
so O
rapid O
, O
the O
overthrow O
so O
complete O
! O
Morning O
, O
dismal O
and O
wet O
, O
at O
length O
dawned O
and O
discovered O
to O
my O
sleepless O
and O
aching O
eyes O
the O
church O
of O
Ingolstadt O
, O
its O
white O
steeple O
and O
clock O
, O
which O
indicated O
the O
sixth O
hour O
. O
The O
porter O
opened O
the O
gates O
of O
the O
court O
, O
which O
had O
that O
night O
been O
my O
asylum O
, O
and O
I O
issued O
into O
the O
streets O
, O
pacing O
them O
with O
quick O
steps O
, O
as O
if O
I O
sought O
to O
avoid O
the O
wretch O
whom O
I O
feared O
every O
turning O
of O
the O
street O
would O
present O
to O
my O
view O
. O
I O
did O
not O
dare O
return O
to O
the O
apartment O
which O
I O
inhabited O
, O
but O
felt O
impelled O
to O
hurry O
on O
, O
although O
drenched O
by O
the O
rain O
which O
poured O
from O
a O
black O
and O
comfortless O
sky O
. O
I O
continued O
walking O
in O
this O
manner O
for O
some O
time O
, O
endeavouring O
by O
bodily O
exercise O
to O
ease O
the O
load O
that O
weighed O
upon O
my O
mind O
. O
I O
traversed O
the O
streets O
without O
any O
clear O
conception O
of O
where O
I O
was O
or O
what O
I O
was O
doing O
. O
My O
heart O
palpitated O
in O
the O
sickness O
of O
fear O
, O
and O
I O
hurried O
on O
with O
irregular O
steps O
, O
not O
daring O
to O
look O
about O
me O
: O
Like O
one O
who O
, O
on O
a O
lonely O
road O
, O
Doth O
walk O
in O
fear O
and O
dread O
, O
And O
, O
having O
once O
turned O
round O
, O
walks O
on O
, O
And O
turns O
no O
more O
his O
head O
; O
Because O
he O
knows O
a O
frightful O
fiend O
Doth O
close O
behind O
him O
tread O
. O
[ O
Coleridge O
's O
" O
Ancient O
Mariner O
. O
" O
] O
Continuing O
thus O
, O
I O
came O
at O
length O
opposite O
to O
the O
inn O
at O
which O
the O
various O
diligences O
and O
carriages O
usually O
stopped O
. O
Here O
I O
paused O
, O
I O
knew O
not O
why O
; O
but O
I O
remained O
some O
minutes O
with O
my O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
a O
coach O
that O
was O
coming O
towards O
me O
from O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
street O
. O
As O
it O
drew O
nearer O
I O
observed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
Swiss O
diligence O
; O
it O
stopped O
just O
where O
I O
was O
standing O
, O
and O
on O
the O
door O
being O
opened O
, O
I O
perceived O
Henry O
Clerval O
, O
who O
, O
on O
seeing O
me O
, O
instantly O
sprung O
out O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Frankenstein O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
he O
, O
" O
how O
glad O
I O
am O
to O
see O
you O
! O
How O
fortunate O
that O
you O
should O
be O
here O
at O
the O
very O
moment O
of O
my O
alighting O
! O
" O
Nothing O
could O
equal O
my O
delight O
on O
seeing O
Clerval O
; O
his O
presence O
brought O
back O
to O
my O
thoughts O
my O
father O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
all O
those O
scenes O
of O
home O
so O
dear O
to O
my O
recollection O
. O
I O
grasped O
his O
hand O
, O
and O
in O
a O
moment O
forgot O
my O
horror O
and O
misfortune O
; O
I O
felt O
suddenly O
, O
and O
for O
the O
first O
time O
during O
many O
months O
, O
calm O
and O
serene O
joy O
. O
I O
welcomed O
my O
friend O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
the O
most O
cordial O
manner O
, O
and O
we O
walked O
towards O
my O
college O
. O
Clerval O
continued O
talking O
for O
some O
time O
about O
our O
mutual O
friends O
and O
his O
own O
good O
fortune O
in O
being O
permitted O
to O
come O
to O
Ingolstadt O
. O
" O
You O
may O
easily O
believe O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
how O
great O
was O
the O
difficulty O
to O
persuade O
my O
father O
that O
all O
necessary O
knowledge O
was O
not O
comprised O
in O
the O
noble O
art O
of O
book-keeping O
; O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
believe O
I O
left O
him O
incredulous O
to O
the O
last O
, O
for O
his O
constant O
answer O
to O
my O
unwearied O
entreaties O
was O
the O
same O
as O
that O
of O
the O
Dutch O
schoolmaster O
in O
The O
Vicar O
of O
Wakefield O
: O
' O
I O
have O
ten O
thousand O
florins O
a O
year O
without O
Greek O
, O
I O
eat O
heartily O
without O
Greek O
. O
' O
But O
his O
affection O
for O
me O
at O
length O
overcame O
his O
dislike O
of O
learning O
, O
and O
he O
has O
permitted O
me O
to O
undertake O
a O
voyage O
of O
discovery O
to O
the O
land O
of O
knowledge O
. O
" O
" O
It O
gives O
me O
the O
greatest O
delight O
to O
see O
you O
; O
but O
tell O
me O
how O
you O
left O
my O
father O
, O
brothers O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
. O
" O
" O
Very O
well O
, O
and O
very O
happy O
, O
only O
a O
little O
uneasy O
that O
they O
hear O
from O
you O
so O
seldom O
. O
By O
the O
by O
, O
I O
mean O
to O
lecture O
you O
a O
little O
upon O
their O
account O
myself O
. O
But O
, O
my O
dear O
Frankenstein O
, O
" O
continued O
he O
, O
stopping O
short O
and O
gazing O
full O
in O
my O
face O
, O
" O
I O
did O
not O
before O
remark O
how O
very O
ill O
you O
appear O
; O
so O
thin O
and O
pale O
; O
you O
look O
as O
if O
you O
had O
been O
watching O
for O
several O
nights O
. O
" O
" O
You O
have O
guessed O
right O
; O
I O
have O
lately O
been O
so O
deeply O
engaged O
in O
one O
occupation O
that O
I O
have O
not O
allowed O
myself O
sufficient O
rest O
, O
as O
you O
see O
; O
but O
I O
hope O
, O
I O
sincerely O
hope O
, O
that O
all O
these O
employments O
are O
now O
at O
an O
end O
and O
that O
I O
am O
at O
length O
free O
. O
" O
I O
trembled O
excessively O
; O
I O
could O
not O
endure O
to O
think O
of O
, O
and O
far O
less O
to O
allude O
to O
, O
the O
occurrences O
of O
the O
preceding O
night O
. O
I O
walked O
with O
a O
quick O
pace O
, O
and O
we O
soon O
arrived O
at O
my O
college O
. O
I O
then O
reflected O
, O
and O
the O
thought O
made O
me O
shiver O
, O
that O
the O
creature O
whom O
I O
had O
left O
in O
my O
apartment O
might O
still O
be O
there O
, O
alive O
and O
walking O
about O
. O
I O
dreaded O
to O
behold O
this O
monster O
, O
but O
I O
feared O
still O
more O
that O
Henry O
should O
see O
him O
. O
Entreating O
him O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
remain O
a O
few O
minutes O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
stairs O
, O
I O
darted O
up O
towards O
my O
own O
room O
. O
My O
hand O
was O
already O
on O
the O
lock O
of O
the O
door O
before O
I O
recollected O
myself O
. O
I O
then O
paused O
, O
and O
a O
cold O
shivering O
came O
over O
me O
. O
I O
threw O
the O
door O
forcibly O
open O
, O
as O
children O
are O
accustomed O
to O
do O
when O
they O
expect O
a O
spectre O
to O
stand O
in O
waiting O
for O
them O
on O
the O
other O
side O
; O
but O
nothing O
appeared O
. O
I O
stepped O
fearfully O
in O
: O
the O
apartment O
was O
empty O
, O
and O
my O
bedroom O
was O
also O
freed O
from O
its O
hideous O
guest O
. O
I O
could O
hardly O
believe O
that O
so O
great O
a O
good O
fortune O
could O
have O
befallen O
me O
, O
but O
when O
I O
became O
assured O
that O
my O
enemy O
had O
indeed O
fled O
, O
I O
clapped O
my O
hands O
for O
joy O
and O
ran O
down O
to O
Clerval O
. O
We O
ascended O
into O
my O
room O
, O
and O
the O
servant O
presently O
brought O
breakfast O
; O
but O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
contain O
myself O
. O
It O
was O
not O
joy O
only O
that O
possessed O
me O
; O
I O
felt O
my O
flesh O
tingle O
with O
excess O
of O
sensitiveness O
, O
and O
my O
pulse O
beat O
rapidly O
. O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
remain O
for O
a O
single O
instant O
in O
the O
same O
place O
; O
I O
jumped O
over O
the O
chairs O
, O
clapped O
my O
hands O
, O
and O
laughed O
aloud O
. O
Clerval O
at O
first O
attributed O
my O
unusual O
spirits O
to O
joy O
on O
his O
arrival O
, O
but O
when O
he O
observed O
me O
more O
attentively O
, O
he O
saw O
a O
wildness O
in O
my O
eyes O
for O
which O
he O
could O
not O
account O
, O
and O
my O
loud O
, O
unrestrained O
, O
heartless O
laughter O
frightened O
and O
astonished O
him O
. O
" O
My O
dear O
Victor O
, O
" O
cried O
he O
, O
" O
what O
, O
for O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
is O
the O
matter O
? O
Do O
not O
laugh O
in O
that O
manner O
. O
How O
ill O
you O
are O
! O
What O
is O
the O
cause O
of O
all O
this O
? O
" O
" O
Do O
not O
ask O
me O
, O
" O
cried O
I O
, O
putting O
my O
hands O
before O
my O
eyes O
, O
for O
I O
thought O
I O
saw O
the O
dreaded O
spectre O
glide O
into O
the O
room O
; O
" O
_he_ O
can O
tell O
. O
Oh O
, O
save O
me O
! O
Save O
me O
! O
" O
I O
imagined O
that O
the O
monster O
seized O
me O
; O
I O
struggled O
furiously O
and O
fell O
down O
in O
a O
fit O
. O
Poor O
Clerval O
! O
What O
must O
have O
been O
his O
feelings O
? O
A O
meeting O
, O
which O
he O
anticipated O
with O
such O
joy O
, O
so O
strangely O
turned O
to O
bitterness O
. O
But O
I O
was O
not O
the O
witness O
of O
his O
grief O
, O
for O
I O
was O
lifeless O
and O
did O
not O
recover O
my O
senses O
for O
a O
long O
, O
long O
time O
. O
This O
was O
the O
commencement O
of O
a O
nervous O
fever O
which O
confined O
me O
for O
several O
months O
. O
During O
all O
that O
time O
Henry O
was O
my O
only O
nurse O
. O
I O
afterwards O
learned O
that O
, O
knowing O
my O
father O
's O
advanced O
age O
and O
unfitness O
for O
so O
long O
a O
journey O
, O
and O
how O
wretched O
my O
sickness O
would O
make O
Elizabeth O
, O
he O
spared O
them O
this O
grief O
by O
concealing O
the O
extent O
of O
my O
disorder O
. O
He O
knew O
that O
I O
could O
not O
have O
a O
more O
kind O
and O
attentive O
nurse O
than O
himself O
; O
and O
, O
firm O
in O
the O
hope O
he O
felt O
of O
my O
recovery O
, O
he O
did O
not O
doubt O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
doing O
harm O
, O
he O
performed O
the O
kindest O
action O
that O
he O
could O
towards O
them O
. O
But O
I O
was O
in O
reality O
very O
ill O
, O
and O
surely O
nothing O
but O
the O
unbounded O
and O
unremitting O
attentions O
of O
my O
friend O
could O
have O
restored O
me O
to O
life O
. O
The O
form O
of O
the O
monster O
on O
whom O
I O
had O
bestowed O
existence O
was O
for O
ever O
before O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
I O
raved O
incessantly O
concerning O
him O
. O
Doubtless O
my O
words O
surprised O
Henry O
; O
he O
at O
first O
believed O
them O
to O
be O
the O
wanderings O
of O
my O
disturbed O
imagination O
, O
but O
the O
pertinacity O
with O
which O
I O
continually O
recurred O
to O
the O
same O
subject O
persuaded O
him O
that O
my O
disorder O
indeed O
owed O
its O
origin O
to O
some O
uncommon O
and O
terrible O
event O
. O
By O
very O
slow O
degrees O
, O
and O
with O
frequent O
relapses O
that O
alarmed O
and O
grieved O
my O
friend O
, O
I O
recovered O
. O
I O
remember O
the O
first O
time O
I O
became O
capable O
of O
observing O
outward O
objects O
with O
any O
kind O
of O
pleasure O
, O
I O
perceived O
that O
the O
fallen O
leaves O
had O
disappeared O
and O
that O
the O
young O
buds O
were O
shooting O
forth O
from O
the O
trees O
that O
shaded O
my O
window O
. O
It O
was O
a O
divine O
spring O
, O
and O
the O
season O
contributed O
greatly O
to O
my O
convalescence O
. O
I O
felt O
also O
sentiments O
of O
joy O
and O
affection O
revive O
in O
my O
bosom O
; O
my O
gloom O
disappeared O
, O
and O
in O
a O
short O
time O
I O
became O
as O
cheerful O
as O
before O
I O
was O
attacked O
by O
the O
fatal O
passion O
. O
" O
Dearest O
Clerval O
, O
" O
exclaimed O
I O
, O
" O
how O
kind O
, O
how O
very O
good O
you O
are O
to O
me O
. O
This O
whole O
winter O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
spent O
in O
study O
, O
as O
you O
promised O
yourself O
, O
has O
been O
consumed O
in O
my O
sick O
room O
. O
How O
shall O
I O
ever O
repay O
you O
? O
I O
feel O
the O
greatest O
remorse O
for O
the O
disappointment O
of O
which O
I O
have O
been O
the O
occasion O
, O
but O
you O
will O
forgive O
me O
. O
" O
" O
You O
will O
repay O
me O
entirely O
if O
you O
do O
not O
discompose O
yourself O
, O
but O
get O
well O
as O
fast O
as O
you O
can O
; O
and O
since O
you O
appear O
in O
such O
good O
spirits O
, O
I O
may O
speak O
to O
you O
on O
one O
subject O
, O
may O
I O
not O
? O
" O
I O
trembled O
. O
One O
subject O
! O
What O
could O
it O
be O
? O
Could O
he O
allude O
to O
an O
object O
on O
whom O
I O
dared O
not O
even O
think O
? O
" O
Compose O
yourself O
, O
" O
said O
Clerval O
, O
who O
observed O
my O
change O
of O
colour O
, O
" O
I O
will O
not O
mention O
it O
if O
it O
agitates O
you O
; O
but O
your O
father O
and O
cousin O
would O
be O
very O
happy O
if O
they O
received O
a O
letter O
from O
you O
in O
your O
own O
handwriting O
. O
They O
hardly O
know O
how O
ill O
you O
have O
been O
and O
are O
uneasy O
at O
your O
long O
silence O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
that O
all O
, O
my O
dear O
Henry O
? O
How O
could O
you O
suppose O
that O
my O
first O
thought O
would O
not O
fly O
towards O
those O
dear O
, O
dear O
friends O
whom O
I O
love O
and O
who O
are O
so O
deserving O
of O
my O
love O
? O
" O
" O
If O
this O
is O
your O
present O
temper O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
you O
will O
perhaps O
be O
glad O
to O
see O
a O
letter O
that O
has O
been O
lying O
here O
some O
days O
for O
you O
; O
it O
is O
from O
your O
cousin O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
