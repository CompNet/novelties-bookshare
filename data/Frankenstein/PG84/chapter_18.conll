" O
Some O
time O
elapsed O
before O
I O
learned O
the O
history O
of O
my O
friends O
. O
It O
was O
one O
which O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
impress O
itself O
deeply O
on O
my O
mind O
, O
unfolding O
as O
it O
did O
a O
number O
of O
circumstances O
, O
each O
interesting O
and O
wonderful O
to O
one O
so O
utterly O
inexperienced O
as O
I O
was O
. O
" O
The O
name O
of O
the O
old O
man O
was O
De O
Lacey O
. O
He O
was O
descended O
from O
a O
good O
family O
in O
France O
, O
where O
he O
had O
lived O
for O
many O
years O
in O
affluence O
, O
respected O
by O
his O
superiors O
and O
beloved O
by O
his O
equals O
. O
His O
son O
was O
bred O
in O
the O
service O
of O
his O
country O
, O
and O
Agatha O
had O
ranked O
with O
ladies O
of O
the O
highest O
distinction O
. O
A O
few O
months O
before O
my O
arrival O
they O
had O
lived O
in O
a O
large O
and O
luxurious O
city O
called O
Paris O
, O
surrounded O
by O
friends O
and O
possessed O
of O
every O
enjoyment O
which O
virtue O
, O
refinement O
of O
intellect O
, O
or O
taste O
, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
moderate O
fortune O
, O
could O
afford O
. O
" O
The O
father O
of O
Safie O
had O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
their O
ruin O
. O
He O
was O
a O
Turkish O
merchant O
and O
had O
inhabited O
Paris O
for O
many O
years O
, O
when O
, O
for O
some O
reason O
which O
I O
could O
not O
learn O
, O
he O
became O
obnoxious O
to O
the O
government O
. O
He O
was O
seized O
and O
cast O
into O
prison O
the O
very O
day O
that O
Safie O
arrived O
from O
Constantinople O
to O
join O
him O
. O
He O
was O
tried O
and O
condemned O
to O
death O
. O
The O
injustice O
of O
his O
sentence O
was O
very O
flagrant O
; O
all O
Paris O
was O
indignant O
; O
and O
it O
was O
judged O
that O
his O
religion O
and O
wealth O
rather O
than O
the O
crime O
alleged O
against O
him O
had O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
condemnation O
. O
" O
Felix O
had O
accidentally O
been O
present O
at O
the O
trial O
; O
his O
horror O
and O
indignation O
were O
uncontrollable O
when O
he O
heard O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
court O
. O
He O
made O
, O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
a O
solemn O
vow O
to O
deliver O
him O
and O
then O
looked O
around O
for O
the O
means O
. O
After O
many O
fruitless O
attempts O
to O
gain O
admittance O
to O
the O
prison O
, O
he O
found O
a O
strongly O
grated O
window O
in O
an O
unguarded O
part O
of O
the O
building O
, O
which O
lighted O
the O
dungeon O
of O
the O
unfortunate O
Muhammadan O
, O
who O
, O
loaded O
with O
chains O
, O
waited O
in O
despair O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
barbarous O
sentence O
. O
Felix O
visited O
the O
grate O
at O
night O
and O
made O
known O
to O
the O
prisoner O
his O
intentions O
in O
his O
favour O
. O
The O
Turk O
, O
amazed O
and O
delighted O
, O
endeavoured O
to O
kindle O
the O
zeal O
of O
his O
deliverer O
by O
promises O
of O
reward O
and O
wealth O
. O
Felix O
rejected O
his O
offers O
with O
contempt O
, O
yet O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
lovely O
Safie O
, O
who O
was O
allowed O
to O
visit O
her O
father O
and O
who O
by O
her O
gestures O
expressed O
her O
lively O
gratitude O
, O
the O
youth O
could O
not O
help O
owning O
to O
his O
own O
mind O
that O
the O
captive O
possessed O
a O
treasure O
which O
would O
fully O
reward O
his O
toil O
and O
hazard O
. O
" O
The O
Turk O
quickly O
perceived O
the O
impression O
that O
his O
daughter O
had O
made O
on O
the O
heart O
of O
Felix O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
secure O
him O
more O
entirely O
in O
his O
interests O
by O
the O
promise O
of O
her O
hand O
in O
marriage O
so O
soon O
as O
he O
should O
be O
conveyed O
to O
a O
place O
of O
safety O
. O
Felix O
was O
too O
delicate O
to O
accept O
this O
offer O
, O
yet O
he O
looked O
forward O
to O
the O
probability O
of O
the O
event O
as O
to O
the O
consummation O
of O
his O
happiness O
. O
" O
During O
the O
ensuing O
days O
, O
while O
the O
preparations O
were O
going O
forward O
for O
the O
escape O
of O
the O
merchant O
, O
the O
zeal O
of O
Felix O
was O
warmed O
by O
several O
letters O
that O
he O
received O
from O
this O
lovely O
girl O
, O
who O
found O
means O
to O
express O
her O
thoughts O
in O
the O
language O
of O
her O
lover O
by O
the O
aid O
of O
an O
old O
man O
, O
a O
servant O
of O
her O
father O
who O
understood O
French O
. O
She O
thanked O
him O
in O
the O
most O
ardent O
terms O
for O
his O
intended O
services O
towards O
her O
parent O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
she O
gently O
deplored O
her O
own O
fate O
. O
" O
I O
have O
copies O
of O
these O
letters O
, O
for O
I O
found O
means O
, O
during O
my O
residence O
in O
the O
hovel O
, O
to O
procure O
the O
implements O
of O
writing O
; O
and O
the O
letters O
were O
often O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Felix O
or O
Agatha O
. O
Before O
I O
depart O
I O
will O
give O
them O
to O
you O
; O
they O
will O
prove O
the O
truth O
of O
my O
tale O
; O
but O
at O
present O
, O
as O
the O
sun O
is O
already O
far O
declined O
, O
I O
shall O
only O
have O
time O
to O
repeat O
the O
substance O
of O
them O
to O
you O
. O
" O
Safie O
related O
that O
her O
mother O
was O
a O
Christian O
Arab O
, O
seized O
and O
made O
a O
slave O
by O
the O
Turks O
; O
recommended O
by O
her O
beauty O
, O
she O
had O
won O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
father O
of O
Safie O
, O
who O
married O
her O
. O
The O
young O
girl O
spoke O
in O
high O
and O
enthusiastic O
terms O
of O
her O
mother O
, O
who O
, O
born O
in O
freedom O
, O
spurned O
the O
bondage O
to O
which O
she O
was O
now O
reduced O
. O
She O
instructed O
her O
daughter O
in O
the O
tenets O
of O
her O
religion O
and O
taught O
her O
to O
aspire O
to O
higher O
powers O
of O
intellect O
and O
an O
independence O
of O
spirit O
forbidden O
to O
the O
female O
followers O
of O
Muhammad O
. O
This O
lady O
died O
, O
but O
her O
lessons O
were O
indelibly O
impressed O
on O
the O
mind O
of O
Safie O
, O
who O
sickened O
at O
the O
prospect O
of O
again O
returning O
to O
Asia O
and O
being O
immured O
within O
the O
walls O
of O
a O
harem O
, O
allowed O
only O
to O
occupy O
herself O
with O
infantile O
amusements O
, O
ill-suited O
to O
the O
temper O
of O
her O
soul O
, O
now O
accustomed O
to O
grand O
ideas O
and O
a O
noble O
emulation O
for O
virtue O
. O
The O
prospect O
of O
marrying O
a O
Christian O
and O
remaining O
in O
a O
country O
where O
women O
were O
allowed O
to O
take O
a O
rank O
in O
society O
was O
enchanting O
to O
her O
. O
" O
The O
day O
for O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
Turk O
was O
fixed O
, O
but O
on O
the O
night O
previous O
to O
it O
he O
quitted O
his O
prison O
and O
before O
morning O
was O
distant O
many O
leagues O
from O
Paris O
. O
Felix O
had O
procured O
passports O
in O
the O
name O
of O
his O
father O
, O
sister O
, O
and O
himself O
. O
He O
had O
previously O
communicated O
his O
plan O
to O
the O
former O
, O
who O
aided O
the O
deceit O
by O
quitting O
his O
house O
, O
under O
the O
pretence O
of O
a O
journey O
and O
concealed O
himself O
, O
with O
his O
daughter O
, O
in O
an O
obscure O
part O
of O
Paris O
. O
" O
Felix O
conducted O
the O
fugitives O
through O
France O
to O
Lyons O
and O
across O
Mont O
Cenis O
to O
Leghorn O
, O
where O
the O
merchant O
had O
decided O
to O
wait O
a O
favourable O
opportunity O
of O
passing O
into O
some O
part O
of O
the O
Turkish O
dominions O
. O
" O
Safie O
resolved O
to O
remain O
with O
her O
father O
until O
the O
moment O
of O
his O
departure O
, O
before O
which O
time O
the O
Turk O
renewed O
his O
promise O
that O
she O
should O
be O
united O
to O
his O
deliverer O
; O
and O
Felix O
remained O
with O
them O
in O
expectation O
of O
that O
event O
; O
and O
in O
the O
meantime O
he O
enjoyed O
the O
society O
of O
the O
Arabian O
, O
who O
exhibited O
towards O
him O
the O
simplest O
and O
tenderest O
affection O
. O
They O
conversed O
with O
one O
another O
through O
the O
means O
of O
an O
interpreter O
, O
and O
sometimes O
with O
the O
interpretation O
of O
looks O
; O
and O
Safie O
sang O
to O
him O
the O
divine O
airs O
of O
her O
native O
country O
. O
" O
The O
Turk O
allowed O
this O
intimacy O
to O
take O
place O
and O
encouraged O
the O
hopes O
of O
the O
youthful O
lovers O
, O
while O
in O
his O
heart O
he O
had O
formed O
far O
other O
plans O
. O
He O
loathed O
the O
idea O
that O
his O
daughter O
should O
be O
united O
to O
a O
Christian O
, O
but O
he O
feared O
the O
resentment O
of O
Felix O
if O
he O
should O
appear O
lukewarm O
, O
for O
he O
knew O
that O
he O
was O
still O
in O
the O
power O
of O
his O
deliverer O
if O
he O
should O
choose O
to O
betray O
him O
to O
the O
Italian O
state O
which O
they O
inhabited O
. O
He O
revolved O
a O
thousand O
plans O
by O
which O
he O
should O
be O
enabled O
to O
prolong O
the O
deceit O
until O
it O
might O
be O
no O
longer O
necessary O
, O
and O
secretly O
to O
take O
his O
daughter O
with O
him O
when O
he O
departed O
. O
His O
plans O
were O
facilitated O
by O
the O
news O
which O
arrived O
from O
Paris O
. O
" O
The O
government O
of O
France O
were O
greatly O
enraged O
at O
the O
escape O
of O
their O
victim O
and O
spared O
no O
pains O
to O
detect O
and O
punish O
his O
deliverer O
. O
The O
plot O
of O
Felix O
was O
quickly O
discovered O
, O
and O
De O
Lacey O
and O
Agatha O
were O
thrown O
into O
prison O
. O
The O
news O
reached O
Felix O
and O
roused O
him O
from O
his O
dream O
of O
pleasure O
. O
His O
blind O
and O
aged O
father O
and O
his O
gentle O
sister O
lay O
in O
a O
noisome O
dungeon O
while O
he O
enjoyed O
the O
free O
air O
and O
the O
society O
of O
her O
whom O
he O
loved O
. O
This O
idea O
was O
torture O
to O
him O
. O
He O
quickly O
arranged O
with O
the O
Turk O
that O
if O
the O
latter O
should O
find O
a O
favourable O
opportunity O
for O
escape O
before O
Felix O
could O
return O
to O
Italy O
, O
Safie O
should O
remain O
as O
a O
boarder O
at O
a O
convent O
at O
Leghorn O
; O
and O
then O
, O
quitting O
the O
lovely O
Arabian O
, O
he O
hastened O
to O
Paris O
and O
delivered O
himself O
up O
to O
the O
vengeance O
of O
the O
law O
, O
hoping O
to O
free O
De O
Lacey O
and O
Agatha O
by O
this O
proceeding O
. O
" O
He O
did O
not O
succeed O
. O
They O
remained O
confined O
for O
five O
months O
before O
the O
trial O
took O
place O
, O
the O
result O
of O
which O
deprived O
them O
of O
their O
fortune O
and O
condemned O
them O
to O
a O
perpetual O
exile O
from O
their O
native O
country O
. O
" O
They O
found O
a O
miserable O
asylum O
in O
the O
cottage O
in O
Germany O
, O
where O
I O
discovered O
them O
. O
Felix O
soon O
learned O
that O
the O
treacherous O
Turk O
, O
for O
whom O
he O
and O
his O
family O
endured O
such O
unheard-of O
oppression O
, O
on O
discovering O
that O
his O
deliverer O
was O
thus O
reduced O
to O
poverty O
and O
ruin O
, O
became O
a O
traitor O
to O
good O
feeling O
and O
honour O
and O
had O
quitted O
Italy O
with O
his O
daughter O
, O
insultingly O
sending O
Felix O
a O
pittance O
of O
money O
to O
aid O
him O
, O
as O
he O
said O
, O
in O
some O
plan O
of O
future O
maintenance O
. O
" O
Such O
were O
the O
events O
that O
preyed O
on O
the O
heart O
of O
Felix O
and O
rendered O
him O
, O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
him O
, O
the O
most O
miserable O
of O
his O
family O
. O
He O
could O
have O
endured O
poverty O
, O
and O
while O
this O
distress O
had O
been O
the O
meed O
of O
his O
virtue O
, O
he O
gloried O
in O
it O
; O
but O
the O
ingratitude O
of O
the O
Turk O
and O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
beloved O
Safie O
were O
misfortunes O
more O
bitter O
and O
irreparable O
. O
The O
arrival O
of O
the O
Arabian O
now O
infused O
new O
life O
into O
his O
soul O
. O
" O
When O
the O
news O
reached O
Leghorn O
that O
Felix O
was O
deprived O
of O
his O
wealth O
and O
rank O
, O
the O
merchant O
commanded O
his O
daughter O
to O
think O
no O
more O
of O
her O
lover O
, O
but O
to O
prepare O
to O
return O
to O
her O
native O
country O
. O
The O
generous O
nature O
of O
Safie O
was O
outraged O
by O
this O
command O
; O
she O
attempted O
to O
expostulate O
with O
her O
father O
, O
but O
he O
left O
her O
angrily O
, O
reiterating O
his O
tyrannical O
mandate O
. O
" O
A O
few O
days O
after O
, O
the O
Turk O
entered O
his O
daughter O
's O
apartment O
and O
told O
her O
hastily O
that O
he O
had O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
his O
residence O
at O
Leghorn O
had O
been O
divulged O
and O
that O
he O
should O
speedily O
be O
delivered O
up O
to O
the O
French O
government O
; O
he O
had O
consequently O
hired O
a O
vessel O
to O
convey O
him O
to O
Constantinople O
, O
for O
which O
city O
he O
should O
sail O
in O
a O
few O
hours O
. O
He O
intended O
to O
leave O
his O
daughter O
under O
the O
care O
of O
a O
confidential O
servant O
, O
to O
follow O
at O
her O
leisure O
with O
the O
greater O
part O
of O
his O
property O
, O
which O
had O
not O
yet O
arrived O
at O
Leghorn O
. O
" O
When O
alone O
, O
Safie O
resolved O
in O
her O
own O
mind O
the O
plan O
of O
conduct O
that O
it O
would O
become O
her O
to O
pursue O
in O
this O
emergency O
. O
A O
residence O
in O
Turkey O
was O
abhorrent O
to O
her O
; O
her O
religion O
and O
her O
feelings O
were O
alike O
averse O
to O
it O
. O
By O
some O
papers O
of O
her O
father O
which O
fell O
into O
her O
hands O
she O
heard O
of O
the O
exile O
of O
her O
lover O
and O
learnt O
the O
name O
of O
the O
spot O
where O
he O
then O
resided O
. O
She O
hesitated O
some O
time O
, O
but O
at O
length O
she O
formed O
her O
determination O
. O
Taking O
with O
her O
some O
jewels O
that O
belonged O
to O
her O
and O
a O
sum O
of O
money O
, O
she O
quitted O
Italy O
with O
an O
attendant O
, O
a O
native O
of O
Leghorn O
, O
but O
who O
understood O
the O
common O
language O
of O
Turkey O
, O
and O
departed O
for O
Germany O
. O
" O
She O
arrived O
in O
safety O
at O
a O
town O
about O
twenty O
leagues O
from O
the O
cottage O
of O
De O
Lacey O
, O
when O
her O
attendant O
fell O
dangerously O
ill. O
Safie O
nursed O
her O
with O
the O
most O
devoted O
affection O
, O
but O
the O
poor O
girl O
died O
, O
and O
the O
Arabian O
was O
left O
alone O
, O
unacquainted O
with O
the O
language O
of O
the O
country O
and O
utterly O
ignorant O
of O
the O
customs O
of O
the O
world O
. O
She O
fell O
, O
however O
, O
into O
good O
hands O
. O
The O
Italian O
had O
mentioned O
the O
name O
of O
the O
