It O
was O
eight O
o'clock O
when O
we O
landed O
; O
we O
walked O
for O
a O
short O
time O
on O
the O
shore O
, O
enjoying O
the O
transitory O
light O
, O
and O
then O
retired O
to O
the O
inn O
and O
contemplated O
the O
lovely O
scene O
of O
waters O
, O
woods O
, O
and O
mountains O
, O
obscured O
in O
darkness O
, O
yet O
still O
displaying O
their O
black O
outlines O
. O
The O
wind O
, O
which O
had O
fallen O
in O
the O
south O
, O
now O
rose O
with O
great O
violence O
in O
the O
west O
. O
The O
moon O
had O
reached O
her O
summit O
in O
the O
heavens O
and O
was O
beginning O
to O
descend O
; O
the O
clouds O
swept O
across O
it O
swifter O
than O
the O
flight O
of O
the O
vulture O
and O
dimmed O
her O
rays O
, O
while O
the O
lake O
reflected O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
busy O
heavens O
, O
rendered O
still O
busier O
by O
the O
restless O
waves O
that O
were O
beginning O
to O
rise O
. O
Suddenly O
a O
heavy O
storm O
of O
rain O
descended O
. O
I O
had O
been O
calm O
during O
the O
day O
, O
but O
so O
soon O
as O
night O
obscured O
the O
shapes O
of O
objects O
, O
a O
thousand O
fears O
arose O
in O
my O
mind O
. O
I O
was O
anxious O
and O
watchful O
, O
while O
my O
right O
hand O
grasped O
a O
pistol O
which O
was O
hidden O
in O
my O
bosom O
; O
every O
sound O
terrified O
me O
, O
but O
I O
resolved O
that O
I O
would O
sell O
my O
life O
dearly O
and O
not O
shrink O
from O
the O
conflict O
until O
my O
own O
life O
or O
that O
of O
my O
adversary O
was O
extinguished O
. O
Elizabeth O
observed O
my O
agitation O
for O
some O
time O
in O
timid O
and O
fearful O
silence O
, O
but O
there O
was O
something O
in O
my O
glance O
which O
communicated O
terror O
to O
her O
, O
and O
trembling O
, O
she O
asked O
, O
" O
What O
is O
it O
that O
agitates O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Victor O
? O
What O
is O
it O
you O
fear O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
! O
Peace O
, O
peace O
, O
my O
love O
, O
" O
replied O
I O
; O
" O
this O
night O
, O
and O
all O
will O
be O
safe O
; O
but O
this O
night O
is O
dreadful O
, O
very O
dreadful O
. O
" O
I O
passed O
an O
hour O
in O
this O
state O
of O
mind O
, O
when O
suddenly O
I O
reflected O
how O
fearful O
the O
combat O
which O
I O
momentarily O
expected O
would O
be O
to O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
I O
earnestly O
entreated O
her O
to O
retire O
, O
resolving O
not O
to O
join O
her O
until O
I O
had O
obtained O
some O
knowledge O
as O
to O
the O
situation O
of O
my O
enemy O
. O
She O
left O
me O
, O
and O
I O
continued O
some O
time O
walking O
up O
and O
down O
the O
passages O
of O
the O
house O
and O
inspecting O
every O
corner O
that O
might O
afford O
a O
retreat O
to O
my O
adversary O
. O
But O
I O
discovered O
no O
trace O
of O
him O
and O
was O
beginning O
to O
conjecture O
that O
some O
fortunate O
chance O
had O
intervened O
to O
prevent O
the O
execution O
of O
his O
menaces O
when O
suddenly O
I O
heard O
a O
shrill O
and O
dreadful O
scream O
. O
It O
came O
from O
the O
room O
into O
which O
Elizabeth O
had O
retired O
. O
As O
I O
heard O
it O
, O
the O
whole O
truth O
rushed O
into O
my O
mind O
, O
my O
arms O
dropped O
, O
the O
motion O
of O
every O
muscle O
and O
fibre O
was O
suspended O
; O
I O
could O
feel O
the O
blood O
trickling O
in O
my O
veins O
and O
tingling O
in O
the O
extremities O
of O
my O
limbs O
. O
This O
state O
lasted O
but O
for O
an O
instant O
; O
the O
scream O
was O
repeated O
, O
and O
I O
rushed O
into O
the O
room O
. O
Great O
God O
! O
Why O
did O
I O
not O
then O
expire O
! O
Why O
am O
I O
here O
to O
relate O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
best O
hope O
and O
the O
purest O
creature O
on O
earth O
? O
She O
was O
there O
, O
lifeless O
and O
inanimate O
, O
thrown O
across O
the O
bed O
, O
her O
head O
hanging O
down O
and O
her O
pale O
and O
distorted O
features O
half O
covered O
by O
her O
hair O
. O
Everywhere O
I O
turn O
I O
see O
the O
same O
figure—her O
bloodless O
arms O
and O
relaxed O
form O
flung O
by O
the O
murderer O
on O
its O
bridal O
bier O
. O
Could O
I O
behold O
this O
and O
live O
? O
Alas O
! O
Life O
is O
obstinate O
and O
clings O
closest O
where O
it O
is O
most O
hated O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
only O
did O
I O
lose O
recollection O
; O
I O
fell O
senseless O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
When O
I O
recovered O
I O
found O
myself O
surrounded O
by O
the O
people O
of O
the O
inn O
; O
their O
countenances O
expressed O
a O
breathless O
terror O
, O
but O
the O
horror O
of O
others O
appeared O
only O
as O
a O
mockery O
, O
a O
shadow O
of O
the O
feelings O
that O
oppressed O
me O
. O
I O
escaped O
from O
them O
to O
the O
room O
where O
lay O
the O
body O
of O
Elizabeth O
, O
my O
love O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
so O
lately O
living O
, O
so O
dear O
, O
so O
worthy O
. O
She O
had O
been O
moved O
from O
the O
posture O
in O
which O
I O
had O
first O
beheld O
her O
, O
and O
now O
, O
as O
she O
lay O
, O
her O
head O
upon O
her O
arm O
and O
a O
handkerchief O
thrown O
across O
her O
face O
and O
neck O
, O
I O
might O
have O
supposed O
her O
asleep O
. O
I O
rushed O
towards O
her O
and O
embraced O
her O
with O
ardour O
, O
but O
the O
deadly O
languor O
and O
coldness O
of O
the O
limbs O
told O
me O
that O
what O
I O
now O
held O
in O
my O
arms O
had O
ceased O
to O
be O
the O
Elizabeth O
whom O
I O
had O
loved O
and O
cherished O
. O
The O
murderous O
mark O
of O
the O
fiend O
's O
grasp O
was O
on O
her O
neck O
, O
and O
the O
breath O
had O
ceased O
to O
issue O
from O
her O
lips O
. O
While O
I O
still O
hung O
over O
her O
in O
the O
agony O
of O
despair O
, O
I O
happened O
to O
look O
up O
. O
The O
windows O
of O
the O
room O
had O
before O
been O
darkened O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
a O
kind O
of O
panic O
on O
seeing O
the O
pale O
yellow O
light O
of O
the O
moon O
illuminate O
the O
chamber O
. O
The O
shutters O
had O
been O
thrown O
back O
, O
and O
with O
a O
sensation O
of O
horror O
not O
to O
be O
described O
, O
I O
saw O
at O
the O
open O
window O
a O
figure O
the O
most O
hideous O
and O
abhorred O
. O
A O
grin O
was O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
monster O
; O
he O
seemed O
to O
jeer O
, O
as O
with O
his O
fiendish O
finger O
he O
pointed O
towards O
the O
corpse O
of O
my O
wife O
. O
I O
rushed O
towards O
the O
window O
, O
and O
drawing O
a O
pistol O
from O
my O
bosom O
, O
fired O
; O
but O
he O
eluded O
me O
, O
leaped O
from O
his O
station O
, O
and O
running O
with O
the O
swiftness O
of O
lightning O
, O
plunged O
into O
the O
lake O
. O
The O
report O
of O
the O
pistol O
brought O
a O
crowd O
into O
the O
room O
. O
I O
pointed O
to O
the O
spot O
where O
he O
had O
disappeared O
, O
and O
we O
followed O
the O
track O
with O
boats O
; O
nets O
were O
cast O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
After O
passing O
several O
hours O
, O
we O
returned O
hopeless O
, O
most O
of O
my O
companions O
believing O
it O
to O
have O
been O
a O
form O
conjured O
up O
by O
my O
fancy O
. O
After O
having O
landed O
, O
they O
proceeded O
to O
search O
the O
country O
, O
parties O
going O
in O
different O
directions O
among O
the O
woods O
and O
vines O
. O
I O
attempted O
to O
accompany O
them O
and O
proceeded O
a O
short O
distance O
from O
the O
house O
, O
but O
my O
head O
whirled O
round O
, O
my O
steps O
were O
like O
those O
of O
a O
drunken O
man O
, O
I O
fell O
at O
last O
in O
a O
state O
of O
utter O
exhaustion O
; O
a O
film O
covered O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
my O
skin O
was O
parched O
with O
the O
heat O
of O
fever O
. O
In O
this O
state O
I O
was O
carried O
back O
and O
placed O
on O
a O
bed O
, O
hardly O
conscious O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
; O
my O
eyes O
wandered O
round O
the O
room O
as O
if O
to O
seek O
something O
that O
I O
had O
lost O
. O
After O
an O
interval O
I O
arose O
, O
and O
as O
if O
by O
instinct O
, O
crawled O
into O
the O
room O
where O
the O
corpse O
of O
my O
beloved O
lay O
. O
There O
were O
women O
weeping O
around O
; O
I O
hung O
over O
it O
and O
joined O
my O
sad O
tears O
to O
theirs O
; O
all O
this O
time O
no O
distinct O
idea O
presented O
itself O
to O
my O
mind O
, O
but O
my O
thoughts O
rambled O
to O
various O
subjects O
, O
reflecting O
confusedly O
on O
my O
misfortunes O
and O
their O
cause O
. O
I O
was O
bewildered O
, O
in O
a O
cloud O
of O
wonder O
and O
horror O
. O
The O
death O
of O
William O
, O
the O
execution O
of O
Justine O
, O
the O
murder O
of O
Clerval O
, O
and O
lastly O
of O
my O
wife O
; O
even O
at O
that O
moment O
I O
knew O
not O
that O
my O
only O
remaining O
friends O
were O
safe O
from O
the O
malignity O
of O
the O
fiend O
; O
my O
father O
even O
now O
might O
be O
writhing O
under O
his O
grasp O
, O
and O
Ernest O
might O
be O
dead O
at O
his O
feet O
. O
This O
idea O
made O
me O
shudder O
and O
recalled O
me O
to O
action O
. O
I O
started O
up O
and O
resolved O
to O
return O
to O
Geneva O
with O
all O
possible O
speed O
. O
There O
were O
no O
horses O
to O
be O
procured O
, O
and O
I O
must O
return O
by O
the O
lake O
; O
but O
the O
wind O
was O
unfavourable O
, O
and O
the O
rain O
fell O
in O
torrents O
. O
However O
, O
it O
was O
hardly O
morning O
, O
and O
I O
might O
reasonably O
hope O
to O
arrive O
by O
night O
. O
I O
hired O
men O
to O
row O
and O
took O
an O
oar O
myself O
, O
for O
I O
had O
always O
experienced O
relief O
from O
mental O
torment O
in O
bodily O
exercise O
. O
But O
the O
overflowing O
misery O
I O
now O
felt O
, O
and O
the O
excess O
of O
agitation O
that O
I O
endured O
rendered O
me O
incapable O
of O
any O
exertion O
. O
I O
threw O
down O
the O
oar O
, O
and O
leaning O
my O
head O
upon O
my O
hands O
, O
gave O
way O
to O
every O
gloomy O
idea O
that O
arose O
. O
If O
I O
looked O
up O
, O
I O
saw O
scenes O
which O
were O
familiar O
to O
me O
in O
my O
happier O
time O
and O
which O
I O
had O
contemplated O
but O
the O
day O
before O
in O
the O
company O
of O
her O
who O
was O
now O
but O
a O
shadow O
and O
a O
recollection O
. O
Tears O
streamed O
from O
my O
eyes O
. O
The O
rain O
had O
ceased O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
fish O
play O
in O
the O
waters O
as O
they O
had O
done O
a O
few O
hours O
before O
; O
they O
had O
then O
been O
observed O
by O
Elizabeth O
. O
Nothing O
is O
so O
painful O
to O
the O
human O
mind O
as O
a O
great O
and O
sudden O
change O
. O
The O
sun O
might O
shine O
or O
the O
clouds O
might O
lower O
, O
but O
nothing O
could O
appear O
to O
me O
as O
it O
had O
done O
the O
day O
before O
. O
A O
fiend O
had O
snatched O
from O
me O
every O
hope O
of O
future O
happiness O
; O
no O
creature O
had O
ever O
been O
so O
miserable O
as O
I O
was O
; O
so O
frightful O
an O
event O
is O
single O
in O
the O
history O
of O
man O
. O
But O
why O
should O
I O
dwell O
upon O
the O
incidents O
that O
followed O
this O
last O
overwhelming O
event O
? O
Mine O
has O
been O
a O
tale O
of O
horrors O
; O
I O
have O
reached O
their O
_acme_ O
, O
and O
what O
I O
must O
now O
relate O
can O
but O
be O
tedious O
to O
you O
. O
Know O
that O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
my O
friends O
were O
snatched O
away O
; O
I O
was O
left O
desolate O
. O
My O
own O
strength O
is O
exhausted O
, O
and O
I O
must O
tell O
, O
in O
a O
few O
words O
, O
what O
remains O
of O
my O
hideous O
narration O
. O
I O
arrived O
at O
Geneva O
. O
My O
father O
and O
Ernest O
yet O
lived O
, O
but O
the O
former O
sunk O
under O
the O
tidings O
that O
I O
bore O
. O
I O
see O
him O
now O
, O
excellent O
and O
venerable O
old O
man O
! O
His O
eyes O
wandered O
in O
vacancy O
, O
for O
they O
had O
lost O
their O
charm O
and O
their O
delight—his O
Elizabeth O
, O
his O
more O
than O
daughter O
, O
whom O
he O
doted O
on O
with O
all O
that O
affection O
which O
a O
man O
feels O
, O
who O
in O
the O
decline O
of O
life O
, O
having O
few O
affections O
, O
clings O
more O
earnestly O
to O
those O
that O
remain O
. O
Cursed O
, O
cursed O
be O
the O
fiend O
that O
brought O
misery O
on O
his O
grey O
hairs O
and O
doomed O
him O
to O
waste O
in O
wretchedness O
! O
He O
could O
not O
live O
under O
the O
horrors O
that O
were O
accumulated O
around O
him O
; O
the O
springs O
of O
existence O
suddenly O
gave O
way O
; O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
rise O
from O
his O
bed O
, O
and O
in O
a O
few O
days O
he O
died O
in O
my O
arms O
. O
What O
then O
became O
of O
me O
? O
I O
know O
not O
; O
I O
lost O
sensation O
, O
and O
chains O
and O
darkness O
were O
the O
only O
objects O
that O
pressed O
upon O
me O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
dreamt O
that O
I O
wandered O
in O
flowery O
meadows O
and O
pleasant O
vales O
with O
the O
friends O
of O
my O
youth O
, O
but O
I O
awoke O
and O
found O
myself O
in O
a O
dungeon O
. O
Melancholy O
followed O
, O
but O
by O
degrees O
I O
gained O
a O
clear O
conception O
of O
my O
miseries O
and O
situation O
and O
was O
then O
released O
from O
my O
prison O
. O
For O
they O
had O
called O
me O
mad O
, O
and O
during O
many O
months O
, O
as O
I O
understood O
, O
a O
solitary O
cell O
had O
been O
my O
habitation O
. O
Liberty O
, O
however O
, O
had O
been O
a O
useless O
gift O
to O
me O
, O
had O
I O
not O
, O
as O
I O
awakened O
to O
reason O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
awakened O
to O
revenge O
. O
As O
the O
memory O
of O
past O
misfortunes O
pressed O
upon O
me O
, O
I O
began O
to O
reflect O
on O
their O
cause—the O
monster O
whom O
I O
had O
created O
, O
the O
miserable O
dæmon O
whom O
I O
had O
sent O
abroad O
into O
the O
world O
for O
my O
destruction O
. O
I O
was O
possessed O
by O
a O
maddening O
rage O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
him O
, O
and O
desired O
and O
ardently O
prayed O
that O
I O
might O
have O
him O
within O
my O
grasp O
to O
wreak O
a O
great O
and O
signal O
revenge O
on O
his O
cursed O
head O
. O
Nor O
did O
my O
hate O
long O
confine O
itself O
to O
useless O
wishes O
; O
I O
began O
to O
reflect O
on O
the O
best O
means O
of O
securing O
him O
; O
and O
for O
this O
purpose O
, O
about O
a O
month O
after O
my O
release O
, O
I O
repaired O
to O
a O
criminal O
judge O
in O
the O
town O
and O
told O
him O
that O
I O
had O
an O
accusation O
to O
make O
, O
that O
I O
knew O
the O
destroyer O
of O
my O
family O
, O
and O
that O
I O
required O
him O
to O
exert O
his O
whole O
authority O
for O
the O
apprehension O
of O
the O
murderer O
. O
The O
magistrate O
listened O
to O
me O
with O
attention O
and O
kindness O
. O
" O
Be O
assured O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
no O
pains O
or O
exertions O
on O
my O
part O
shall O
be O
spared O
to O
discover O
the O
villain O
. O
" O
" O
I O
thank O
you O
, O
" O
replied O
I O
; O
" O
listen O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
the O
deposition O
that O
I O
have O
to O
make O
. O
It O
is O
indeed O
a O
tale O
so O
strange O
that O
I O
should O
fear O
you O
would O
not O
credit O
it O
were O
there O
not O
something O
in O
truth O
which O
, O
however O
wonderful O
, O
forces O
conviction O
. O
The O
story O
is O
too O
connected O
to O
be O
mistaken O
for O
a O
dream O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
motive O
for O
falsehood O
. O
" O
My O
manner O
as O
I O
thus O
addressed O
him O
was O
impressive O
but O
calm O
; O
I O
had O
formed O
in O
my O
own O
heart O
a O
resolution O
to O
pursue O
my O
destroyer O
to O
death O
, O
and O
this O
purpose O
quieted O
my O
agony O
and O
for O
an O
interval O
reconciled O
me O
to O
life O
. O
I O
now O
related O
my O
history O
briefly O
but O
with O
firmness O
and O
precision O
, O
marking O
the O
dates O
with O
accuracy O
and O
never O
deviating O
into O
invective O
or O
exclamation O
. O
The O
magistrate O
appeared O
at O
first O
perfectly O
incredulous O
, O
but O
as O
I O
continued O
he O
became O
more O
attentive O
and O
interested O
; O
I O
saw O
him O
sometimes O
shudder O
with O
horror O
; O
at O
others O
a O
lively O
surprise O
, O
unmingled O
with O
disbelief O
, O
was O
painted O
on O
his O
countenance O
. O
When O
I O
had O
concluded O
my O
narration O
, O
I O
said O
, O
" O
This O
is O
the O
being O
whom O
I O
accuse O
and O
for O
whose O
seizure O
and O
punishment O
I O
call O
upon O
you O
to O
exert O
your O
whole O
power O
. O
It O
is O
your O
duty O
as O
a O
magistrate O
, O
and O
I O
believe O
and O
hope O
that O
your O
feelings O
as O
a O
man O
will O
not O
revolt O
from O
the O
execution O
of O
those O
functions O
on O
this O
occasion O
. O
" O
This O
address O
caused O
a O
considerable O
change O
in O
the O
physiognomy O
of O
my O
own O
auditor O
. O
He O
had O
heard O
my O
story O
with O
that O
half O
kind O
of O
belief O
that O
is O
given O
to O
a O
tale O
of O
spirits O
and O
supernatural O
events O
; O
but O
when O
he O
was O
called O
upon O
to O
act O
officially O
in O
consequence O
, O
the O
whole O
tide O
of O
his O
incredulity O
returned O
. O
He O
, O
however O
, O
answered O
mildly O
, O
" O
I O
would O
willingly O
afford O
you O
every O
aid O
in O
your O
pursuit O
, O
but O
the O
creature O
of O
whom O
you O
speak O
appears O
to O
have O
powers O
which O
would O
put O
all O
my O
exertions O
to O
defiance O
. O
Who O
can O
follow O
an O
animal O
which O
can O
traverse O
the O
sea O
of O
ice O
and O
inhabit O
caves O
and O
dens O
where O
no O
man O
would O
venture O
to O
intrude O
? O
Besides O
, O
some O
months O
have O
elapsed O
since O
the O
commission O
of O
his O
crimes O
, O
and O
no O
one O
can O
conjecture O
to O
what O
place O
he O
has O
wandered O
or O
what O
region O
he O
may O
now O
inhabit O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
doubt O
that O
he O
hovers O
near O
the O
spot O
which O
I O
inhabit O
, O
and O
if O
he O
has O
indeed O
taken O
refuge O
in O
the O
Alps O
, O
he O
may O
be O
hunted O
like O
the O
chamois O
and O
destroyed O
as O
a O
beast O
of O
prey O
. O
But O
I O
perceive O
your O
thoughts O
; O
you O
do O
not O
credit O
my O
narrative O
and O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
pursue O
my O
enemy O
with O
the O
punishment O
which O
is O
his O
desert O
. O
" O
As O
I O
spoke O
, O
rage O
sparkled O
in O
my O
eyes O
; O
the O
magistrate O
was O
intimidated O
. O
" O
You O
are O
mistaken O
, O
" O
said O
he O
. O
" O
I O
will O
exert O
myself O
, O
and O
if O
it O
is O
in O
my O
power O
to O
seize O
the O
monster O
, O
be O
assured O
that O
he O
shall O
suffer O
punishment O
proportionate O
to O
his O
crimes O
. O
But O
I O
fear O
, O
from O
what O
you O
have O
yourself O
described O
to O
be O
his O
properties O
, O
that O
this O
will O
prove O
impracticable O
; O
and O
thus O
, O
while O
every O
proper O
measure O
is O
pursued O
, O
you O
should O
make O
up O
your O
mind O
to O
disappointment O
. O
" O
" O
That O
can O
not O
be O
; O
but O
all O
that O
I O
can O
say O
will O
be O
of O
little O
avail O
. O
My O
revenge O
is O
of O
no O
moment O
to O
you O
; O
yet O
, O
while O
I O
allow O
it O
to O
be O
a O
vice O
, O
I O
confess O
that O
it O
is O
the O
devouring O
and O
only O
passion O
of O
my O
soul O
. O
My O
rage O
is O
unspeakable O
when O
I O
reflect O
that O
the O
murderer O
, O
whom O
I O
have O
turned O
loose O
upon O
society O
, O
still O
exists O
. O
You O
refuse O
my O
just O
demand O
; O
I O
have O
but O
one O
resource O
, O
and O
I O
devote O
myself O
, O
either O
in O
my O
life O
or O
death O
, O
to O
his O
destruction O
. O
" O
I O
trembled O
with O
excess O
of O
agitation O
as O
I O
said O
this O
; O
there O
was O
a O
frenzy O
in O
my O
manner O
, O
and O
something O
, O
I O
doubt O
not O
, O
of O
that O
haughty O
fierceness O
which O
the O
martyrs O
of O
old O
are O
said O
to O
have O
possessed O
. O
But O
to O
a O
Genevan O
magistrate O
, O
whose O
mind O
was O
occupied O
by O
far O
other O
ideas O
than O
those O
of O
devotion O
and O
heroism O
, O
this O
elevation O
of O
mind O
had O
much O
the O
appearance O
of O
madness O
. O
He O
endeavoured O
to O
soothe O
me O
as O
a O
nurse O
does O
a O
child O
and O
reverted O
to O
my O
tale O
as O
the O
effects O
of O
delirium O
. O
" O
Man O
, O
" O
I O
cried O
, O
" O
how O
ignorant O
art O
thou O
in O
thy O
pride O
of O
wisdom O
! O
Cease O
; O
you O
know O
not O
what O
it O
is O
you O
say O
. O
" O
I O
broke O
from O
the O
house O
angry O
and O
disturbed O
and O
retired O
to O
meditate O
on O
some O
other O
mode O
of O
action O
. O
