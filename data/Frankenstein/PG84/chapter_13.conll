Nothing O
is O
more O
painful O
to O
the O
human O
mind O
than O
, O
after O
the O
feelings O
have O
been O
worked O
up O
by O
a O
quick O
succession O
of O
events O
, O
the O
dead O
calmness O
of O
inaction O
and O
certainty O
which O
follows O
and O
deprives O
the O
soul O
both O
of O
hope O
and O
fear O
. O
Justine O
died O
, O
she O
rested O
, O
and O
I O
was O
alive O
. O
The O
blood O
flowed O
freely O
in O
my O
veins O
, O
but O
a O
weight O
of O
despair O
and O
remorse O
pressed O
on O
my O
heart O
which O
nothing O
could O
remove O
. O
Sleep O
fled O
from O
my O
eyes O
; O
I O
wandered O
like O
an O
evil O
spirit O
, O
for O
I O
had O
committed O
deeds O
of O
mischief O
beyond O
description O
horrible O
, O
and O
more O
, O
much O
more O
( O
I O
persuaded O
myself O
) O
was O
yet O
behind O
. O
Yet O
my O
heart O
overflowed O
with O
kindness O
and O
the O
love O
of O
virtue O
. O
I O
had O
begun O
life O
with O
benevolent O
intentions O
and O
thirsted O
for O
the O
moment O
when O
I O
should O
put O
them O
in O
practice O
and O
make O
myself O
useful O
to O
my O
fellow O
beings O
. O
Now O
all O
was O
blasted O
; O
instead O
of O
that O
serenity O
of O
conscience O
which O
allowed O
me O
to O
look O
back O
upon O
the O
past O
with O
self-satisfaction O
, O
and O
from O
thence O
to O
gather O
promise O
of O
new O
hopes O
, O
I O
was O
seized O
by O
remorse O
and O
the O
sense O
of O
guilt O
, O
which O
hurried O
me O
away O
to O
a O
hell O
of O
intense O
tortures O
such O
as O
no O
language O
can O
describe O
. O
This O
state O
of O
mind O
preyed O
upon O
my O
health O
, O
which O
had O
perhaps O
never O
entirely O
recovered O
from O
the O
first O
shock O
it O
had O
sustained O
. O
I O
shunned O
the O
face O
of O
man O
; O
all O
sound O
of O
joy O
or O
complacency O
was O
torture O
to O
me O
; O
solitude O
was O
my O
only O
consolation—deep O
, O
dark O
, O
deathlike O
solitude O
. O
My O
father O
observed O
with O
pain O
the O
alteration O
perceptible O
in O
my O
disposition O
and O
habits O
and O
endeavoured O
by O
arguments O
deduced O
from O
the O
feelings O
of O
his O
serene O
conscience O
and O
guiltless O
life O
to O
inspire O
me O
with O
fortitude O
and O
awaken O
in O
me O
the O
courage O
to O
dispel O
the O
dark O
cloud O
which O
brooded O
over O
me O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
, O
Victor O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
that O
I O
do O
not O
suffer O
also O
? O
No O
one O
could O
love O
a O
child O
more O
than O
I O
loved O
your O
brother O
" O
—tears O
came O
into O
his O
eyes O
as O
he O
spoke— O
" O
but O
is O
it O
not O
a O
duty O
to O
the O
survivors O
that O
we O
should O
refrain O
from O
augmenting O
their O
unhappiness O
by O
an O
appearance O
of O
immoderate O
grief O
? O
It O
is O
also O
a O
duty O
owed O
to O
yourself O
, O
for O
excessive O
sorrow O
prevents O
improvement O
or O
enjoyment O
, O
or O
even O
the O
discharge O
of O
daily O
usefulness O
, O
without O
which O
no O
man O
is O
fit O
for O
society O
. O
" O
This O
advice O
, O
although O
good O
, O
was O
totally O
inapplicable O
to O
my O
case O
; O
I O
should O
have O
been O
the O
first O
to O
hide O
my O
grief O
and O
console O
my O
friends O
if O
remorse O
had O
not O
mingled O
its O
bitterness O
, O
and O
terror O
its O
alarm O
, O
with O
my O
other O
sensations O
. O
Now O
I O
could O
only O
answer O
my O
father O
with O
a O
look O
of O
despair O
and O
endeavour O
to O
hide O
myself O
from O
his O
view O
. O
About O
this O
time O
we O
retired O
to O
our O
house O
at O
Belrive O
. O
This O
change O
was O
particularly O
agreeable O
to O
me O
. O
The O
shutting O
of O
the O
gates O
regularly O
at O
ten O
o'clock O
and O
the O
impossibility O
of O
remaining O
on O
the O
lake O
after O
that O
hour O
had O
rendered O
our O
residence O
within O
the O
walls O
of O
Geneva O
very O
irksome O
to O
me O
. O
I O
was O
now O
free O
. O
Often O
, O
after O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
had O
retired O
for O
the O
night O
, O
I O
took O
the O
boat O
and O
passed O
many O
hours O
upon O
the O
water O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
with O
my O
sails O
set O
, O
I O
was O
carried O
by O
the O
wind O
; O
and O
sometimes O
, O
after O
rowing O
into O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
lake O
, O
I O
left O
the O
boat O
to O
pursue O
its O
own O
course O
and O
gave O
way O
to O
my O
own O
miserable O
reflections O
. O
I O
was O
often O
tempted O
, O
when O
all O
was O
at O
peace O
around O
me O
, O
and O
I O
the O
only O
unquiet O
thing O
that O
wandered O
restless O
in O
a O
scene O
so O
beautiful O
and O
heavenly—if O
I O
except O
some O
bat O
, O
or O
the O
frogs O
, O
whose O
harsh O
and O
interrupted O
croaking O
was O
heard O
only O
when O
I O
approached O
the O
shore—often O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
was O
tempted O
to O
plunge O
into O
the O
silent O
lake O
, O
that O
the O
waters O
might O
close O
over O
me O
and O
my O
calamities O
for O
ever O
. O
But O
I O
was O
restrained O
, O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
heroic O
and O
suffering O
Elizabeth O
, O
whom O
I O
tenderly O
loved O
, O
and O
whose O
existence O
was O
bound O
up O
in O
mine O
. O
I O
thought O
also O
of O
my O
father O
and O
surviving O
brother O
; O
should O
I O
by O
my O
base O
desertion O
leave O
them O
exposed O
and O
unprotected O
to O
the O
malice O
of O
the O
fiend O
whom O
I O
had O
let O
loose O
among O
them O
? O
At O
these O
moments O
I O
wept O
bitterly O
and O
wished O
that O
peace O
would O
revisit O
my O
mind O
only O
that O
I O
might O
afford O
them O
consolation O
and O
happiness O
. O
But O
that O
could O
not O
be O
. O
Remorse O
extinguished O
every O
hope O
. O
I O
had O
been O
the O
author O
of O
unalterable O
evils O
, O
and O
I O
lived O
in O
daily O
fear O
lest O
the O
monster O
whom O
I O
had O
created O
should O
perpetrate O
some O
new O
wickedness O
. O
I O
had O
an O
obscure O
feeling O
that O
all O
was O
not O
over O
and O
that O
he O
would O
still O
commit O
some O
signal O
crime O
, O
which O
by O
its O
enormity O
should O
almost O
efface O
the O
recollection O
of O
the O
past O
. O
There O
was O
always O
scope O
for O
fear O
so O
long O
as O
anything O
I O
loved O
remained O
behind O
. O
My O
abhorrence O
of O
this O
fiend O
can O
not O
be O
conceived O
. O
When O
I O
thought O
of O
him O
I O
gnashed O
my O
teeth O
, O
my O
eyes O
became O
inflamed O
, O
and O
I O
ardently O
wished O
to O
extinguish O
that O
life O
which O
I O
had O
so O
thoughtlessly O
bestowed O
. O
When O
I O
reflected O
on O
his O
crimes O
and O
malice O
, O
my O
hatred O
and O
revenge O
burst O
all O
bounds O
of O
moderation O
. O
I O
would O
have O
made O
a O
pilgrimage O
to O
the O
highest O
peak O
of O
the O
Andes O
, O
could O
I O
, O
when O
there O
, O
have O
precipitated O
him O
to O
their O
base O
. O
I O
wished O
to O
see O
him O
again O
, O
that O
I O
might O
wreak O
the O
utmost O
extent O
of O
abhorrence O
on O
his O
head O
and O
avenge O
the O
deaths O
of O
William O
and O
Justine O
. O
Our O
house O
was O
the O
house O
of O
mourning O
. O
My O
father O
's O
health O
was O
deeply O
shaken O
by O
the O
horror O
of O
the O
recent O
events O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
sad O
and O
desponding O
; O
she O
no O
longer O
took O
delight O
in O
her O
ordinary O
occupations O
; O
all O
pleasure O
seemed O
to O
her O
sacrilege O
toward O
the O
dead O
; O
eternal O
woe O
and O
tears O
she O
then O
thought O
was O
the O
just O
tribute O
she O
should O
pay O
to O
innocence O
so O
blasted O
and O
destroyed O
. O
She O
was O
no O
longer O
that O
happy O
creature O
who O
in O
earlier O
youth O
wandered O
with O
me O
on O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
lake O
and O
talked O
with O
ecstasy O
of O
our O
future O
prospects O
. O
The O
first O
of O
those O
sorrows O
which O
are O
sent O
to O
wean O
us O
from O
the O
earth O
had O
visited O
her O
, O
and O
its O
dimming O
influence O
quenched O
her O
dearest O
smiles O
. O
" O
When O
I O
reflect O
, O
my O
dear O
cousin O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
on O
the O
miserable O
death O
of O
Justine O
Moritz O
, O
I O
no O
longer O
see O
the O
world O
and O
its O
works O
as O
they O
before O
appeared O
to O
me O
. O
Before O
, O
I O
looked O
upon O
the O
accounts O
of O
vice O
and O
injustice O
that O
I O
read O
in O
books O
or O
heard O
from O
others O
as O
tales O
of O
ancient O
days O
or O
imaginary O
evils O
; O
at O
least O
they O
were O
remote O
and O
more O
familiar O
to O
reason O
than O
to O
the O
imagination O
; O
but O
now O
misery O
has O
come O
home O
, O
and O
men O
appear O
to O
me O
as O
monsters O
thirsting O
for O
each O
other O
's O
blood O
. O
Yet O
I O
am O
certainly O
unjust O
. O
Everybody O
believed O
that O
poor O
girl O
to O
be O
guilty O
; O
and O
if O
she O
could O
have O
committed O
the O
crime O
for O
which O
she O
suffered O
, O
assuredly O
she O
would O
have O
been O
the O
most O
depraved O
of O
human O
creatures O
. O
For O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
few O
jewels O
, O
to O
have O
murdered O
the O
son O
of O
her O
benefactor O
and O
friend O
, O
a O
child O
whom O
she O
had O
nursed O
from O
its O
birth O
, O
and O
appeared O
to O
love O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
her O
own O
! O
I O
could O
not O
consent O
to O
the O
death O
of O
any O
human O
being O
, O
but O
certainly O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
such O
a O
creature O
unfit O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
society O
of O
men O
. O
But O
she O
was O
innocent O
. O
I O
know O
, O
I O
feel O
she O
was O
innocent O
; O
you O
are O
of O
the O
same O
opinion O
, O
and O
that O
confirms O
me O
. O
Alas O
! O
Victor O
, O
when O
falsehood O
can O
look O
so O
like O
the O
truth O
, O
who O
can O
assure O
themselves O
of O
certain O
happiness O
? O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
were O
walking O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
precipice O
, O
towards O
which O
thousands O
are O
crowding O
and O
endeavouring O
to O
plunge O
me O
into O
the O
abyss O
. O
William O
and O
Justine O
were O
assassinated O
, O
and O
the O
murderer O
escapes O
; O
he O
walks O
about O
the O
world O
free O
, O
and O
perhaps O
respected O
. O
But O
even O
if O
I O
were O
condemned O
to O
suffer O
on O
the O
scaffold O
for O
the O
same O
crimes O
, O
I O
would O
not O
change O
places O
with O
such O
a O
wretch O
. O
" O
I O
listened O
to O
this O
discourse O
with O
the O
extremest O
agony O
. O
I O
, O
not O
in O
deed O
, O
but O
in O
effect O
, O
was O
the O
true O
murderer O
. O
Elizabeth O
read O
my O
anguish O
in O
my O
countenance O
, O
and O
kindly O
taking O
my O
hand O
, O
said O
, O
" O
My O
dearest O
friend O
, O
you O
must O
calm O
yourself O
. O
These O
events O
have O
affected O
me O
, O
God O
knows O
how O
deeply O
; O
but O
I O
am O
not O
so O
wretched O
as O
you O
are O
. O
There O
is O
an O
expression O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
sometimes O
of O
revenge O
, O
in O
your O
countenance O
that O
makes O
me O
tremble O
. O
Dear O
Victor O
, O
banish O
these O
dark O
passions O
. O
Remember O
the O
friends O
around O
you O
, O
who O
centre O
all O
their O
hopes O
in O
you O
. O
Have O
we O
lost O
the O
power O
of O
rendering O
you O
happy O
? O
Ah O
! O
While O
we O
love O
, O
while O
we O
are O
true O
to O
each O
other O
, O
here O
in O
this O
land O
of O
peace O
and O
beauty O
, O
your O
native O
country O
, O
we O
may O
reap O
every O
tranquil O
blessing—what O
can O
disturb O
our O
peace O
? O
" O
And O
could O
not O
such O
words O
from O
her O
whom O
I O
fondly O
prized O
before O
every O
other O
gift O
of O
fortune O
suffice O
to O
chase O
away O
the O
fiend O
that O
lurked O
in O
my O
heart O
? O
Even O
as O
she O
spoke O
I O
drew O
near O
to O
her O
, O
as O
if O
in O
terror O
, O
lest O
at O
that O
very O
moment O
the O
destroyer O
had O
been O
near O
to O
rob O
me O
of O
her O
. O
Thus O
not O
the O
tenderness O
of O
friendship O
, O
nor O
the O
beauty O
of O
earth O
, O
nor O
of O
heaven O
, O
could O
redeem O
my O
soul O
from O
woe O
; O
the O
very O
accents O
of O
love O
were O
ineffectual O
. O
I O
was O
encompassed O
by O
a O
cloud O
which O
no O
beneficial O
influence O
could O
penetrate O
. O
The O
wounded O
deer O
dragging O
its O
fainting O
limbs O
to O
some O
untrodden O
brake O
, O
there O
to O
gaze O
upon O
the O
arrow O
which O
had O
pierced O
it O
, O
and O
to O
die O
, O
was O
but O
a O
type O
of O
me O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
could O
cope O
with O
the O
sullen O
despair O
that O
overwhelmed O
me O
, O
but O
sometimes O
the O
whirlwind O
passions O
of O
my O
soul O
drove O
me O
to O
seek O
, O
by O
bodily O
exercise O
and O
by O
change O
of O
place O
, O
some O
relief O
from O
my O
intolerable O
sensations O
. O
It O
was O
during O
an O
access O
of O
this O
kind O
that O
I O
suddenly O
left O
my O
home O
, O
and O
bending O
my O
steps O
towards O
the O
near O
Alpine O
valleys O
, O
sought O
in O
the O
magnificence O
, O
the O
eternity O
of O
such O
scenes O
, O
to O
forget O
myself O
and O
my O
ephemeral O
, O
because O
human O
, O
sorrows O
. O
My O
wanderings O
were O
directed O
towards O
the O
valley O
of O
Chamounix O
. O
I O
had O
visited O
it O
frequently O
during O
my O
boyhood O
. O
Six O
years O
had O
passed O
since O
then O
: O
_I_ O
was O
a O
wreck O
, O
but O
nought O
had O
changed O
in O
those O
savage O
and O
enduring O
scenes O
. O
I O
performed O
the O
first O
part O
of O
my O
journey O
on O
horseback O
. O
I O
afterwards O
hired O
a O
mule O
, O
as O
the O
more O
sure-footed O
and O
least O
liable O
to O
receive O
injury O
on O
these O
rugged O
roads O
. O
The O
weather O
was O
fine O
; O
it O
was O
about O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
month O
of O
August O
, O
nearly O
two O
months O
after O
the O
death O
of O
Justine O
, O
that O
miserable O
epoch O
from O
which O
I O
dated O
all O
my O
woe O
. O
The O
weight O
upon O
my O
spirit O
was O
sensibly O
lightened O
as O
I O
plunged O
yet O
deeper O
in O
the O
ravine O
of O
Arve O
. O
The O
immense O
mountains O
and O
precipices O
that O
overhung O
me O
on O
every O
side O
, O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
river O
raging O
among O
the O
rocks O
, O
and O
the O
dashing O
of O
the O
waterfalls O
around O
spoke O
of O
a O
power O
mighty O
as O
Omnipotence—and O
I O
ceased O
to O
fear O
or O
to O
bend O
before O
any O
being O
less O
almighty O
than O
that O
which O
had O
created O
and O
ruled O
the O
elements O
, O
here O
displayed O
in O
their O
most O
terrific O
guise O
. O
Still O
, O
as O
I O
ascended O
higher O
, O
the O
valley O
assumed O
a O
more O
magnificent O
and O
astonishing O
character O
. O
Ruined O
castles O
hanging O
on O
the O
precipices O
of O
piny O
mountains O
, O
the O
impetuous O
Arve O
, O
and O
cottages O
every O
here O
and O
there O
peeping O
forth O
from O
among O
the O
trees O
formed O
a O
scene O
of O
singular O
beauty O
. O
But O
it O
was O
augmented O
and O
rendered O
sublime O
by O
the O
mighty O
Alps O
, O
whose O
white O
and O
shining O
pyramids O
and O
domes O
towered O
above O
all O
, O
as O
belonging O
to O
another O
earth O
, O
the O
habitations O
of O
another O
race O
of O
beings O
. O
I O
passed O
the O
bridge O
of O
Pélissier O
, O
where O
the O
ravine O
, O
which O
the O
river O
forms O
, O
opened O
before O
me O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
ascend O
the O
mountain O
that O
overhangs O
it O
. O
Soon O
after O
, O
I O
entered O
the O
valley O
of O
Chamounix O
. O
This O
valley O
is O
more O
wonderful O
and O
sublime O
, O
but O
not O
so O
beautiful O
and O
picturesque O
as O
that O
of O
Servox O
, O
through O
which O
I O
had O
just O
passed O
. O
The O
high O
and O
snowy O
mountains O
were O
its O
immediate O
boundaries O
, O
but O
I O
saw O
no O
more O
ruined O
castles O
and O
fertile O
fields O
. O
Immense O
glaciers O
approached O
the O
road O
; O
I O
heard O
the O
rumbling O
thunder O
of O
the O
falling O
avalanche O
and O
marked O
the O
smoke O
of O
its O
passage O
. O
Mont O
Blanc O
, O
the O
supreme O
and O
magnificent O
Mont O
Blanc O
, O
raised O
itself O
from O
the O
surrounding O
_aiguilles_ O
, O
and O
its O
tremendous O
_dôme_ O
overlooked O
the O
valley O
. O
A O
tingling O
long-lost O
sense O
of O
pleasure O
often O
came O
across O
me O
during O
this O
journey O
. O
Some O
turn O
in O
the O
road O
, O
some O
new O
object O
suddenly O
perceived O
and O
recognised O
, O
reminded O
me O
of O
days O
gone O
by O
, O
and O
were O
associated O
with O
the O
lighthearted O
gaiety O
of O
boyhood O
. O
The O
very O
winds O
whispered O
in O
soothing O
accents O
, O
and O
maternal O
Nature O
bade O
me O
weep O
no O
more O
. O
Then O
again O
the O
kindly O
influence O
ceased O
to O
act—I O
found O
myself O
fettered O
again O
to O
grief O
and O
indulging O
in O
all O
the O
misery O
of O
reflection O
. O
Then O
I O
spurred O
on O
my O
animal O
, O
striving O
so O
to O
forget O
the O
world O
, O
my O
fears O
, O
and O
more O
than O
all O
, O
myself—or O
, O
in O
a O
more O
desperate O
fashion O
, O
I O
alighted O
and O
threw O
myself O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
weighed O
down O
by O
horror O
and O
despair O
. O
At O
length O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
village O
of O
Chamounix O
. O
Exhaustion O
succeeded O
to O
the O
extreme O
fatigue O
both O
of O
body O
and O
of O
mind O
which O
I O
had O
endured O
. O
For O
a O
short O
space O
of O
time O
I O
remained O
at O
the O
window O
watching O
the O
pallid O
lightnings O
that O
played O
above O
Mont O
Blanc O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
rushing O
of O
the O
Arve O
, O
which O
pursued O
its O
noisy O
way O
beneath O
. O
The O
same O
lulling O
sounds O
acted O
as O
a O
lullaby O
to O
my O
too O
keen O
sensations O
; O
when O
I O
placed O
my O
head O
upon O
my O
pillow O
, O
sleep O
crept O
over O
me O
; O
I O
felt O
it O
as O
it O
came O
and O
blessed O
the O
giver O
of O
oblivion O
. O
