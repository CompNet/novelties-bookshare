" O
It O
is O
with O
considerable O
difficulty O
that O
I O
remember O
the O
original O
era O
of O
my O
being O
; O
all O
the O
events O
of O
that O
period O
appear O
confused O
and O
indistinct O
. O
A O
strange O
multiplicity O
of O
sensations O
seized O
me O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
, O
felt O
, O
heard O
, O
and O
smelt O
at O
the O
same O
time O
; O
and O
it O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
a O
long O
time O
before O
I O
learned O
to O
distinguish O
between O
the O
operations O
of O
my O
various O
senses O
. O
By O
degrees O
, O
I O
remember O
, O
a O
stronger O
light O
pressed O
upon O
my O
nerves O
, O
so O
that O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
shut O
my O
eyes O
. O
Darkness O
then O
came O
over O
me O
and O
troubled O
me O
, O
but O
hardly O
had O
I O
felt O
this O
when O
, O
by O
opening O
my O
eyes O
, O
as O
I O
now O
suppose O
, O
the O
light O
poured O
in O
upon O
me O
again O
. O
I O
walked O
and O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
descended O
, O
but O
I O
presently O
found O
a O
great O
alteration O
in O
my O
sensations O
. O
Before O
, O
dark O
and O
opaque O
bodies O
had O
surrounded O
me O
, O
impervious O
to O
my O
touch O
or O
sight O
; O
but O
I O
now O
found O
that O
I O
could O
wander O
on O
at O
liberty O
, O
with O
no O
obstacles O
which O
I O
could O
not O
either O
surmount O
or O
avoid O
. O
The O
light O
became O
more O
and O
more O
oppressive O
to O
me O
, O
and O
the O
heat O
wearying O
me O
as O
I O
walked O
, O
I O
sought O
a O
place O
where O
I O
could O
receive O
shade O
. O
This O
was O
the O
forest O
near O
Ingolstadt O
; O
and O
here O
I O
lay O
by O
the O
side O
of O
a O
brook O
resting O
from O
my O
fatigue O
, O
until O
I O
felt O
tormented O
by O
hunger O
and O
thirst O
. O
This O
roused O
me O
from O
my O
nearly O
dormant O
state O
, O
and O
I O
ate O
some O
berries O
which O
I O
found O
hanging O
on O
the O
trees O
or O
lying O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
I O
slaked O
my O
thirst O
at O
the O
brook O
, O
and O
then O
lying O
down O
, O
was O
overcome O
by O
sleep O
. O
" O
It O
was O
dark O
when O
I O
awoke O
; O
I O
felt O
cold O
also O
, O
and O
half O
frightened O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
instinctively O
, O
finding O
myself O
so O
desolate O
. O
Before O
I O
had O
quitted O
your O
apartment O
, O
on O
a O
sensation O
of O
cold O
, O
I O
had O
covered O
myself O
with O
some O
clothes O
, O
but O
these O
were O
insufficient O
to O
secure O
me O
from O
the O
dews O
of O
night O
. O
I O
was O
a O
poor O
, O
helpless O
, O
miserable O
wretch O
; O
I O
knew O
, O
and O
could O
distinguish O
, O
nothing O
; O
but O
feeling O
pain O
invade O
me O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
I O
sat O
down O
and O
wept O
. O
" O
Soon O
a O
gentle O
light O
stole O
over O
the O
heavens O
and O
gave O
me O
a O
sensation O
of O
pleasure O
. O
I O
started O
up O
and O
beheld O
a O
radiant O
form O
rise O
from O
among O
the O
trees O
. O
[ O
The O
moon O
] O
I O
gazed O
with O
a O
kind O
of O
wonder O
. O
It O
moved O
slowly O
, O
but O
it O
enlightened O
my O
path O
, O
and O
I O
again O
went O
out O
in O
search O
of O
berries O
. O
I O
was O
still O
cold O
when O
under O
one O
of O
the O
trees O
I O
found O
a O
huge O
cloak O
, O
with O
which O
I O
covered O
myself O
, O
and O
sat O
down O
upon O
the O
ground O
. O
No O
distinct O
ideas O
occupied O
my O
mind O
; O
all O
was O
confused O
. O
I O
felt O
light O
, O
and O
hunger O
, O
and O
thirst O
, O
and O
darkness O
; O
innumerable O
sounds O
rang O
in O
my O
ears O
, O
and O
on O
all O
sides O
various O
scents O
saluted O
me O
; O
the O
only O
object O
that O
I O
could O
distinguish O
was O
the O
bright O
moon O
, O
and O
I O
fixed O
my O
eyes O
on O
that O
with O
pleasure O
. O
" O
Several O
changes O
of O
day O
and O
night O
passed O
, O
and O
the O
orb O
of O
night O
had O
greatly O
lessened O
, O
when O
I O
began O
to O
distinguish O
my O
sensations O
from O
each O
other O
. O
I O
gradually O
saw O
plainly O
the O
clear O
stream O
that O
supplied O
me O
with O
drink O
and O
the O
trees O
that O
shaded O
me O
with O
their O
foliage O
. O
I O
was O
delighted O
when O
I O
first O
discovered O
that O
a O
pleasant O
sound O
, O
which O
often O
saluted O
my O
ears O
, O
proceeded O
from O
the O
throats O
of O
the O
little O
winged O
animals O
who O
had O
often O
intercepted O
the O
light O
from O
my O
eyes O
. O
I O
began O
also O
to O
observe O
, O
with O
greater O
accuracy O
, O
the O
forms O
that O
surrounded O
me O
and O
to O
perceive O
the O
boundaries O
of O
the O
radiant O
roof O
of O
light O
which O
canopied O
me O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
tried O
to O
imitate O
the O
pleasant O
songs O
of O
the O
birds O
but O
was O
unable O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
wished O
to O
express O
my O
sensations O
in O
my O
own O
mode O
, O
but O
the O
uncouth O
and O
inarticulate O
sounds O
which O
broke O
from O
me O
frightened O
me O
into O
silence O
again O
. O
" O
The O
moon O
had O
disappeared O
from O
the O
night O
, O
and O
again O
, O
with O
a O
lessened O
form O
, O
showed O
itself O
, O
while O
I O
still O
remained O
in O
the O
forest O
. O
My O
sensations O
had O
by O
this O
time O
become O
distinct O
, O
and O
my O
mind O
received O
every O
day O
additional O
ideas O
. O
My O
eyes O
became O
accustomed O
to O
the O
light O
and O
to O
perceive O
objects O
in O
their O
right O
forms O
; O
I O
distinguished O
the O
insect O
from O
the O
herb O
, O
and O
by O
degrees O
, O
one O
herb O
from O
another O
. O
I O
found O
that O
the O
sparrow O
uttered O
none O
but O
harsh O
notes O
, O
whilst O
those O
of O
the O
blackbird O
and O
thrush O
were O
sweet O
and O
enticing O
. O
" O
One O
day O
, O
when O
I O
was O
oppressed O
by O
cold O
, O
I O
found O
a O
fire O
which O
had O
been O
left O
by O
some O
wandering O
beggars O
, O
and O
was O
overcome O
with O
delight O
at O
the O
warmth O
I O
experienced O
from O
it O
. O
In O
my O
joy O
I O
thrust O
my O
hand O
into O
the O
live O
embers O
, O
but O
quickly O
drew O
it O
out O
again O
with O
a O
cry O
of O
pain O
. O
How O
strange O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
that O
the O
same O
cause O
should O
produce O
such O
opposite O
effects O
! O
I O
examined O
the O
materials O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
to O
my O
joy O
found O
it O
to O
be O
composed O
of O
wood O
. O
I O
quickly O
collected O
some O
branches O
, O
but O
they O
were O
wet O
and O
would O
not O
burn O
. O
I O
was O
pained O
at O
this O
and O
sat O
still O
watching O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
fire O
. O
The O
wet O
wood O
which O
I O
had O
placed O
near O
the O
heat O
dried O
and O
itself O
became O
inflamed O
. O
I O
reflected O
on O
this O
, O
and O
by O
touching O
the O
various O
branches O
, O
I O
discovered O
the O
cause O
and O
busied O
myself O
in O
collecting O
a O
great O
quantity O
of O
wood O
, O
that O
I O
might O
dry O
it O
and O
have O
a O
plentiful O
supply O
of O
fire O
. O
When O
night O
came O
on O
and O
brought O
sleep O
with O
it O
, O
I O
was O
in O
the O
greatest O
fear O
lest O
my O
fire O
should O
be O
extinguished O
. O
I O
covered O
it O
carefully O
with O
dry O
wood O
and O
leaves O
and O
placed O
wet O
branches O
upon O
it O
; O
and O
then O
, O
spreading O
my O
cloak O
, O
I O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
and O
sank O
into O
sleep O
. O
" O
It O
was O
morning O
when O
I O
awoke O
, O
and O
my O
first O
care O
was O
to O
visit O
the O
fire O
. O
I O
uncovered O
it O
, O
and O
a O
gentle O
breeze O
quickly O
fanned O
it O
into O
a O
flame O
. O
I O
observed O
this O
also O
and O
contrived O
a O
fan O
of O
branches O
, O
which O
roused O
the O
embers O
when O
they O
were O
nearly O
extinguished O
. O
When O
night O
came O
again O
I O
found O
, O
with O
pleasure O
, O
that O
the O
fire O
gave O
light O
as O
well O
as O
heat O
and O
that O
the O
discovery O
of O
this O
element O
was O
useful O
to O
me O
in O
my O
food O
, O
for O
I O
found O
some O
of O
the O
offals O
that O
the O
travellers O
had O
left O
had O
been O
roasted O
, O
and O
tasted O
much O
more O
savoury O
than O
the O
berries O
I O
gathered O
from O
the O
trees O
. O
I O
tried O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
dress O
my O
food O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
, O
placing O
it O
on O
the O
live O
embers O
. O
I O
found O
that O
the O
berries O
were O
spoiled O
by O
this O
operation O
, O
and O
the O
nuts O
and O
roots O
much O
improved O
. O
" O
Food O
, O
however O
, O
became O
scarce O
, O
and O
I O
often O
spent O
the O
whole O
day O
searching O
in O
vain O
for O
a O
few O
acorns O
to O
assuage O
the O
pangs O
of O
hunger O
. O
When O
I O
found O
this O
, O
I O
resolved O
to O
quit O
the O
place O
that O
I O
had O
hitherto O
inhabited O
, O
to O
seek O
for O
one O
where O
the O
few O
wants O
I O
experienced O
would O
be O
more O
easily O
satisfied O
. O
In O
this O
emigration O
I O
exceedingly O
lamented O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
fire O
which O
I O
had O
obtained O
through O
accident O
and O
knew O
not O
how O
to O
reproduce O
it O
. O
I O
gave O
several O
hours O
to O
the O
serious O
consideration O
of O
this O
difficulty O
, O
but O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
relinquish O
all O
attempt O
to O
supply O
it O
, O
and O
wrapping O
myself O
up O
in O
my O
cloak O
, O
I O
struck O
across O
the O
wood O
towards O
the O
setting O
sun O
. O
I O
passed O
three O
days O
in O
these O
rambles O
and O
at O
length O
discovered O
the O
open O
country O
. O
A O
great O
fall O
of O
snow O
had O
taken O
place O
the O
night O
before O
, O
and O
the O
fields O
were O
of O
one O
uniform O
white O
; O
the O
appearance O
was O
disconsolate O
, O
and O
I O
found O
my O
feet O
chilled O
by O
the O
cold O
damp O
substance O
that O
covered O
the O
ground O
. O
" O
It O
was O
about O
seven O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
I O
longed O
to O
obtain O
food O
and O
shelter O
; O
at O
length O
I O
perceived O
a O
small O
hut O
, O
on O
a O
rising O
ground O
, O
which O
had O
doubtless O
been O
built O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
some O
shepherd O
. O
This O
was O
a O
new O
sight O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
examined O
the O
structure O
with O
great O
curiosity O
. O
Finding O
the O
door O
open O
, O
I O
entered O
. O
An O
old O
man O
sat O
in O
it O
, O
near O
a O
fire O
, O
over O
which O
he O
was O
preparing O
his O
breakfast O
. O
He O
turned O
on O
hearing O
a O
noise O
, O
and O
perceiving O
me O
, O
shrieked O
loudly O
, O
and O
quitting O
the O
hut O
, O
ran O
across O
the O
fields O
with O
a O
speed O
of O
which O
his O
debilitated O
form O
hardly O
appeared O
capable O
. O
His O
appearance O
, O
different O
from O
any O
I O
had O
ever O
before O
seen O
, O
and O
his O
flight O
somewhat O
surprised O
me O
. O
But O
I O
was O
enchanted O
by O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
hut O
; O
here O
the O
snow O
and O
rain O
could O
not O
penetrate O
; O
the O
ground O
was O
dry O
; O
and O
it O
presented O
to O
me O
then O
as O
exquisite O
and O
divine O
a O
retreat O
as O
Pandæmonium O
appeared O
to O
the O
dæmons O
of O
hell O
after O
their O
sufferings O
in O
the O
lake O
of O
fire O
. O
I O
greedily O
devoured O
the O
remnants O
of O
the O
shepherd O
's O
breakfast O
, O
which O
consisted O
of O
bread O
, O
cheese O
, O
milk O
, O
and O
wine O
; O
the O
latter O
, O
however O
, O
I O
did O
not O
like O
. O
Then O
, O
overcome O
by O
fatigue O
, O
I O
lay O
down O
among O
some O
straw O
and O
fell O
asleep O
. O
" O
It O
was O
noon O
when O
I O
awoke O
, O
and O
allured O
by O
the O
warmth O
of O
the O
sun O
, O
which O
shone O
brightly O
on O
the O
white O
ground O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
recommence O
my O
travels O
; O
and O
, O
depositing O
the O
remains O
of O
the O
peasant O
's O
breakfast O
in O
a O
wallet O
I O
found O
, O
I O
proceeded O
across O
the O
fields O
for O
several O
hours O
, O
until O
at O
sunset O
I O
arrived O
at O
a O
village O
. O
How O
miraculous O
did O
this O
appear O
! O
The O
huts O
, O
the O
neater O
cottages O
, O
and O
stately O
houses O
engaged O
my O
admiration O
by O
turns O
. O
The O
vegetables O
in O
the O
gardens O
, O
the O
milk O
and O
cheese O
that O
I O
saw O
placed O
at O
the O
windows O
of O
some O
of O
the O
cottages O
, O
allured O
my O
appetite O
. O
One O
of O
the O
best O
of O
these O
I O
entered O
, O
but O
I O
had O
hardly O
placed O
my O
foot O
within O
the O
door O
before O
the O
children O
shrieked O
, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
women O
fainted O
. O
The O
whole O
village O
was O
roused O
; O
some O
fled O
, O
some O
attacked O
me O
, O
until O
, O
grievously O
bruised O
by O
stones O
and O
many O
other O
kinds O
of O
missile O
weapons O
, O
I O
escaped O
to O
the O
open O
country O
and O
fearfully O
took O
refuge O
in O
a O
low O
hovel O
, O
quite O
bare O
, O
and O
making O
a O
wretched O
appearance O
after O
the O
palaces O
I O
had O
beheld O
in O
the O
village O
. O
This O
hovel O
however O
, O
joined O
a O
cottage O
of O
a O
neat O
and O
pleasant O
appearance O
, O
but O
after O
my O
late O
dearly O
bought O
experience O
, O
I O
dared O
not O
enter O
it O
. O
My O
place O
of O
refuge O
was O
constructed O
of O
wood O
, O
but O
so O
low O
that O
I O
could O
with O
difficulty O
sit O
upright O
in O
it O
. O
No O
wood O
, O
however O
, O
was O
placed O
on O
the O
earth O
, O
which O
formed O
the O
floor O
, O
but O
it O
was O
dry O
; O
and O
although O
the O
wind O
entered O
it O
by O
innumerable O
chinks O
, O
I O
found O
it O
an O
agreeable O
asylum O
from O
the O
snow O
and O
rain O
. O
" O
Here O
, O
then O
, O
I O
retreated O
and O
lay O
down O
happy O
to O
have O
found O
a O
shelter O
, O
however O
miserable O
, O
from O
the O
inclemency O
of O
the O
season O
, O
and O
still O
more O
from O
the O
barbarity O
of O
man O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
morning O
dawned O
I O
crept O
from O
my O
kennel O
, O
that O
I O
might O
view O
the O
adjacent O
cottage O
and O
discover O
if O
I O
could O
remain O
in O
the O
habitation O
I O
had O
found O
. O
It O
was O
situated O
against O
the O
back O
of O
the O
cottage O
and O
surrounded O
on O
the O
sides O
which O
were O
exposed O
by O
a O
pig O
sty O
and O
a O
clear O
pool O
of O
water O
. O
One O
part O
was O
open O
, O
and O
by O
that O
I O
had O
crept O
in O
; O
but O
now O
I O
covered O
every O
crevice O
by O
which O
I O
might O
be O
perceived O
with O
stones O
and O
wood O
, O
yet O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
that O
I O
might O
move O
them O
on O
occasion O
to O
pass O
out O
; O
all O
the O
light O
I O
enjoyed O
came O
through O
the O
sty O
, O
and O
that O
was O
sufficient O
for O
me O
. O
" O
Having O
thus O
arranged O
my O
dwelling O
and O
carpeted O
it O
with O
clean O
straw O
, O
I O
retired O
, O
for O
I O
saw O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
and O
I O
remembered O
too O
well O
my O
treatment O
the O
night O
before O
to O
trust O
myself O
in O
his O
power O
. O
I O
had O
first O
, O
however O
, O
provided O
for O
my O
sustenance O
for O
that O
day O
by O
a O
loaf O
of O
coarse O
bread O
, O
which O
I O
purloined O
, O
and O
a O
cup O
with O
which O
I O
could O
drink O
more O
conveniently O
than O
from O
my O
hand O
of O
the O
pure O
water O
which O
flowed O
by O
my O
retreat O
. O
The O
floor O
was O
a O
little O
raised O
, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
kept O
perfectly O
dry O
, O
and O
by O
its O
vicinity O
to O
the O
chimney O
of O
the O
cottage O
it O
was O
tolerably O
warm O
. O
" O
Being O
thus O
provided O
, O
I O
resolved O
to O
reside O
in O
this O
hovel O
until O
something O
should O
occur O
which O
might O
alter O
my O
determination O
. O
It O
was O
indeed O
a O
paradise O
compared O
to O
the O
bleak O
forest O
, O
my O
former O
residence O
, O
the O
rain-dropping O
branches O
, O
and O
dank O
earth O
. O
I O
ate O
my O
breakfast O
with O
pleasure O
and O
was O
about O
to O
remove O
a O
plank O
to O
procure O
myself O
a O
little O
water O
when O
I O
heard O
a O
step O
, O
and O
looking O
through O
a O
small O
chink O
, O
I O
beheld O
a O
young O
creature O
, O
with O
a O
pail O
on O
her O
head O
, O
passing O
before O
my O
hovel O
. O
The O
girl O
was O
young O
and O
of O
gentle O
demeanour O
, O
unlike O
what O
I O
have O
since O
found O
cottagers O
and O
farmhouse O
servants O
to O
be O
. O
Yet O
she O
was O
meanly O
dressed O
, O
a O
coarse O
blue O
petticoat O
and O
a O
linen O
jacket O
being O
her O
only O
garb O
; O
her O
fair O
hair O
was O
plaited O
but O
not O
adorned O
: O
she O
looked O
patient O
yet O
sad O
. O
I O
lost O
sight O
of O
her O
, O
and O
in O
about O
a O
quarter O
of O
an O
hour O
she O
returned O
bearing O
the O
pail O
, O
which O
was O
now O
partly O
filled O
with O
milk O
. O
As O
she O
walked O
along O
, O
seemingly O
incommoded O
by O
the O
burden O
, O
a O
young O
man O
met O
her O
, O
whose O
countenance O
expressed O
a O
deeper O
despondence O
. O
Uttering O
a O
few O
sounds O
with O
an O
air O
of O
melancholy O
, O
he O
took O
the O
pail O
from O
her O
head O
and O
bore O
it O
to O
the O
cottage O
himself O
. O
She O
followed O
, O
and O
they O
disappeared O
. O
Presently O
I O
saw O
the O
young O
man O
again O
, O
with O
some O
tools O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
cross O
the O
field O
behind O
the O
cottage O
; O
and O
the O
girl O
was O
also O
busied O
, O
sometimes O
in O
the O
house O
and O
sometimes O
in O
the O
yard O
. O
" O
On O
examining O
my O
dwelling O
, O
I O
found O
that O
one O
of O
the O
windows O
of O
the O
cottage O
had O
formerly O
occupied O
a O
part O
of O
it O
, O
but O
the O
panes O
had O
been O
filled O
up O
with O
wood O
. O
In O
one O
of O
these O
was O
a O
small O
and O
almost O
imperceptible O
chink O
through O
which O
the O
eye O
could O
just O
penetrate O
. O
Through O
this O
crevice O
a O
small O
room O
was O
visible O
, O
whitewashed O
and O
clean O
but O
very O
bare O
of O
furniture O
. O
In O
one O
corner O
, O
near O
a O
small O
fire O
, O
sat O
an O
old O
man O
, O
leaning O
his O
head O
on O
his O
hands O
in O
a O
disconsolate O
attitude O
. O
The O
young O
girl O
was O
occupied O
in O
arranging O
the O
cottage O
; O
but O
presently O
she O
took O
something O
out O
of O
a O
drawer O
, O
which O
employed O
her O
hands O
, O
and O
she O
sat O
down O
beside O
the O
old O
man O
, O
who O
, O
taking O
up O
an O
instrument O
, O
began O
to O
play O
and O
to O
produce O
sounds O
sweeter O
than O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
thrush O
or O
the O
nightingale O
. O
It O
was O
a O
lovely O
sight O
, O
even O
to O
me O
, O
poor O
wretch O
who O
had O
never O
beheld O
aught O
beautiful O
before O
. O
The O
silver O
hair O
and O
benevolent O
countenance O
of O
the O
aged O
cottager O
won O
my O
reverence O
, O
while O
the O
gentle O
manners O
of O
the O
girl O
enticed O
my O
love O
. O
He O
played O
a O
sweet O
mournful O
air O
which O
I O
perceived O
drew O
tears O
from O
the O
eyes O
of O
his O
amiable O
companion O
, O
of O
which O
the O
old O
man O
took O
no O
notice O
, O
until O
she O
sobbed O
audibly O
; O
he O
then O
pronounced O
a O
few O
sounds O
, O
and O
the O
fair O
creature O
, O
leaving O
her O
work O
, O
knelt O
at O
his O
feet O
. O
He O
raised O
her O
and O
smiled O
with O
such O
kindness O
and O
affection O
that O
I O
felt O
sensations O
of O
a O
peculiar O
and O
overpowering O
nature O
; O
they O
were O
a O
mixture O
of O
pain O
and O
pleasure O
, O
such O
as O
I O
had O
never O
before O
experienced O
, O
either O
from O
hunger O
or O
cold O
, O
warmth O
or O
food O
; O
and O
I O
withdrew O
from O
the O
window O
, O
unable O
to O
bear O
these O
emotions O
. O
" O
Soon O
after O
this O
the O
young O
man O
returned O
, O
bearing O
on O
his O
shoulders O
a O
load O
of O
wood O
. O
The O
girl O
met O
him O
at O
the O
door O
, O
helped O
to O
relieve O
him O
of O
his O
burden O
, O
and O
taking O
some O
of O
the O
fuel O
into O
the O
cottage O
, O
placed O
it O
on O
the O
fire O
; O
then O
she O
and O
the O
youth O
went O
apart O
into O
a O
nook O
of O
the O
cottage O
, O
and O
he O
showed O
her O
a O
large O
loaf O
and O
a O
piece O
of O
cheese O
. O
She O
seemed O
pleased O
and O
went O
into O
the O
garden O
for O
some O
roots O
and O
plants O
, O
which O
she O
placed O
in O
water O
, O
and O
then O
upon O
the O
fire O
. O
She O
afterwards O
continued O
her O
work O
, O
whilst O
the O
young O
man O
went O
into O
the O
garden O
and O
appeared O
busily O
employed O
in O
digging O
and O
pulling O
up O
roots O
. O
After O
he O
had O
been O
employed O
thus O
about O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
young O
woman O
joined O
him O
and O
they O
entered O
the O
cottage O
together O
. O
" O
The O
old O
man O
had O
, O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
been O
pensive O
, O
but O
on O
the O
appearance O
of O
his O
companions O
he O
assumed O
a O
more O
cheerful O
air O
, O
and O
they O
sat O
down O
to O
eat O
. O
The O
meal O
was O
quickly O
dispatched O
. O
The O
young O
woman O
was O
again O
occupied O
in O
arranging O
the O
cottage O
, O
the O
old O
man O
walked O
before O
the O
cottage O
in O
the O
sun O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
leaning O
on O
the O
arm O
of O
the O
youth O
. O
Nothing O
could O
exceed O
in O
beauty O
the O
contrast O
between O
these O
two O
excellent O
creatures O
. O
One O
was O
old O
, O
with O
silver O
hairs O
and O
a O
countenance O
beaming O
with O
benevolence O
and O
love O
; O
the O
younger O
was O
slight O
and O
graceful O
in O
his O
figure O
, O
and O
his O
features O
were O
moulded O
with O
the O
finest O
symmetry O
, O
yet O
his O
eyes O
and O
attitude O
expressed O
the O
utmost O
sadness O
and O
despondency O
. O
The O
old O
man O
returned O
to O
the O
cottage O
, O
and O
the O
youth O
, O
with O
tools O
different O
from O
those O
he O
had O
used O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
directed O
his O
steps O
across O
the O
fields O
. O
" O
Night O
quickly O
shut O
in O
, O
but O
to O
my O
extreme O
wonder O
, O
I O
found O
that O
the O
cottagers O
had O
a O
means O
of O
prolonging O
light O
by O
the O
use O
of O
tapers O
, O
and O
was O
delighted O
to O
find O
that O
the O
setting O
of O
the O
sun O
did O
not O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
pleasure O
I O
experienced O
in O
watching O
my O
human O
neighbours O
. O
In O
the O
evening O
the O
young O
girl O
and O
her O
companion O
were O
employed O
in O
various O
occupations O
which O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
; O
and O
the O
old O
man O
again O
took O
up O
the O
instrument O
which O
produced O
the O
divine O
sounds O
that O
had O
enchanted O
me O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
So O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
finished O
, O
the O
youth O
began O
, O
not O
to O
play O
, O
but O
to O
utter O
sounds O
that O
were O
monotonous O
, O
and O
neither O
resembling O
the O
harmony O
of O
the O
old O
man O
's O
instrument O
nor O
the O
songs O
of O
the O
birds O
; O
I O
since O
found O
that O
he O
read O
aloud O
, O
but O
at O
that O
time O
I O
knew O
nothing O
of O
the O
science O
of O
words O
or O
letters O
. O
" O
The O
family O
, O
after O
having O
been O
thus O
occupied O
for O
a O
short O
time O
, O
extinguished O
their O
lights O
and O
retired O
, O
as O
I O
conjectured O
, O
to O
rest O
. O
