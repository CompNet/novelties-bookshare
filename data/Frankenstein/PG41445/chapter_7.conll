From O
this O
day O
natural O
philosophy O
, O
and O
particularly O
chemistry O
, O
in O
the O
most O
comprehensive O
sense O
of O
the O
term O
, O
became O
nearly O
my O
sole O
occupation O
. O
I O
read O
with O
ardour O
those O
works O
, O
so O
full O
of O
genius O
and O
discrimination O
, O
which O
modern O
inquirers O
have O
written O
on O
these O
subjects O
. O
I O
attended O
the O
lectures O
, O
and O
cultivated O
the O
acquaintance O
, O
of O
the O
men O
of O
science O
of O
the O
university O
; O
and O
I O
found O
even O
in O
M. O
Krempe O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
sound O
sense O
and O
real O
information O
, O
combined O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
with O
a O
repulsive O
physiognomy O
and O
manners O
, O
but O
not O
on O
that O
account O
the O
less O
valuable O
. O
In O
M. O
Waldman O
I O
found O
a O
true O
friend O
. O
His O
gentleness O
was O
never O
tinged O
by O
dogmatism O
; O
and O
his O
instructions O
were O
given O
with O
an O
air O
of O
frankness O
and O
good O
nature O
, O
that O
banished O
every O
idea O
of O
pedantry O
. O
It O
was O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
amiable O
character O
of O
this O
man O
that O
inclined O
me O
more O
to O
that O
branch O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
which O
he O
professed O
, O
than O
an O
intrinsic O
love O
for O
the O
science O
itself O
. O
But O
this O
state O
of O
mind O
had O
place O
only O
in O
the O
first O
steps O
towards O
knowledge O
: O
the O
more O
fully O
I O
entered O
into O
the O
science O
, O
the O
more O
exclusively O
I O
pursued O
it O
for O
its O
own O
sake O
. O
That O
application O
, O
which O
at O
first O
had O
been O
a O
matter O
of O
duty O
and O
resolution O
, O
now O
became O
so O
ardent O
and O
eager O
, O
that O
the O
stars O
often O
disappeared O
in O
the O
light O
of O
morning O
whilst O
I O
was O
yet O
engaged O
in O
my O
laboratory O
. O
As O
I O
applied O
so O
closely O
, O
it O
may O
be O
easily O
conceived O
that O
I O
improved O
rapidly O
. O
My O
ardour O
was O
indeed O
the O
astonishment O
of O
the O
students O
; O
and O
my O
proficiency O
, O
that O
of O
the O
masters O
. O
Professor O
Krempe O
often O
asked O
me O
, O
with O
a O
sly O
smile O
, O
how O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
went O
on O
? O
whilst O
M. O
Waldman O
expressed O
the O
most O
heart-felt O
exultation O
in O
my O
progress O
. O
Two O
years O
passed O
in O
this O
manner O
, O
during O
which O
I O
paid O
no O
visit O
to O
Geneva O
, O
but O
was O
engaged O
, O
heart O
and O
soul O
, O
in O
the O
pursuit O
of O
some O
discoveries O
, O
which O
I O
hoped O
to O
make O
. O
None O
but O
those O
who O
have O
experienced O
them O
can O
conceive O
of O
the O
enticements O
of O
science O
. O
In O
other O
studies O
you O
go O
as O
far O
as O
others O
have O
gone O
before O
you O
, O
and O
there O
is O
nothing O
more O
to O
know O
; O
but O
in O
a O
scientific O
pursuit O
there O
is O
continual O
food O
for O
discovery O
and O
wonder O
. O
A O
mind O
of O
moderate O
capacity O
, O
which O
closely O
pursues O
one O
study O
, O
must O
infallibly O
arrive O
at O
great O
proficiency O
in O
that O
study O
; O
and O
I O
, O
who O
continually O
sought O
the O
attainment O
of O
one O
object O
of O
pursuit O
, O
and O
was O
solely O
wrapt O
up O
in O
this O
, O
improved O
so O
rapidly O
, O
that O
, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
two O
years O
, O
I O
made O
some O
discoveries O
in O
the O
improvement O
of O
some O
chemical O
instruments O
, O
which O
procured O
me O
great O
esteem O
and O
admiration O
at O
the O
university O
. O
When O
I O
had O
arrived O
at O
this O
point O
, O
and O
had O
become O
as O
well O
acquainted O
with O
the O
theory O
and O
practice O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
as O
depended O
on O
the O
lessons O
of O
any O
of O
the O
professors O
at O
Ingolstadt O
, O
my O
residence O
there O
being O
no O
longer O
conducive O
to O
my O
improvements O
, O
I O
thought O
of O
returning O
to O
my O
friends O
and O
my O
native O
town O
, O
when O
an O
incident O
happened O
that O
protracted O
my O
stay O
. O
One O
of O
the O
phænonema O
which O
had O
peculiarly O
attracted O
my O
attention O
was O
the O
structure O
of O
the O
human O
frame O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
any O
animal O
endued O
with O
life O
. O
Whence O
, O
I O
often O
asked O
myself O
, O
did O
the O
principle O
of O
life O
proceed O
? O
It O
was O
a O
bold O
question O
, O
and O
one O
which O
has O
ever O
been O
considered O
as O
a O
mystery O
; O
yet O
with O
how O
many O
things O
are O
we O
upon O
the O
brink O
of O
becoming O
acquainted O
, O
if O
cowardice O
or O
carelessness O
did O
not O
restrain O
our O
inquiries O
. O
I O
revolved O
these O
circumstances O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
determined O
thenceforth O
to O
apply O
myself O
more O
particularly O
to O
those O
branches O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
which O
relate O
to O
physiology O
. O
Unless O
I O
had O
been O
animated O
by O
an O
almost O
supernatural O
enthusiasm O
, O
my O
application O
to O
this O
study O
would O
have O
been O
irksome O
, O
and O
almost O
intolerable O
. O
To O
examine O
the O
causes O
of O
life O
, O
we O
must O
first O
have O
recourse O
to O
death O
. O
I O
became O
acquainted O
with O
the O
science O
of O
anatomy O
: O
but O
this O
was O
not O
sufficient O
; O
I O
must O
also O
observe O
the O
natural O
decay O
and O
corruption O
of O
the O
human O
body O
. O
In O
my O
education O
my O
father O
had O
taken O
the O
greatest O
precautions O
that O
my O
mind O
should O
be O
impressed O
with O
no O
supernatural O
horrors O
. O
I O
do O
not O
ever O
remember O
to O
have O
trembled O
at O
a O
tale O
of O
superstition O
, O
or O
to O
have O
feared O
the O
apparition O
of O
a O
spirit O
. O
Darkness O
had O
no O
effect O
upon O
my O
fancy O
; O
and O
a O
church-yard O
was O
to O
me O
merely O
the O
receptacle O
of O
bodies O
deprived O
of O
life O
, O
which O
, O
from O
being O
the O
seat O
of O
beauty O
and O
strength O
, O
had O
become O
food O
for O
the O
worm O
. O
Now O
I O
was O
led O
to O
examine O
the O
cause O
and O
progress O
of O
this O
decay O
, O
and O
forced O
to O
spend O
days O
and O
nights O
in O
vaults O
and O
charnel O
houses O
. O
My O
attention O
was O
fixed O
upon O
every O
object O
the O
most O
insupportable O
to O
the O
delicacy O
of O
the O
human O
feelings O
. O
I O
saw O
how O
the O
fine O
form O
of O
man O
was O
degraded O
and O
wasted O
; O
I O
beheld O
the O
corruption O
of O
death O
succeed O
to O
the O
blooming O
cheek O
of O
life O
; O
I O
saw O
how O
the O
worm O
inherited O
the O
wonders O
of O
the O
eye O
and O
brain O
. O
I O
paused O
, O
examining O
and O
analysing O
all O
the O
minutiæ O
of O
causation O
, O
as O
exemplified O
in O
the O
change O
from O
life O
to O
death O
, O
and O
death O
to O
life O
, O
until O
from O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
darkness O
a O
sudden O
light O
broke O
in O
upon O
me—a O
light O
so O
brilliant O
and O
wondrous O
, O
yet O
so O
simple O
, O
that O
while O
I O
became O
dizzy O
with O
the O
immensity O
of O
the O
prospect O
which O
it O
illustrated O
, O
I O
was O
surprised O
that O
among O
so O
many O
men O
of O
genius O
, O
who O
had O
directed O
their O
inquiries O
towards O
the O
same O
science O
, O
that O
I O
alone O
should O
be O
reserved O
to O
discover O
so O
astonishing O
a O
secret O
. O
Remember O
, O
I O
am O
not O
recording O
the O
vision O
of O
a O
madman O
. O
The O
sun O
does O
not O
more O
certainly O
shine O
in O
the O
heavens O
, O
than O
that O
which O
I O
now O
affirm O
is O
true O
. O
Some O
miracle O
might O
have O
produced O
it O
, O
yet O
the O
stages O
of O
the O
discovery O
were O
distinct O
and O
probable O
. O
After O
days O
and O
nights O
of O
incredible O
labour O
and O
fatigue O
, O
I O
succeeded O
in O
discovering O
the O
cause O
of O
generation O
and O
life O
; O
nay O
, O
more O
, O
I O
became O
myself O
capable O
of O
bestowing O
animation O
upon O
lifeless O
matter O
. O
The O
astonishment O
which O
I O
had O
at O
first O
experienced O
on O
this O
discovery O
soon O
gave O
place O
to O
delight O
and O
rapture O
. O
After O
so O
much O
time O
spent O
in O
painful O
labour O
, O
to O
arrive O
at O
once O
at O
the O
summit O
of O
my O
desires O
, O
was O
the O
most O
gratifying O
consummation O
of O
my O
toils O
. O
But O
this O
discovery O
was O
so O
great O
and O
overwhelming O
, O
that O
all O
the O
steps O
by O
which O
I O
had O
been O
progressively O
led O
to O
it O
were O
obliterated O
, O
and O
I O
beheld O
only O
the O
result O
. O
What O
had O
been O
the O
study O
and O
desire O
of O
the O
wisest O
men O
since O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
world O
, O
was O
now O
within O
my O
grasp O
. O
Not O
that O
, O
like O
a O
magic O
scene O
, O
it O
all O
opened O
upon O
me O
at O
once O
: O
the O
information O
I O
had O
obtained O
was O
of O
a O
nature O
rather O
to O
direct O
my O
endeavours O
so O
soon O
as O
I O
should O
point O
them O
towards O
the O
object O
of O
my O
search O
, O
than O
to O
exhibit O
that O
object O
already O
accomplished O
. O
I O
was O
like O
the O
Arabian O
who O
had O
been O
buried O
with O
the O
dead O
, O
and O
found O
a O
passage O
to O
life O
aided O
only O
by O
one O
glimmering O
, O
and O
seemingly O
ineffectual O
light O
. O
I O
see O
by O
your O
eagerness O
, O
and O
the O
wonder O
and O
hope O
which O
your O
eyes O
express O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
that O
you O
expect O
to O
be O
informed O
of O
the O
secret O
with O
which O
I O
am O
acquainted O
; O
that O
can O
not O
be O
: O
listen O
patiently O
until O
the O
end O
of O
my O
story O
, O
and O
you O
will O
easily O
perceive O
why O
I O
am O
reserved O
upon O
that O
subject O
. O
I O
will O
not O
lead O
you O
on O
, O
unguarded O
and O
ardent O
as O
I O
then O
was O
, O
to O
your O
destruction O
and O
infallible O
misery O
. O
Learn O
from O
me O
, O
if O
not O
by O
my O
precepts O
, O
at O
least O
by O
my O
example O
, O
how O
dangerous O
is O
the O
acquirement O
of O
knowledge O
, O
and O
how O
much O
happier O
that O
man O
is O
who O
believes O
his O
native O
town O
to O
be O
the O
world O
, O
than O
he O
who O
aspires O
to O
become O
greater O
than O
his O
nature O
will O
allow O
. O
When O
I O
found O
so O
astonishing O
a O
power O
placed O
within O
my O
hands O
, O
I O
hesitated O
a O
long O
time O
concerning O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
I O
should O
employ O
it O
. O
Although O
I O
possessed O
the O
capacity O
of O
bestowing O
animation O
, O
yet O
to O
prepare O
a O
frame O
for O
the O
reception O
of O
it O
, O
with O
all O
its O
intricacies O
of O
fibres O
, O
muscles O
, O
and O
veins O
, O
still O
remained O
a O
work O
of O
inconceivable O
difficulty O
and O
labour O
. O
I O
doubted O
at O
first O
whether O
I O
should O
attempt O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
being O
like O
myself O
or O
one O
of O
simpler O
organization O
; O
but O
my O
imagination O
was O
too O
much O
exalted O
by O
my O
first O
success O
to O
permit O
me O
to O
doubt O
of O
my O
ability O
to O
give O
life O
to O
an O
animal O
as O
complex O
and O
wonderful O
as O
man O
. O
The O
materials O
at O
present O
within O
my O
command O
hardly O
appeared O
adequate O
to O
so O
arduous O
an O
undertaking O
; O
but O
I O
doubted O
not O
that O
I O
should O
ultimately O
succeed O
. O
I O
prepared O
myself O
for O
a O
multitude O
of O
reverses O
; O
my O
operations O
might O
be O
incessantly O
baffled O
, O
and O
at O
last O
my O
work O
be O
imperfect O
: O
yet O
, O
when O
I O
considered O
the O
improvement O
which O
every O
day O
takes O
place O
in O
science O
and O
mechanics O
, O
I O
was O
encouraged O
to O
hope O
my O
present O
attempts O
would O
at O
least O
lay O
the O
foundations O
of O
future O
success O
. O
Nor O
could O
I O
consider O
the O
magnitude O
and O
complexity O
of O
my O
plan O
as O
any O
argument O
of O
its O
impracticability O
. O
It O
was O
with O
these O
feelings O
that O
I O
began O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
human O
being O
. O
As O
the O
minuteness O
of O
the O
parts O
formed O
a O
great O
hindrance O
to O
my O
speed O
, O
I O
resolved O
, O
contrary O
to O
my O
first O
intention O
, O
to O
make O
the O
being O
of O
a O
gigantic O
stature O
; O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
about O
eight O
feet O
in O
height O
, O
and O
proportionably O
large O
. O
After O
having O
formed O
this O
determination O
, O
and O
having O
spent O
some O
months O
in O
successfully O
collecting O
and O
arranging O
my O
materials O
, O
I O
began O
. O
No O
one O
can O
conceive O
the O
variety O
of O
feelings O
which O
bore O
me O
onwards O
, O
like O
a O
hurricane O
, O
in O
the O
first O
enthusiasm O
of O
success O
. O
Life O
and O
death O
appeared O
to O
me O
ideal O
bounds O
, O
which O
I O
should O
first O
break O
through O
, O
and O
pour O
a O
torrent O
of O
light O
into O
our O
dark O
world O
. O
A O
new O
species O
would O
bless O
me O
as O
its O
creator O
and O
source O
; O
many O
happy O
and O
excellent O
natures O
would O
owe O
their O
being O
to O
me O
. O
No O
father O
could O
claim O
the O
gratitude O
of O
his O
child O
so O
completely O
as O
I O
should O
deserve O
their O
's O
. O
Pursuing O
these O
reflections O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
that O
if O
I O
could O
bestow O
animation O
upon O
lifeless O
matter O
, O
I O
might O
in O
process O
of O
time O
( O
although O
I O
now O
found O
it O
impossible O
) O
renew O
life O
where O
death O
had O
apparently O
devoted O
the O
body O
to O
corruption O
. O
These O
thoughts O
supported O
my O
spirits O
, O
while O
I O
pursued O
my O
undertaking O
with O
unremitting O
ardour O
. O
My O
cheek O
had O
grown O
pale O
with O
study O
, O
and O
my O
person O
had O
become O
emaciated O
with O
confinement O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
on O
the O
very O
brink O
of O
certainty O
, O
I O
failed O
; O
yet O
still O
I O
clung O
to O
the O
hope O
which O
the O
next O
day O
or O
the O
next O
hour O
might O
realize O
. O
One O
secret O
which O
I O
alone O
possessed O
was O
the O
hope O
to O
which O
I O
had O
dedicated O
myself O
; O
and O
the O
moon O
gazed O
on O
my O
midnight O
labours O
, O
while O
, O
with O
unrelaxed O
and O
breathless O
eagerness O
, O
I O
pursued O
nature O
to O
her O
hiding O
places O
. O
Who O
shall O
conceive O
the O
horrors O
of O
my O
secret O
toil O
, O
as O
I O
dabbled O
among O
the O
unhallowed O
damps O
of O
the O
grave O
, O
or O
tortured O
the O
living O
animal O
to O
animate O
the O
lifeless O
clay O
? O
My O
limbs O
now O
tremble O
, O
and O
my O
eyes O
swim O
with O
the O
remembrance O
; O
but O
then O
a O
resistless O
, O
and O
almost O
frantic O
impulse O
, O
urged O
me O
forward O
; O
I O
seemed O
to O
have O
lost O
all O
soul O
or O
sensation O
but O
for O
this O
one O
pursuit O
. O
It O
was O
indeed O
but O
a O
passing O
trance O
, O
that O
only O
made O
me O
feel O
with O
renewed O
acuteness O
so O
soon O
as O
, O
the O
unnatural O
stimulus O
ceasing O
to O
operate O
, O
I O
had O
returned O
to O
my O
old O
habits O
. O
I O
collected O
bones O
from O
charnel O
houses O
; O
and O
disturbed O
, O
with O
profane O
fingers O
, O
the O
tremendous O
secrets O
of O
the O
human O
frame O
. O
In O
a O
solitary O
chamber O
, O
or O
rather O
cell O
, O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
house O
, O
and O
separated O
from O
all O
the O
other O
apartments O
by O
a O
gallery O
and O
staircase O
, O
I O
kept O
my O
workshop O
of O
filthy O
creation O
; O
my O
eyeballs O
were O
starting O
from O
their O
sockets O
in O
attending O
to O
the O
details O
of O
my O
employment O
. O
The O
dissecting O
room O
and O
the O
slaughter-house O
furnished O
many O
of O
my O
materials O
; O
and O
often O
did O
my O
human O
nature O
turn O
with O
loathing O
from O
my O
occupation O
, O
whilst O
, O
still O
urged O
on O
by O
an O
eagerness O
which O
perpetually O
increased O
, O
I O
brought O
my O
work O
near O
to O
a O
conclusion O
. O
The O
summer O
months O
passed O
while O
I O
was O
thus O
engaged O
, O
heart O
and O
soul O
, O
in O
one O
pursuit O
. O
It O
was O
a O
most O
beautiful O
season O
; O
never O
did O
the O
fields O
bestow O
a O
more O
plentiful O
harvest O
, O
or O
the O
vines O
yield O
a O
more O
luxuriant O
vintage O
: O
but O
my O
eyes O
were O
insensible O
to O
the O
charms O
of O
nature O
. O
And O
the O
same O
feelings O
which O
made O
me O
neglect O
the O
scenes O
around O
me O
caused O
me O
also O
to O
forget O
those O
friends O
who O
were O
so O
many O
miles O
absent O
, O
and O
whom O
I O
had O
not O
seen O
for O
so O
long O
a O
time O
. O
I O
knew O
my O
silence O
disquieted O
them O
; O
and O
I O
well O
remembered O
the O
words O
of O
my O
father O
: O
" O
I O
know O
that O
while O
you O
are O
pleased O
with O
yourself O
, O
you O
will O
think O
of O
us O
with O
affection O
, O
and O
we O
shall O
hear O
regularly O
from O
you O
. O
You O
must O
pardon O
me O
, O
if O
I O
regard O
any O
interruption O
in O
your O
correspondence O
as O
a O
proof O
that O
your O
other O
duties O
are O
equally O
neglected O
. O
" O
I O
knew O
well O
therefore O
what O
would O
be O
my O
father O
's O
feelings O
; O
but O
I O
could O
not O
tear O
my O
thoughts O
from O
my O
employment O
, O
loathsome O
in O
itself O
, O
but O
which O
had O
taken O
an O
irresistible O
hold O
of O
my O
imagination O
. O
I O
wished O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
to O
procrastinate O
all O
that O
related O
to O
my O
feelings O
of O
affection O
until O
the O
great O
object O
, O
which O
swallowed O
up O
every O
habit O
of O
my O
nature O
, O
should O
be O
completed O
. O
I O
then O
thought O
that O
my O
father O
would O
be O
unjust O
if O
he O
ascribed O
my O
neglect O
to O
vice O
, O
or O
faultiness O
on O
my O
part O
; O
but O
I O
am O
now O
convinced O
that O
he O
was O
justified O
in O
conceiving O
that O
I O
should O
not O
be O
altogether O
free O
from O
blame O
. O
A O
human O
being O
in O
perfection O
ought O
always O
to O
preserve O
a O
calm O
and O
peaceful O
mind O
, O
and O
never O
to O
allow O
passion O
or O
a O
transitory O
desire O
to O
disturb O
his O
tranquillity O
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
the O
pursuit O
of O
knowledge O
is O
an O
exception O
to O
this O
rule O
. O
If O
the O
study O
to O
which O
you O
apply O
yourself O
has O
a O
tendency O
to O
weaken O
your O
affections O
, O
and O
to O
destroy O
your O
taste O
for O
those O
simple O
pleasures O
in O
which O
no O
alloy O
can O
possibly O
mix O
, O
then O
that O
study O
is O
certainly O
unlawful O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
not O
befitting O
the O
human O
mind O
. O
If O
this O
rule O
were O
always O
observed O
; O
if O
no O
man O
allowed O
any O
pursuit O
whatsoever O
to O
interfere O
with O
the O
tranquillity O
of O
his O
domestic O
affections O
, O
Greece O
had O
not O
been O
enslaved O
; O
Cæsar O
would O
have O
spared O
his O
country O
; O
America O
would O
have O
been O
discovered O
more O
gradually O
; O
and O
the O
empires O
of O
Mexico O
and O
Peru O
had O
not O
been O
destroyed O
. O
But O
I O
forget O
that O
I O
am O
moralizing O
in O
the O
most O
interesting O
part O
of O
my O
tale O
; O
and O
your O
looks O
remind O
me O
to O
proceed O
. O
My O
father O
made O
no O
reproach O
in O
his O
letters O
; O
and O
only O
took O
notice O
of O
my O
silence O
by O
inquiring O
into O
my O
occupations O
more O
particularly O
than O
before O
. O
Winter O
, O
spring O
, O
and O
summer O
, O
passed O
away O
during O
my O
labours O
; O
but O
I O
did O
not O
watch O
the O
blossom O
or O
the O
expanding O
leaves—sights O
which O
before O
always O
yielded O
me O
supreme O
delight O
, O
so O
deeply O
was O
I O
engrossed O
in O
my O
occupation O
. O
The O
leaves O
of O
that O
year O
had O
withered O
before O
my O
work O
drew O
near O
to O
a O
close O
; O
and O
now O
every O
day O
shewed O
me O
more O
plainly O
how O
well O
I O
had O
succeeded O
. O
But O
my O
enthusiasm O
was O
checked O
by O
my O
anxiety O
, O
and O
I O
appeared O
rather O
like O
one O
doomed O
by O
slavery O
to O
toil O
in O
the O
mines O
, O
or O
any O
other O
unwholesome O
trade O
, O
than O
an O
artist O
occupied O
by O
his O
favourite O
employment O
. O
Every O
night O
I O
was O
oppressed O
by O
a O
slow O
fever O
, O
and O
I O
became O
nervous O
to O
a O
most O
painful O
degree O
; O
a O
disease O
that O
I O
regretted O
the O
more O
because O
I O
had O
hitherto O
enjoyed O
most O
excellent O
health O
, O
and O
had O
always O
boasted O
of O
the O
firmness O
of O
my O
nerves O
. O
But O
I O
believed O
that O
exercise O
and O
amusement O
would O
soon O
drive O
away O
such O
symptoms O
; O
and O
I O
promised O
myself O
both O
of O
these O
, O
when O
my O
creation O
should O
be O
complete O
. O
