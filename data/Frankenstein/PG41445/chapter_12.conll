Nothing O
is O
more O
painful O
to O
the O
human O
mind O
, O
than O
, O
after O
the O
feelings O
have O
been O
worked O
up O
by O
a O
quick O
succession O
of O
events O
, O
the O
dead O
calmness O
of O
inaction O
and O
certainty O
which O
follows O
, O
and O
deprives O
the O
soul O
both O
of O
hope O
and O
fear O
. O
Justine O
died O
; O
she O
rested O
; O
and O
I O
was O
alive O
. O
The O
blood O
flowed O
freely O
in O
my O
veins O
, O
but O
a O
weight O
of O
despair O
and O
remorse O
pressed O
on O
my O
heart O
, O
which O
nothing O
could O
remove O
. O
Sleep O
fled O
from O
my O
eyes O
; O
I O
wandered O
like O
an O
evil O
spirit O
, O
for O
I O
had O
committed O
deeds O
of O
mischief O
beyond O
description O
horrible O
, O
and O
more O
, O
much O
more O
, O
( O
I O
persuaded O
myself O
) O
was O
yet O
behind O
. O
Yet O
my O
heart O
overflowed O
with O
kindness O
, O
and O
the O
love O
of O
virtue O
. O
I O
had O
begun O
life O
with O
benevolent O
intentions O
, O
and O
thirsted O
for O
the O
moment O
when O
I O
should O
put O
them O
in O
practice O
, O
and O
make O
myself O
useful O
to O
my O
fellow-beings O
. O
Now O
all O
was O
blasted O
: O
instead O
of O
that O
serenity O
of O
conscience O
, O
which O
allowed O
me O
to O
look O
back O
upon O
the O
past O
with O
self-satisfaction O
, O
and O
from O
thence O
to O
gather O
promise O
of O
new O
hopes O
, O
I O
was O
seized O
by O
remorse O
and O
the O
sense O
of O
guilt O
, O
which O
hurried O
me O
away O
to O
a O
hell O
of O
intense O
tortures O
, O
such O
as O
no O
language O
can O
describe O
. O
This O
state O
of O
mind O
preyed O
upon O
my O
health O
, O
which O
had O
entirely O
recovered O
from O
the O
first O
shock O
it O
had O
sustained O
. O
I O
shunned O
the O
face O
of O
man O
; O
all O
sound O
of O
joy O
or O
complacency O
was O
torture O
to O
me O
; O
solitude O
was O
my O
only O
consolation—deep O
, O
dark O
, O
death-like O
solitude O
. O
My O
father O
observed O
with O
pain O
the O
alteration O
perceptible O
in O
my O
disposition O
and O
habits O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
reason O
with O
me O
on O
the O
folly O
of O
giving O
way O
to O
immoderate O
grief O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
think O
, O
Victor O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
that O
I O
do O
not O
suffer O
also O
? O
No O
one O
could O
love O
a O
child O
more O
than O
I O
loved O
your O
brother O
; O
" O
( O
tears O
came O
into O
his O
eyes O
as O
he O
spoke O
) O
; O
" O
but O
is O
it O
not O
a O
duty O
to O
the O
survivors O
, O
that O
we O
should O
refrain O
from O
augmenting O
their O
unhappiness O
by O
an O
appearance O
of O
immoderate O
grief O
? O
It O
is O
also O
a O
duty O
owed O
to O
yourself O
; O
for O
excessive O
sorrow O
prevents O
improvement O
or O
enjoyment O
, O
or O
even O
the O
discharge O
of O
daily O
usefulness O
, O
without O
which O
no O
man O
is O
fit O
for O
society O
. O
" O
This O
advice O
, O
although O
good O
, O
was O
totally O
inapplicable O
to O
my O
case O
; O
I O
should O
have O
been O
the O
first O
to O
hide O
my O
grief O
, O
and O
console O
my O
friends O
, O
if O
remorse O
had O
not O
mingled O
its O
bitterness O
with O
my O
other O
sensations O
. O
Now O
I O
could O
only O
answer O
my O
father O
with O
a O
look O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
hide O
myself O
from O
his O
view O
. O
About O
this O
time O
we O
retired O
to O
our O
house O
at O
Belrive O
. O
This O
change O
was O
particularly O
agreeable O
to O
me O
. O
The O
shutting O
of O
the O
gates O
regularly O
at O
ten O
o'clock O
, O
and O
the O
impossibility O
of O
remaining O
on O
the O
lake O
after O
that O
hour O
, O
had O
rendered O
our O
residence O
within O
the O
walls O
of O
Geneva O
very O
irksome O
to O
me O
. O
I O
was O
now O
free O
. O
Often O
, O
after O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
had O
retired O
for O
the O
night O
, O
I O
took O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
passed O
many O
hours O
upon O
the O
water O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
with O
my O
sails O
set O
, O
I O
was O
carried O
by O
the O
wind O
; O
and O
sometimes O
, O
after O
rowing O
into O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
lake O
, O
I O
left O
the O
boat O
to O
pursue O
its O
own O
course O
, O
and O
gave O
way O
to O
my O
own O
miserable O
reflections O
. O
I O
was O
often O
tempted O
, O
when O
all O
was O
at O
peace O
around O
me O
, O
and O
I O
the O
only O
unquiet O
thing O
that O
wandered O
restless O
in O
a O
scene O
so O
beautiful O
and O
heavenly O
, O
if O
I O
except O
some O
bat O
, O
or O
the O
frogs O
, O
whose O
harsh O
and O
interrupted O
croaking O
was O
heard O
only O
when O
I O
approached O
the O
shore—often O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
was O
tempted O
to O
plunge O
into O
the O
silent O
lake O
, O
that O
the O
waters O
might O
close O
over O
me O
and O
my O
calamities O
for O
ever O
. O
But O
I O
was O
restrained O
, O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
heroic O
and O
suffering O
Elizabeth O
, O
whom O
I O
tenderly O
loved O
, O
and O
whose O
existence O
was O
bound O
up O
in O
mine O
. O
I O
thought O
also O
of O
my O
father O
, O
and O
surviving O
brother O
: O
should O
I O
by O
my O
base O
desertion O
leave O
them O
exposed O
and O
unprotected O
to O
the O
malice O
of O
the O
fiend O
whom O
I O
had O
let O
loose O
among O
them O
? O
At O
these O
moments O
I O
wept O
bitterly O
, O
and O
wished O
that O
peace O
would O
revisit O
my O
mind O
only O
that O
I O
might O
afford O
them O
consolation O
and O
happiness O
. O
But O
that O
could O
not O
be O
. O
Remorse O
extinguished O
every O
hope O
. O
I O
had O
been O
the O
author O
of O
unalterable O
evils O
; O
and O
I O
lived O
in O
daily O
fear O
, O
lest O
the O
monster O
whom O
I O
had O
created O
should O
perpetrate O
some O
new O
wickedness O
. O
I O
had O
an O
obscure O
feeling O
that O
all O
was O
not O
over O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
still O
commit O
some O
signal O
crime O
, O
which O
by O
its O
enormity O
should O
almost O
efface O
the O
recollection O
of O
the O
past O
. O
There O
was O
always O
scope O
for O
fear O
, O
so O
long O
as O
any O
thing O
I O
loved O
remained O
behind O
. O
My O
abhorrence O
of O
this O
fiend O
can O
not O
be O
conceived O
. O
When O
I O
thought O
of O
him O
, O
I O
gnashed O
my O
teeth O
, O
my O
eyes O
became O
inflamed O
, O
and O
I O
ardently O
wished O
to O
extinguish O
that O
life O
which O
I O
had O
so O
thoughtlessly O
bestowed O
. O
When O
I O
reflected O
on O
his O
crimes O
and O
malice O
, O
my O
hatred O
and O
revenge O
burst O
all O
bounds O
of O
moderation O
. O
I O
would O
have O
made O
a O
pilgrimage O
to O
the O
highest O
peak O
of O
the O
Andes O
, O
could O
I O
, O
when O
there O
, O
have O
precipitated O
him O
to O
their O
base O
. O
I O
wished O
to O
see O
him O
again O
, O
that O
I O
might O
wreak O
the O
utmost O
extent O
of O
anger O
on O
his O
head O
, O
and O
avenge O
the O
deaths O
of O
William O
and O
Justine O
. O
Our O
house O
was O
the O
house O
of O
mourning O
. O
My O
father O
's O
health O
was O
deeply O
shaken O
by O
the O
horror O
of O
the O
recent O
events O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
sad O
and O
desponding O
; O
she O
no O
longer O
took O
delight O
in O
her O
ordinary O
occupations O
; O
all O
pleasure O
seemed O
to O
her O
sacrilege O
toward O
the O
dead O
; O
eternal O
woe O
and O
tears O
she O
then O
thought O
was O
the O
just O
tribute O
she O
should O
pay O
to O
innocence O
so O
blasted O
and O
destroyed O
. O
She O
was O
no O
longer O
that O
happy O
creature O
, O
who O
in O
earlier O
youth O
wandered O
with O
me O
on O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
talked O
with O
ecstacy O
of O
our O
future O
prospects O
. O
She O
had O
become O
grave O
, O
and O
often O
conversed O
of O
the O
inconstancy O
of O
fortune O
, O
and O
the O
instability O
of O
human O
life O
. O
" O
When O
I O
reflect O
, O
my O
dear O
cousin O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
on O
the O
miserable O
death O
of O
Justine O
Moritz O
, O
I O
no O
longer O
see O
the O
world O
and O
its O
works O
as O
they O
before O
appeared O
to O
me O
. O
Before O
, O
I O
looked O
upon O
the O
accounts O
of O
vice O
and O
injustice O
, O
that O
I O
read O
in O
books O
or O
heard O
from O
others O
, O
as O
tales O
of O
ancient O
days O
, O
or O
imaginary O
evils O
; O
at O
least O
they O
were O
remote O
, O
and O
more O
familiar O
to O
reason O
than O
to O
the O
imagination O
; O
but O
now O
misery O
has O
come O
home O
, O
and O
men O
appear O
to O
me O
as O
monsters O
thirsting O
for O
each O
other O
's O
blood O
. O
Yet O
I O
am O
certainly O
unjust O
. O
Every O
body O
believed O
that O
poor O
girl O
to O
be O
guilty O
; O
and O
if O
she O
could O
have O
committed O
the O
crime O
for O
which O
she O
suffered O
, O
assuredly O
she O
would O
have O
been O
the O
most O
depraved O
of O
human O
creatures O
. O
For O
the O
sake O
of O
a O
few O
jewels O
, O
to O
have O
murdered O
the O
son O
of O
her O
benefactor O
and O
friend O
, O
a O
child O
whom O
she O
had O
nursed O
from O
its O
birth O
, O
and O
appeared O
to O
love O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
her O
own O
! O
I O
could O
not O
consent O
to O
the O
death O
of O
any O
human O
being O
; O
but O
certainly O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
such O
a O
creature O
unfit O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
society O
of O
men O
. O
Yet O
she O
was O
innocent O
. O
I O
know O
, O
I O
feel O
she O
was O
innocent O
; O
you O
are O
of O
the O
same O
opinion O
, O
and O
that O
confirms O
me O
. O
Alas O
! O
Victor O
, O
when O
falsehood O
can O
look O
so O
like O
the O
truth O
, O
who O
can O
assure O
themselves O
of O
certain O
happiness O
? O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
were O
walking O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
a O
precipice O
, O
towards O
which O
thousands O
are O
crowding O
, O
and O
endeavouring O
to O
plunge O
me O
into O
the O
abyss O
. O
William O
and O
Justine O
were O
assassinated O
, O
and O
the O
murderer O
escapes O
; O
he O
walks O
about O
the O
world O
free O
, O
and O
perhaps O
respected O
. O
But O
even O
if O
I O
were O
condemned O
to O
suffer O
on O
the O
scaffold O
for O
the O
same O
crimes O
, O
I O
would O
not O
change O
places O
with O
such O
a O
wretch O
. O
" O
I O
listened O
to O
this O
discourse O
with O
the O
extremest O
agony O
. O
I O
, O
not O
in O
deed O
, O
but O
in O
effect O
, O
was O
the O
true O
murderer O
. O
Elizabeth O
read O
my O
anguish O
in O
my O
countenance O
, O
and O
kindly O
taking O
my O
hand O
said O
, O
" O
My O
dearest O
cousin O
, O
you O
must O
calm O
yourself O
. O
These O
events O
have O
affected O
me O
, O
God O
knows O
how O
deeply O
; O
but O
I O
am O
not O
so O
wretched O
as O
you O
are O
. O
There O
is O
an O
expression O
of O
despair O
, O
and O
sometimes O
of O
revenge O
, O
in O
your O
countenance O
, O
that O
makes O
me O
tremble O
. O
Be O
calm O
, O
my O
dear O
Victor O
; O
I O
would O
sacrifice O
my O
life O
to O
your O
peace O
. O
We O
surely O
shall O
be O
happy O
: O
quiet O
in O
our O
native O
country O
, O
and O
not O
mingling O
in O
the O
world O
, O
what O
can O
disturb O
our O
tranquillity O
? O
" O
She O
shed O
tears O
as O
she O
said O
this O
, O
distrusting O
the O
very O
solace O
that O
she O
gave O
; O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
she O
smiled O
, O
that O
she O
might O
chase O
away O
the O
fiend O
that O
lurked O
in O
my O
heart O
. O
My O
father O
, O
who O
saw O
in O
the O
unhappiness O
that O
was O
painted O
in O
my O
face O
only O
an O
exaggeration O
of O
that O
sorrow O
which O
I O
might O
naturally O
feel O
, O
thought O
that O
an O
amusement O
suited O
to O
my O
taste O
would O
be O
the O
best O
means O
of O
restoring O
to O
me O
my O
wonted O
serenity O
. O
It O
was O
from O
this O
cause O
that O
he O
had O
removed O
to O
the O
country O
; O
and O
, O
induced O
by O
the O
same O
motive O
, O
he O
now O
proposed O
that O
we O
should O
all O
make O
an O
excursion O
to O
the O
valley O
of O
Chamounix O
. O
I O
had O
been O
there O
before O
, O
but O
Elizabeth O
and O
Ernest O
never O
had O
; O
and O
both O
had O
often O
expressed O
an O
earnest O
desire O
to O
see O
the O
scenery O
of O
this O
place O
, O
which O
had O
been O
described O
to O
them O
as O
so O
wonderful O
and O
sublime O
. O
Accordingly O
we O
departed O
from O
Geneva O
on O
this O
tour O
about O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
month O
of O
August O
, O
nearly O
two O
months O
after O
the O
death O
of O
Justine O
. O
The O
weather O
was O
uncommonly O
fine O
; O
and O
if O
mine O
had O
been O
a O
sorrow O
to O
be O
chased O
away O
by O
any O
fleeting O
circumstance O
, O
this O
excursion O
would O
certainly O
have O
had O
the O
effect O
intended O
by O
my O
father O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
I O
was O
somewhat O
interested O
in O
the O
scene O
; O
it O
sometimes O
lulled O
, O
although O
it O
could O
not O
extinguish O
my O
grief O
. O
During O
the O
first O
day O
we O
travelled O
in O
a O
carriage O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
we O
had O
seen O
the O
mountains O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
towards O
which O
we O
gradually O
advanced O
. O
We O
perceived O
that O
the O
valley O
through O
which O
we O
wound O
, O
and O
which O
was O
formed O
by O
the O
river O
Arve O
, O
whose O
course O
we O
followed O
, O
closed O
in O
upon O
us O
by O
degrees O
; O
and O
when O
the O
sun O
had O
set O
, O
we O
beheld O
immense O
mountains O
and O
precipices O
overhanging O
us O
on O
every O
side O
, O
and O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
river O
raging O
among O
rocks O
, O
and O
the O
dashing O
of O
water-falls O
around O
. O
The O
next O
day O
we O
pursued O
our O
journey O
upon O
mules O
; O
and O
as O
we O
ascended O
still O
higher O
, O
the O
valley O
assumed O
a O
more O
magnificent O
and O
astonishing O
character O
. O
Ruined O
castles O
hanging O
on O
the O
precipices O
of O
piny O
mountains O
; O
the O
impetuous O
Arve O
, O
and O
cottages O
every O
here O
and O
there O
peeping O
forth O
from O
among O
the O
trees O
, O
formed O
a O
scene O
of O
singular O
beauty O
. O
But O
it O
was O
augmented O
and O
rendered O
sublime O
by O
the O
mighty O
Alps O
, O
whose O
white O
and O
shining O
pyramids O
and O
domes O
towered O
above O
all O
, O
as O
belonging O
to O
another O
earth O
, O
the O
habitations O
of O
another O
race O
of O
beings O
. O
We O
passed O
the O
bridge O
of O
Pelissier O
, O
where O
the O
ravine O
, O
which O
the O
river O
forms O
, O
opened O
before O
us O
, O
and O
we O
began O
to O
ascend O
the O
mountain O
that O
overhangs O
it O
. O
Soon O
after O
we O
entered O
the O
valley O
of O
Chamounix O
. O
This O
valley O
is O
more O
wonderful O
and O
sublime O
, O
but O
not O
so O
beautiful O
and O
picturesque O
as O
that O
of O
Servox O
, O
through O
which O
we O
had O
just O
passed O
. O
The O
high O
and O
snowy O
mountains O
were O
its O
immediate O
boundaries O
; O
but O
we O
saw O
no O
more O
ruined O
castles O
and O
fertile O
fields O
. O
Immense O
glaciers O
approached O
the O
road O
; O
we O
heard O
the O
rumbling O
thunder O
of O
the O
falling O
avalanche O
, O
and O
marked O
the O
smoke O
of O
its O
passage O
. O
Mont O
Blânc O
, O
the O
supreme O
and O
magnificent O
Mont O
Blânc O
, O
raised O
itself O
from O
the O
surrounding O
_aiguilles_ O
, O
and O
its O
tremendous O
_dome_ O
overlooked O
the O
valley O
. O
During O
this O
journey O
, O
I O
sometimes O
joined O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
exerted O
myself O
to O
point O
out O
to O
her O
the O
various O
beauties O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
I O
often O
suffered O
my O
mule O
to O
lag O
behind O
, O
and O
indulged O
in O
the O
misery O
of O
reflection O
. O
At O
other O
times O
I O
spurred O
on O
the O
animal O
before O
my O
companions O
, O
that O
I O
might O
forget O
them O
, O
the O
world O
, O
and O
, O
more O
than O
all O
, O
myself O
. O
When O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
I O
alighted O
, O
and O
threw O
myself O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
weighed O
down O
by O
horror O
and O
despair O
. O
At O
eight O
in O
the O
evening O
I O
arrived O
at O
Chamounix O
. O
My O
father O
and O
Elizabeth O
were O
very O
much O
fatigued O
; O
Ernest O
, O
who O
accompanied O
us O
, O
was O
delighted O
, O
and O
in O
high O
spirits O
: O
the O
only O
circumstance O
that O
detracted O
from O
his O
pleasure O
was O
the O
south O
wind O
, O
and O
the O
rain O
it O
seemed O
to O
promise O
for O
the O
next O
day O
. O
We O
retired O
early O
to O
our O
apartments O
, O
but O
not O
to O
sleep O
; O
at O
least O
I O
did O
not O
. O
I O
remained O
many O
hours O
at O
the O
window O
, O
watching O
the O
pallid O
lightning O
that O
played O
above O
Mont O
Blânc O
, O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
rushing O
of O
the O
Arve O
, O
which O
ran O
below O
my O
window O
. O
