The O
being O
finished O
speaking O
, O
and O
fixed O
his O
looks O
upon O
me O
in O
expectation O
of O
a O
reply O
. O
But O
I O
was O
bewildered O
, O
perplexed O
, O
and O
unable O
to O
arrange O
my O
ideas O
sufficiently O
to O
understand O
the O
full O
extent O
of O
his O
proposition O
. O
He O
continued— O
" O
You O
must O
create O
a O
female O
for O
me O
, O
with O
whom O
I O
can O
live O
in O
the O
interchange O
of O
those O
sympathies O
necessary O
for O
my O
being O
. O
This O
you O
alone O
can O
do O
; O
and O
I O
demand O
it O
of O
you O
as O
a O
right O
which O
you O
must O
not O
refuse O
. O
" O
The O
latter O
part O
of O
his O
tale O
had O
kindled O
anew O
in O
me O
the O
anger O
that O
had O
died O
away O
while O
he O
narrated O
his O
peaceful O
life O
among O
the O
cottagers O
, O
and O
, O
as O
he O
said O
this O
, O
I O
could O
no O
longer O
suppress O
the O
rage O
that O
burned O
within O
me O
. O
" O
I O
do O
refuse O
it O
, O
" O
I O
replied O
; O
" O
and O
no O
torture O
shall O
ever O
extort O
a O
consent O
from O
me O
. O
You O
may O
render O
me O
the O
most O
miserable O
of O
men O
, O
but O
you O
shall O
never O
make O
me O
base O
in O
my O
own O
eyes O
. O
Shall O
I O
create O
another O
like O
yourself O
, O
whose O
joint O
wickedness O
might O
desolate O
the O
world O
. O
Begone O
! O
I O
have O
answered O
you O
; O
you O
may O
torture O
me O
, O
but O
I O
will O
never O
consent O
. O
" O
" O
You O
are O
in O
the O
wrong O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
fiend O
; O
" O
and O
, O
instead O
of O
threatening O
, O
I O
am O
content O
to O
reason O
with O
you O
. O
I O
am O
malicious O
because O
I O
am O
miserable O
; O
am O
I O
not O
shunned O
and O
hated O
by O
all O
mankind O
? O
You O
, O
my O
creator O
, O
would O
tear O
me O
to O
pieces O
, O
and O
triumph O
; O
remember O
that O
, O
and O
tell O
me O
why O
I O
should O
pity O
man O
more O
than O
he O
pities O
me O
? O
You O
would O
not O
call O
it O
murder O
, O
if O
you O
could O
precipitate O
me O
into O
one O
of O
those O
ice-rifts O
, O
and O
destroy O
my O
frame O
, O
the O
work O
of O
your O
own O
hands O
. O
Shall O
I O
respect O
man O
, O
when O
he O
contemns O
me O
? O
Let O
him O
live O
with O
me O
in O
the O
interchange O
of O
kindness O
, O
and O
, O
instead O
of O
injury O
, O
I O
would O
bestow O
every O
benefit O
upon O
him O
with O
tears O
of O
gratitude O
at O
his O
acceptance O
. O
But O
that O
can O
not O
be O
; O
the O
human O
senses O
are O
insurmountable O
barriers O
to O
our O
union O
. O
Yet O
mine O
shall O
not O
be O
the O
submission O
of O
abject O
slavery O
. O
I O
will O
revenge O
my O
injuries O
: O
if O
I O
can O
not O
inspire O
love O
, O
I O
will O
cause O
fear O
; O
and O
chiefly O
towards O
you O
my O
arch-enemy O
, O
because O
my O
creator O
, O
do O
I O
swear O
inextinguishable O
hatred O
. O
Have O
a O
care O
: O
I O
will O
work O
at O
your O
destruction O
, O
nor O
finish O
until O
I O
desolate O
your O
heart O
, O
so O
that O
you O
curse O
the O
hour O
of O
your O
birth O
. O
" O
A O
fiendish O
rage O
animated O
him O
as O
he O
said O
this O
; O
his O
face O
was O
wrinkled O
into O
contortions O
too O
horrible O
for O
human O
eyes O
to O
behold O
; O
but O
presently O
he O
calmed O
himself O
, O
and O
proceeded— O
" O
I O
intended O
to O
reason O
. O
This O
passion O
is O
detrimental O
to O
me O
; O
for O
you O
do O
not O
reflect O
that O
you O
are O
the O
cause O
of O
its O
excess O
. O
If O
any O
being O
felt O
emotions O
of O
benevolence O
towards O
me O
, O
I O
should O
return O
them O
an O
hundred O
and O
an O
hundred O
fold O
; O
for O
that O
one O
creature O
's O
sake O
, O
I O
would O
make O
peace O
with O
the O
whole O
kind O
! O
But O
I O
now O
indulge O
in O
dreams O
of O
bliss O
that O
can O
not O
be O
realized O
. O
What O
I O
ask O
of O
you O
is O
reasonable O
and O
moderate O
; O
I O
demand O
a O
creature O
of O
another O
sex O
, O
but O
as O
hideous O
as O
myself O
: O
the O
gratification O
is O
small O
, O
but O
it O
is O
all O
that O
I O
can O
receive O
, O
and O
it O
shall O
content O
me O
. O
It O
is O
true O
, O
we O
shall O
be O
monsters O
, O
cut O
off O
from O
all O
the O
world O
; O
but O
on O
that O
account O
we O
shall O
be O
more O
attached O
to O
one O
another O
. O
Our O
lives O
will O
not O
be O
happy O
, O
but O
they O
will O
be O
harmless O
, O
and O
free O
from O
the O
misery O
I O
now O
feel O
. O
Oh O
! O
my O
creator O
, O
make O
me O
happy O
; O
let O
me O
feel O
gratitude O
towards O
you O
for O
one O
benefit O
! O
Let O
me O
see O
that O
I O
excite O
the O
sympathy O
of O
some O
existing O
thing O
; O
do O
not O
deny O
me O
my O
request O
! O
" O
I O
was O
moved O
. O
I O
shuddered O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
possible O
consequences O
of O
my O
consent O
; O
but O
I O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
some O
justice O
in O
his O
argument O
. O
His O
tale O
, O
and O
the O
feelings O
he O
now O
expressed O
, O
proved O
him O
to O
be O
a O
creature O
of O
fine O
sensations O
; O
and O
did O
I O
not O
, O
as O
his O
maker O
, O
owe O
him O
all O
the O
portion O
of O
happiness O
that O
it O
was O
in O
my O
power O
to O
bestow O
? O
He O
saw O
my O
change O
of O
feeling O
, O
and O
continued— O
" O
If O
you O
consent O
, O
neither O
you O
nor O
any O
other O
human O
being O
shall O
ever O
see O
us O
again O
: O
I O
will O
go O
to O
the O
vast O
wilds O
of O
South O
America O
. O
My O
food O
is O
not O
that O
of O
man O
; O
I O
do O
not O
destroy O
the O
lamb O
and O
the O
kid O
, O
to O
glut O
my O
appetite O
; O
acorns O
and O
berries O
afford O
me O
sufficient O
nourishment O
. O
My O
companion O
will O
be O
of O
the O
same O
nature O
as O
myself O
, O
and O
will O
be O
content O
with O
the O
same O
fare O
. O
We O
shall O
make O
our O
bed O
of O
dried O
leaves O
; O
the O
sun O
will O
shine O
on O
us O
as O
on O
man O
, O
and O
will O
ripen O
our O
food O
. O
The O
picture O
I O
present O
to O
you O
is O
peaceful O
and O
human O
, O
and O
you O
must O
feel O
that O
you O
could O
deny O
it O
only O
in O
the O
wantonness O
of O
power O
and O
cruelty O
. O
Pitiless O
as O
you O
have O
been O
towards O
me O
, O
I O
now O
see O
compassion O
in O
your O
eyes O
: O
let O
me O
seize O
the O
favourable O
moment O
, O
and O
persuade O
you O
to O
promise O
what O
I O
so O
ardently O
desire O
. O
" O
" O
You O
propose O
, O
" O
replied O
I O
, O
" O
to O
fly O
from O
the O
habitations O
of O
man O
, O
to O
dwell O
in O
those O
wilds O
where O
the O
beasts O
of O
the O
field O
will O
be O
your O
only O
companions O
. O
How O
can O
you O
, O
who O
long O
for O
the O
love O
and O
sympathy O
of O
man O
, O
persevere O
in O
this O
exile O
? O
You O
will O
return O
, O
and O
again O
seek O
their O
kindness O
, O
and O
you O
will O
meet O
with O
their O
detestation O
; O
your O
evil O
passions O
will O
be O
renewed O
, O
and O
you O
will O
then O
have O
a O
companion O
to O
aid O
you O
in O
the O
task O
of O
destruction O
. O
This O
may O
not O
be O
; O
cease O
to O
argue O
the O
point O
, O
for O
I O
can O
not O
consent O
. O
" O
" O
How O
inconstant O
are O
your O
feelings O
! O
but O
a O
moment O
ago O
you O
were O
moved O
by O
my O
representations O
, O
and O
why O
do O
you O
again O
harden O
yourself O
to O
my O
complaints O
? O
I O
swear O
to O
you O
, O
by O
the O
earth O
which O
I O
inhabit O
, O
and O
by O
you O
that O
made O
me O
, O
that O
, O
with O
the O
companion O
you O
bestow O
, O
I O
will O
quit O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
man O
, O
and O
dwell O
, O
as O
it O
may O
chance O
, O
in O
the O
most O
savage O
of O
places O
. O
My O
evil O
passions O
will O
have O
fled O
, O
for O
I O
shall O
meet O
with O
sympathy O
; O
my O
life O
will O
flow O
quietly O
away O
, O
and O
, O
in O
my O
dying O
moments O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
curse O
my O
maker O
. O
" O
His O
words O
had O
a O
strange O
effect O
upon O
me O
. O
I O
compassionated O
him O
, O
and O
sometimes O
felt O
a O
wish O
to O
console O
him O
; O
but O
when O
I O
looked O
upon O
him O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
filthy O
mass O
that O
moved O
and O
talked O
, O
my O
heart O
sickened O
, O
and O
my O
feelings O
were O
altered O
to O
those O
of O
horror O
and O
hatred O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
stifle O
these O
sensations O
; O
I O
thought O
, O
that O
as O
I O
could O
not O
sympathize O
with O
him O
, O
I O
had O
no O
right O
to O
withhold O
from O
him O
the O
small O
portion O
of O
happiness O
which O
was O
yet O
in O
my O
power O
to O
bestow O
. O
" O
You O
swear O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
to O
be O
harmless O
; O
but O
have O
you O
not O
already O
shewn O
a O
degree O
of O
malice O
that O
should O
reasonably O
make O
me O
distrust O
you O
? O
May O
not O
even O
this O
be O
a O
feint O
that O
will O
increase O
your O
triumph O
by O
affording O
a O
wider O
scope O
for O
your O
revenge O
? O
" O
" O
How O
is O
this O
? O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
moved O
your O
compassion O
, O
and O
yet O
you O
still O
refuse O
to O
bestow O
on O
me O
the O
only O
benefit O
that O
can O
soften O
my O
heart O
, O
and O
render O
me O
harmless O
. O
If O
I O
have O
no O
ties O
and O
no O
affections O
, O
hatred O
and O
vice O
must O
be O
my O
portion O
; O
the O
love O
of O
another O
will O
destroy O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
crimes O
, O
and O
I O
shall O
become O
a O
thing O
, O
of O
whose O
existence O
every O
one O
will O
be O
ignorant O
. O
My O
vices O
are O
the O
children O
of O
a O
forced O
solitude O
that O
I O
abhor O
; O
and O
my O
virtues O
will O
necessarily O
arise O
when O
I O
live O
in O
communion O
with O
an O
equal O
. O
I O
shall O
feel O
the O
affections O
of O
a O
sensitive O
being O
, O
and O
become O
linked O
to O
the O
chain O
of O
existence O
and O
events O
, O
from O
which O
I O
am O
now O
excluded O
. O
" O
I O
paused O
some O
time O
to O
reflect O
on O
all O
he O
had O
related O
, O
and O
the O
various O
arguments O
which O
he O
had O
employed O
. O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
promise O
of O
virtues O
which O
he O
had O
displayed O
on O
the O
opening O
of O
his O
existence O
, O
and O
the O
subsequent O
blight O
of O
all O
kindly O
feeling O
by O
the O
loathing O
and O
scorn O
which O
his O
protectors O
had O
manifested O
towards O
him O
. O
His O
power O
and O
threats O
were O
not O
omitted O
in O
my O
calculations O
: O
a O
creature O
who O
could O
exist O
in O
the O
ice O
caves O
of O
the O
glaciers O
, O
and O
hide O
himself O
from O
pursuit O
among O
the O
ridges O
of O
inaccessible O
precipices O
, O
was O
a O
being O
possessing O
faculties O
it O
would O
be O
vain O
to O
cope O
with O
. O
After O
a O
long O
pause O
of O
reflection O
, O
I O
concluded O
, O
that O
the O
justice O
due O
both O
to O
him O
and O
my O
fellow-creatures O
demanded O
of O
me O
that O
I O
should O
comply O
with O
his O
request O
. O
Turning O
to O
him O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
said— O
" O
I O
consent O
to O
your O
demand O
, O
on O
your O
solemn O
oath O
to O
quit O
Europe O
for O
ever O
, O
and O
every O
other O
place O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
man O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
shall O
deliver O
into O
your O
hands O
a O
female O
who O
will O
accompany O
you O
in O
your O
exile O
. O
" O
" O
I O
swear O
, O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
" O
by O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
by O
the O
blue O
sky O
of O
heaven O
, O
that O
if O
you O
grant O
my O
prayer O
, O
while O
they O
exist O
you O
shall O
never O
behold O
me O
again O
. O
Depart O
to O
your O
home O
, O
and O
commence O
your O
labours O
: O
I O
shall O
watch O
their O
progress O
with O
unutterable O
anxiety O
; O
and O
fear O
not O
but O
that O
when O
you O
are O
ready O
I O
shall O
appear O
. O
" O
Saying O
this O
, O
he O
suddenly O
quitted O
me O
, O
fearful O
, O
perhaps O
, O
of O
any O
change O
in O
my O
sentiments O
. O
I O
saw O
him O
descend O
the O
mountain O
with O
greater O
speed O
than O
the O
flight O
of O
an O
eagle O
, O
and O
quickly O
lost O
him O
among O
the O
undulations O
of O
the O
sea O
of O
ice O
. O
His O
tale O
had O
occupied O
the O
whole O
day O
; O
and O
the O
sun O
was O
upon O
the O
verge O
of O
the O
horizon O
when O
he O
departed O
. O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
ought O
to O
hasten O
my O
descent O
towards O
the O
valley O
, O
as O
I O
should O
soon O
be O
encompassed O
in O
darkness O
; O
but O
my O
heart O
was O
heavy O
, O
and O
my O
steps O
slow O
. O
The O
labour O
of O
winding O
among O
the O
little O
paths O
of O
the O
mountains O
, O
and O
fixing O
my O
feet O
firmly O
as O
I O
advanced O
, O
perplexed O
me O
, O
occupied O
as O
I O
was O
by O
the O
emotions O
which O
the O
occurrences O
of O
the O
day O
had O
produced O
. O
Night O
was O
far O
advanced O
, O
when O
I O
came O
to O
the O
half-way O
resting-place O
, O
and O
seated O
myself O
beside O
the O
fountain O
. O
The O
stars O
shone O
at O
intervals O
, O
as O
the O
clouds O
passed O
from O
over O
them O
; O
the O
dark O
pines O
rose O
before O
me O
, O
and O
every O
here O
and O
there O
a O
broken O
tree O
lay O
on O
the O
ground O
: O
it O
was O
a O
scene O
of O
wonderful O
solemnity O
, O
and O
stirred O
strange O
thoughts O
within O
me O
. O
I O
wept O
bitterly O
; O
and O
, O
clasping O
my O
hands O
in O
agony O
, O
I O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Oh O
! O
stars O
, O
and O
clouds O
, O
and O
winds O
, O
ye O
are O
all O
about O
to O
mock O
me O
: O
if O
ye O
really O
pity O
me O
, O
crush O
sensation O
and O
memory O
; O
let O
me O
become O
as O
nought O
; O
but O
if O
not O
, O
depart O
, O
depart O
and O
leave O
me O
in O
darkness O
. O
" O
These O
were O
wild O
and O
miserable O
thoughts O
; O
but O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
to O
you O
how O
the O
eternal O
twinkling O
of O
the O
stars O
weighed O
upon O
me O
, O
and O
how O
I O
listened O
to O
every O
blast O
of O
wind O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
dull O
ugly O
siroc O
on O
its O
way O
to O
consume O
me O
. O
Morning O
dawned O
before O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
village O
of O
Chamounix O
; O
but O
my O
presence O
, O
so O
haggard O
and O
strange O
, O
hardly O
calmed O
the O
fears O
of O
my O
family O
, O
who O
had O
waited O
the O
whole O
night O
in O
anxious O
expectation O
of O
my O
return O
. O
The O
following O
day O
we O
returned O
to O
Geneva O
. O
The O
intention O
of O
my O
father O
in O
coming O
had O
been O
to O
divert O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
to O
restore O
me O
to O
my O
lost O
tranquillity O
; O
but O
the O
medicine O
had O
been O
fatal O
. O
And O
, O
unable O
to O
account O
for O
the O
excess O
of O
misery O
I O
appeared O
to O
suffer O
, O
he O
hastened O
to O
return O
home O
, O
hoping O
the O
quiet O
and O
monotony O
of O
a O
domestic O
life O
would O
by O
degrees O
alleviate O
my O
sufferings O
from O
whatsoever O
cause O
they O
might O
spring O
. O
For O
myself O
, O
I O
was O
passive O
in O
all O
their O
arrangements O
; O
and O
the O
gentle O
affection O
of O
my O
beloved O
Elizabeth O
was O
inadequate O
to O
draw O
me O
from O
the O
depth O
of O
my O
despair O
. O
The O
promise O
I O
had O
made O
to O
the O
dæmon O
weighed O
upon O
my O
mind O
, O
like O
Dante O
's O
iron O
cowl O
on O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
hellish O
hypocrites O
. O
All O
pleasures O
of O
earth O
and O
sky O
passed O
before O
me O
like O
a O
dream O
, O
and O
that O
thought O
only O
had O
to O
me O
the O
reality O
of O
life O
. O
Can O
you O
wonder O
, O
that O
sometimes O
a O
kind O
of O
insanity O
possessed O
me O
, O
or O
that O
I O
saw O
continually O
about O
me O
a O
multitude O
of O
filthy O
animals O
inflicting O
on O
me O
incessant O
torture O
, O
that O
often O
extorted O
screams O
and O
bitter O
groans O
? O
By O
degrees O
, O
however O
, O
these O
feelings O
became O
calmed O
. O
I O
entered O
again O
into O
the O
every-day O
scene O
of O
life O
, O
if O
not O
with O
interest O
, O
at O
least O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
tranquillity O
. O
