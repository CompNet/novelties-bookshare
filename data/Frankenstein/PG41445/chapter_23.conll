I O
sat O
one O
evening O
in O
my O
laboratory O
; O
the O
sun O
had O
set O
, O
and O
the O
moon O
was O
just O
rising O
from O
the O
sea O
; O
I O
had O
not O
sufficient O
light O
for O
my O
employment O
, O
and O
I O
remained O
idle O
, O
in O
a O
pause O
of O
consideration O
of O
whether O
I O
should O
leave O
my O
labour O
for O
the O
night O
, O
or O
hasten O
its O
conclusion O
by O
an O
unremitting O
attention O
to O
it O
. O
As O
I O
sat O
, O
a O
train O
of O
reflection O
occurred O
to O
me O
, O
which O
led O
me O
to O
consider O
the O
effects O
of O
what O
I O
was O
now O
doing O
. O
Three O
years O
before O
I O
was O
engaged O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
, O
and O
had O
created O
a O
fiend O
whose O
unparalleled O
barbarity O
had O
desolated O
my O
heart O
, O
and O
filled O
it O
for O
ever O
with O
the O
bitterest O
remorse O
. O
I O
was O
now O
about O
to O
form O
another O
being O
, O
of O
whose O
dispositions O
I O
was O
alike O
ignorant O
; O
she O
might O
become O
ten O
thousand O
times O
more O
malignant O
than O
her O
mate O
, O
and O
delight O
, O
for O
its O
own O
sake O
, O
in O
murder O
and O
wretchedness O
. O
He O
had O
sworn O
to O
quit O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
man O
, O
and O
hide O
himself O
in O
deserts O
; O
but O
she O
had O
not O
; O
and O
she O
, O
who O
in O
all O
probability O
was O
to O
become O
a O
thinking O
and O
reasoning O
animal O
, O
might O
refuse O
to O
comply O
with O
a O
compact O
made O
before O
her O
creation O
. O
They O
might O
even O
hate O
each O
other O
; O
the O
creature O
who O
already O
lived O
loathed O
his O
own O
deformity O
, O
and O
might O
he O
not O
conceive O
a O
greater O
abhorrence O
for O
it O
when O
it O
came O
before O
his O
eyes O
in O
the O
female O
form O
? O
She O
also O
might O
turn O
with O
disgust O
from O
him O
to O
the O
superior O
beauty O
of O
man O
; O
she O
might O
quit O
him O
, O
and O
he O
be O
again O
alone O
, O
exasperated O
by O
the O
fresh O
provocation O
of O
being O
deserted O
by O
one O
of O
his O
own O
species O
. O
Even O
if O
they O
were O
to O
leave O
Europe O
, O
and O
inhabit O
the O
deserts O
of O
the O
new O
world O
, O
yet O
one O
of O
the O
first O
results O
of O
those O
sympathies O
for O
which O
the O
dæmon O
thirsted O
would O
be O
children O
, O
and O
a O
race O
of O
devils O
would O
be O
propagated O
upon O
the O
earth O
, O
who O
might O
make O
the O
very O
existence O
of O
the O
species O
of O
man O
a O
condition O
precarious O
and O
full O
of O
terror O
. O
Had O
I O
a O
right O
, O
for O
my O
own O
benefit O
, O
to O
inflict O
this O
curse O
upon O
everlasting O
generations O
? O
I O
had O
before O
been O
moved O
by O
the O
sophisms O
of O
the O
being O
I O
had O
created O
; O
I O
had O
been O
struck O
senseless O
by O
his O
fiendish O
threats O
: O
but O
now O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
the O
wickedness O
of O
my O
promise O
burst O
upon O
me O
; O
I O
shuddered O
to O
think O
that O
future O
ages O
might O
curse O
me O
as O
their O
pest O
, O
whose O
selfishness O
had O
not O
hesitated O
to O
buy O
its O
own O
peace O
at O
the O
price O
perhaps O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
whole O
human O
race O
. O
I O
trembled O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
failed O
within O
me O
; O
when O
, O
on O
looking O
up O
, O
I O
saw O
, O
by O
the O
light O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
the O
dæmon O
at O
the O
casement O
. O
A O
ghastly O
grin O
wrinkled O
his O
lips O
as O
he O
gazed O
on O
me O
, O
where O
I O
sat O
fulfilling O
the O
task O
which O
he O
had O
allotted O
to O
me O
. O
Yes O
, O
he O
had O
followed O
me O
in O
my O
travels O
; O
he O
had O
loitered O
in O
forests O
, O
hid O
himself O
in O
caves O
, O
or O
taken O
refuge O
in O
wide O
and O
desert O
heaths O
; O
and O
he O
now O
came O
to O
mark O
my O
progress O
, O
and O
claim O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
my O
promise O
. O
As O
I O
looked O
on O
him O
, O
his O
countenance O
expressed O
the O
utmost O
extent O
of O
malice O
and O
treachery O
. O
I O
thought O
with O
a O
sensation O
of O
madness O
on O
my O
promise O
of O
creating O
another O
like O
to O
him O
, O
and O
, O
trembling O
with O
passion O
, O
tore O
to O
pieces O
the O
thing O
on O
which O
I O
was O
engaged O
. O
The O
wretch O
saw O
me O
destroy O
the O
creature O
on O
whose O
future O
existence O
he O
depended O
for O
happiness O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
howl O
of O
devilish O
despair O
and O
revenge O
, O
withdrew O
. O
I O
left O
the O
room O
, O
and O
, O
locking O
the O
door O
, O
made O
a O
solemn O
vow O
in O
my O
own O
heart O
never O
to O
resume O
my O
labours O
; O
and O
then O
, O
with O
trembling O
steps O
, O
I O
sought O
my O
own O
apartment O
. O
I O
was O
alone O
; O
none O
were O
near O
me O
to O
dissipate O
the O
gloom O
, O
and O
relieve O
me O
from O
the O
sickening O
oppression O
of O
the O
most O
terrible O
reveries O
. O
Several O
hours O
past O
, O
and O
I O
remained O
near O
my O
window O
gazing O
on O
the O
sea O
; O
it O
was O
almost O
motionless O
, O
for O
the O
winds O
were O
hushed O
, O
and O
all O
nature O
reposed O
under O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
quiet O
moon O
. O
A O
few O
fishing O
vessels O
alone O
specked O
the O
water O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
the O
gentle O
breeze O
wafted O
the O
sound O
of O
voices O
, O
as O
the O
fishermen O
called O
to O
one O
another O
. O
I O
felt O
the O
silence O
, O
although O
I O
was O
hardly O
conscious O
of O
its O
extreme O
profundity O
until O
my O
ear O
was O
suddenly O
arrested O
by O
the O
paddling O
of O
oars O
near O
the O
shore O
, O
and O
a O
person O
landed O
close O
to O
my O
house O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
after O
, O
I O
heard O
the O
creaking O
of O
my O
door O
, O
as O
if O
some O
one O
endeavoured O
to O
open O
it O
softly O
. O
I O
trembled O
from O
head O
to O
foot O
; O
I O
felt O
a O
presentiment O
of O
who O
it O
was O
, O
and O
wished O
to O
rouse O
one O
of O
the O
peasants O
who O
dwelt O
in O
a O
cottage O
not O
far O
from O
mine O
; O
but O
I O
was O
overcome O
by O
the O
sensation O
of O
helplessness O
, O
so O
often O
felt O
in O
frightful O
dreams O
, O
when O
you O
in O
vain O
endeavour O
to O
fly O
from O
an O
impending O
danger O
, O
and O
was O
rooted O
to O
the O
spot O
. O
Presently O
I O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
footsteps O
along O
the O
passage O
; O
the O
door O
opened O
, O
and O
the O
wretch O
whom O
I O
dreaded O
appeared O
. O
Shutting O
the O
door O
, O
he O
approached O
me O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
a O
smothered O
voice— O
" O
You O
have O
destroyed O
the O
work O
which O
you O
began O
; O
what O
is O
it O
that O
you O
intend O
? O
Do O
you O
dare O
to O
break O
your O
promise O
? O
I O
have O
endured O
toil O
and O
misery O
: O
I O
left O
Switzerland O
with O
you O
; O
I O
crept O
along O
the O
shores O
of O
the O
Rhine O
, O
among O
its O
willow O
islands O
, O
and O
over O
the O
summits O
of O
its O
hills O
. O
I O
have O
dwelt O
many O
months O
in O
the O
heaths O
of O
England O
, O
and O
among O
the O
deserts O
of O
Scotland O
. O
I O
have O
endured O
incalculable O
fatigue O
, O
and O
cold O
, O
and O
hunger O
; O
do O
you O
dare O
destroy O
my O
hopes O
? O
" O
" O
Begone O
! O
I O
do O
break O
my O
promise O
; O
never O
will O
I O
create O
another O
like O
yourself O
, O
equal O
in O
deformity O
and O
wickedness O
. O
" O
" O
Slave O
, O
I O
before O
reasoned O
with O
you O
, O
but O
you O
have O
proved O
yourself O
unworthy O
of O
my O
condescension O
. O
Remember O
that O
I O
have O
power O
; O
you O
believe O
yourself O
miserable O
, O
but O
I O
can O
make O
you O
so O
wretched O
that O
the O
light O
of O
day O
will O
be O
hateful O
to O
you O
. O
You O
are O
my O
creator O
, O
but O
I O
am O
your O
master O
; O
—obey O
! O
" O
" O
The O
hour O
of O
my O
weakness O
is O
past O
, O
and O
the O
period O
of O
your O
power O
is O
arrived O
. O
Your O
threats O
can O
not O
move O
me O
to O
do O
an O
act O
of O
wickedness O
; O
but O
they O
confirm O
me O
in O
a O
resolution O
of O
not O
creating O
you O
a O
companion O
in O
vice O
. O
Shall O
I O
, O
in O
cool O
blood O
, O
set O
loose O
upon O
the O
earth O
a O
dæmon O
, O
whose O
delight O
is O
in O
death O
and O
wretchedness O
. O
Begone O
! O
I O
am O
firm O
, O
and O
your O
words O
will O
only O
exasperate O
my O
rage O
. O
" O
The O
monster O
saw O
my O
determination O
in O
my O
face O
, O
and O
gnashed O
his O
teeth O
in O
the O
impotence O
of O
anger O
. O
" O
Shall O
each O
man O
, O
" O
cried O
he O
, O
" O
find O
a O
wife O
for O
his O
bosom O
, O
and O
each O
beast O
have O
his O
mate O
, O
and O
I O
be O
alone O
? O
I O
had O
feelings O
of O
affection O
, O
and O
they O
were O
requited O
by O
detestation O
and O
scorn O
. O
Man O
, O
you O
may O
hate O
; O
but O
beware O
! O
Your O
hours O
will O
pass O
in O
dread O
and O
misery O
, O
and O
soon O
the O
bolt O
will O
fall O
which O
must O
ravish O
from O
you O
your O
happiness O
for O
ever O
. O
Are O
you O
to O
be O
happy O
, O
while O
I O
grovel O
in O
the O
intensity O
of O
my O
wretchedness O
? O
You O
can O
blast O
my O
other O
passions O
; O
but O
revenge O
remains—revenge O
, O
henceforth O
dearer O
than O
light O
or O
food O
! O
I O
may O
die O
; O
but O
first O
you O
, O
my O
tyrant O
and O
tormentor O
, O
shall O
curse O
the O
sun O
that O
gazes O
on O
your O
misery O
. O
Beware O
; O
for O
I O
am O
fearless O
, O
and O
therefore O
powerful O
. O
I O
will O
watch O
with O
the O
wiliness O
of O
a O
snake O
, O
that O
I O
may O
sting O
with O
its O
venom O
. O
Man O
, O
you O
shall O
repent O
of O
the O
injuries O
you O
inflict O
. O
" O
" O
Devil O
, O
cease O
; O
and O
do O
not O
poison O
the O
air O
with O
these O
sounds O
of O
malice O
. O
I O
have O
declared O
my O
resolution O
to O
you O
, O
and O
I O
am O
no O
coward O
to O
bend O
beneath O
words O
. O
Leave O
me O
; O
I O
am O
inexorable O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
well O
. O
I O
go O
; O
but O
remember O
, O
I O
shall O
be O
with O
you O
on O
your O
wedding-night O
. O
" O
I O
started O
forward O
, O
and O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Villain O
! O
before O
you O
sign O
my O
death-warrant O
, O
be O
sure O
that O
you O
are O
yourself O
safe O
. O
" O
I O
would O
have O
seized O
him O
; O
but O
he O
eluded O
me O
, O
and O
quitted O
the O
house O
with O
precipitation O
: O
in O
a O
few O
moments O
I O
saw O
him O
in O
his O
boat O
, O
which O
shot O
across O
the O
waters O
with O
an O
arrowy O
swiftness O
, O
and O
was O
soon O
lost O
amidst O
the O
waves O
. O
All O
was O
again O
silent O
; O
but O
his O
words O
rung O
in O
my O
ears O
. O
I O
burned O
with O
rage O
to O
pursue O
the O
murderer O
of O
my O
peace O
, O
and O
precipitate O
him O
into O
the O
ocean O
. O
I O
walked O
up O
and O
down O
my O
room O
hastily O
and O
perturbed O
, O
while O
my O
imagination O
conjured O
up O
a O
thousand O
images O
to O
torment O
and O
sting O
me O
. O
Why O
had O
I O
not O
followed O
him O
, O
and O
closed O
with O
him O
in O
mortal O
strife O
? O
But O
I O
had O
suffered O
him O
to O
depart O
, O
and O
he O
had O
directed O
his O
course O
towards O
the O
main O
land O
. O
I O
shuddered O
to O
think O
who O
might O
be O
the O
next O
victim O
sacrificed O
to O
his O
insatiate O
revenge O
. O
And O
then O
I O
thought O
again O
of O
his O
words— O
" O
_I O
will O
be O
with O
you O
on O
your O
wedding-night._ O
" O
That O
then O
was O
the O
period O
fixed O
for O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
my O
destiny O
. O
In O
that O
hour O
I O
should O
die O
, O
and O
at O
once O
satisfy O
and O
extinguish O
his O
malice O
. O
The O
prospect O
did O
not O
move O
me O
to O
fear O
; O
yet O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
my O
beloved O
Elizabeth O
, O
—of O
her O
tears O
and O
endless O
sorrow O
, O
when O
she O
should O
find O
her O
lover O
so O
barbarously O
snatched O
from O
her O
, O
—tears O
, O
the O
first O
I O
had O
shed O
for O
many O
months O
, O
streamed O
from O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
I O
resolved O
not O
to O
fall O
before O
my O
enemy O
without O
a O
bitter O
struggle O
. O
The O
night O
passed O
away O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
rose O
from O
the O
ocean O
; O
my O
feelings O
became O
calmer O
, O
if O
it O
may O
be O
called O
calmness O
, O
when O
the O
violence O
of O
rage O
sinks O
into O
the O
depths O
of O
despair O
. O
I O
left O
the O
house O
, O
the O
horrid O
scene O
of O
the O
last O
night O
's O
contention O
, O
and O
walked O
on O
the O
beach O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
which O
I O
almost O
regarded O
as O
an O
insuperable O
barrier O
between O
me O
and O
my O
fellow-creatures O
; O
nay O
, O
a O
wish O
that O
such O
should O
prove O
the O
fact O
stole O
across O
me O
. O
I O
desired O
that O
I O
might O
pass O
my O
life O
on O
that O
barren O
rock O
, O
wearily O
it O
is O
true O
, O
but O
uninterrupted O
by O
any O
sudden O
shock O
of O
misery O
. O
If O
I O
returned O
, O
it O
was O
to O
be O
sacrificed O
, O
or O
to O
see O
those O
whom O
I O
most O
loved O
die O
under O
the O
grasp O
of O
a O
dæmon O
whom O
I O
had O
myself O
created O
. O
I O
walked O
about O
the O
isle O
like O
a O
restless O
spectre O
, O
separated O
from O
all O
it O
loved O
, O
and O
miserable O
in O
the O
separation O
. O
When O
it O
became O
noon O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
rose O
higher O
, O
I O
lay O
down O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
and O
was O
overpowered O
by O
a O
deep O
sleep O
. O
I O
had O
been O
awake O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
preceding O
night O
, O
my O
nerves O
were O
agitated O
, O
and O
my O
eyes O
inflamed O
by O
watching O
and O
misery O
. O
The O
sleep O
into O
which O
I O
now O
sunk O
refreshed O
me O
; O
and O
when O
I O
awoke O
, O
I O
again O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
belonged O
to O
a O
race O
of O
human O
beings O
like O
myself O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
reflect O
upon O
what O
had O
passed O
with O
greater O
composure O
; O
yet O
still O
the O
words O
of O
the O
fiend O
rung O
in O
my O
ears O
like O
a O
death-knell O
, O
they O
appeared O
like O
a O
dream O
, O
yet O
distinct O
and O
oppressive O
as O
a O
reality O
. O
The O
sun O
had O
far O
descended O
, O
and O
I O
still O
sat O
on O
the O
shore O
, O
satisfying O
my O
appetite O
, O
which O
had O
become O
ravenous O
, O
with O
an O
oaten O
cake O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
a O
fishing-boat O
land O
close O
to O
me O
, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
men O
brought O
me O
a O
packet O
; O
it O
contained O
letters O
from O
Geneva O
, O
and O
one O
from O
Clerval O
, O
entreating O
me O
to O
join O
him O
. O
He O
said O
that O
nearly O
a O
year O
had O
elapsed O
since O
we O
had O
quitted O
Switzerland O
, O
and O
France O
was O
yet O
unvisited O
. O
He O
entreated O
me O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
leave O
my O
solitary O
isle O
, O
and O
meet O
him O
at O
Perth O
, O
in O
a O
week O
from O
that O
time O
, O
when O
we O
might O
arrange O
the O
plan O
of O
our O
future O
proceedings O
. O
This O
letter O
in O
a O
degree O
recalled O
me O
to O
life O
, O
and O
I O
determined O
to O
quit O
my O
island O
at O
the O
expiration O
of O
two O
days O
. O
Yet O
, O
before O
I O
departed O
, O
there O
was O
a O
task O
to O
perform O
, O
on O
which O
I O
shuddered O
to O
reflect O
: O
I O
must O
pack O
my O
chemical O
instruments O
; O
and O
for O
that O
purpose O
I O
must O
enter O
the O
room O
which O
had O
been O
the O
scene O
of O
my O
odious O
work O
, O
and O
I O
must O
handle O
those O
utensils O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
which O
was O
sickening O
to O
me O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
, O
at O
day-break O
, O
I O
summoned O
sufficient O
courage O
, O
and O
unlocked O
the O
door O
of O
my O
laboratory O
. O
The O
remains O
of O
the O
half-finished O
creature O
, O
whom O
I O
had O
destroyed O
, O
lay O
scattered O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
I O
almost O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
had O
mangled O
the O
living O
flesh O
of O
a O
human O
being O
. O
I O
paused O
to O
collect O
myself O
, O
and O
then O
entered O
the O
chamber O
. O
With O
trembling O
hand O
I O
conveyed O
the O
instruments O
out O
of O
the O
room O
; O
but O
I O
reflected O
that O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
leave O
the O
relics O
of O
my O
work O
to O
excite O
the O
horror O
and O
suspicion O
of O
the O
peasants O
, O
and O
I O
accordingly O
put O
them O
into O
a O
basket O
, O
with O
a O
great O
quantity O
of O
stones O
, O
and O
laying O
them O
up O
, O
determined O
to O
throw O
them O
into O
the O
sea O
that O
very O
night O
; O
and O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
I O
sat O
upon O
the O
beach O
, O
employed O
in O
cleaning O
and O
arranging O
my O
chemical O
apparatus O
. O
Nothing O
could O
be O
more O
complete O
than O
the O
alteration O
that O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
my O
feelings O
since O
the O
night O
of O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
dæmon O
. O
I O
had O
before O
regarded O
my O
promise O
with O
a O
gloomy O
despair O
, O
as O
a O
thing O
that O
, O
with O
whatever O
consequences O
, O
must O
be O
fulfilled O
; O
but O
I O
now O
felt O
as O
if O
a O
film O
had O
been O
taken O
from O
before O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
that O
I O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
saw O
clearly O
. O
The O
idea O
of O
renewing O
my O
labours O
did O
not O
for O
one O
instant O
occur O
to O
me O
; O
the O
threat O
I O
had O
heard O
weighed O
on O
my O
thoughts O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
reflect O
that O
a O
voluntary O
act O
of O
mine O
could O
avert O
it O
. O
I O
had O
resolved O
in O
my O
own O
mind O
, O
that O
to O
create O
another O
like O
the O
fiend O
I O
had O
first O
made O
would O
be O
an O
act O
of O
the O
basest O
and O
most O
atrocious O
selfishness O
; O
and O
I O
banished O
from O
my O
mind O
every O
thought O
that O
could O
lead O
to O
a O
different O
conclusion O
. O
Between O
two O
and O
three O
in O
the O
morning O
the O
moon O
rose O
; O
and O
I O
then O
, O
putting O
my O
basket O
aboard O
a O
little O
skiff O
, O
sailed O
out O
about O
four O
miles O
from O
the O
shore O
. O
The O
scene O
was O
perfectly O
solitary O
: O
a O
few O
boats O
were O
returning O
towards O
land O
, O
but O
I O
sailed O
away O
from O
them O
. O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
was O
about O
the O
commission O
of O
a O
dreadful O
crime O
, O
and O
avoided O
with O
shuddering O
anxiety O
any O
encounter O
with O
my O
fellow-creatures O
. O
At O
one O
time O
the O
moon O
, O
which O
had O
before O
been O
clear O
, O
was O
suddenly O
overspread O
by O
a O
thick O
cloud O
, O
and O
I O
took O
advantage O
of O
the O
moment O
of O
darkness O
, O
and O
cast O
my O
basket O
into O
the O
sea O
; O
I O
listened O
to O
the O
gurgling O
sound O
as O
it O
sunk O
, O
and O
then O
sailed O
away O
from O
the O
spot O
. O
The O
sky O
became O
clouded O
; O
but O
the O
air O
was O
pure O
, O
although O
chilled O
by O
the O
north-east O
breeze O
that O
was O
then O
rising O
. O
But O
it O
refreshed O
me O
, O
and O
filled O
me O
with O
such O
agreeable O
sensations O
, O
that O
I O
resolved O
to O
prolong O
my O
stay O
on O
the O
water O
, O
and O
fixing O
the O
rudder O
in O
a O
direct O
position O
, O
stretched O
myself O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
. O
Clouds O
hid O
the O
moon O
, O
every O
thing O
was O
obscure O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
only O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
as O
its O
keel O
cut O
through O
the O
waves O
; O
the O
murmur O
lulled O
me O
, O
and O
in O
a O
short O
time O
I O
slept O
soundly O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
long O
I O
remained O
in O
this O
situation O
, O
but O
when O
I O
awoke O
I O
found O
that O
the O
sun O
had O
already O
mounted O
considerably O
. O
The O
wind O
was O
high O
, O
and O
the O
waves O
continually O
threatened O
the O
safety O
of O
my O
little O
skiff O
. O
I O
found O
that O
the O
wind O
was O
north-east O
, O
and O
must O
have O
driven O
me O
far O
from O
the O
coast O
from O
which O
I O
had O
embarked O
. O
I O
endeavoured O
to O
change O
my O
course O
, O
but O
quickly O
found O
that O
if O
I O
again O
made O
the O
attempt O
the O
boat O
would O
be O
instantly O
filled O
with O
water O
. O
Thus O
situated O
, O
my O
only O
resource O
was O
to O
drive O
before O
the O
wind O
. O
I O
confess O
that O
I O
felt O
a O
few O
sensations O
of O
terror O
. O
I O
had O
no O
compass O
with O
me O
, O
and O
was O
so O
little O
acquainted O
with O
the O
geography O
of O
this O
part O
of O
the O
world O
that O
the O
sun O
was O
of O
little O
benefit O
to O
me O
. O
I O
might O
be O
driven O
into O
the O
wide O
Atlantic O
, O
and O
feel O
all O
the O
tortures O
of O
starvation O
, O
or O
be O
swallowed O
up O
in O
the O
immeasurable O
waters O
that O
roared O
and O
buffeted O
around O
me O
. O
I O
had O
already O
been O
out O
many O
hours O
, O
and O
felt O
the O
torment O
of O
a O
burning O
thirst O
, O
a O
prelude O
to O
my O
other O
sufferings O
. O
I O
looked O
on O
the O
heavens O
, O
which O
were O
covered O
by O
clouds O
that O
flew O
before O
the O
wind O
only O
to O
be O
replaced O
by O
others O
: O
I O
looked O
upon O
the O
sea O
, O
it O
was O
to O
be O
my O
grave O
. O
" O
Fiend O
, O
" O
I O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
your O
task O
is O
already O
fulfilled O
! O
" O
I O
thought O
of O
Elizabeth O
, O
of O
my O
father O
, O
and O
of O
Clerval O
; O
and O
sunk O
into O
a O
reverie O
, O
so O
despairing O
and O
frightful O
, O
that O
even O
now O
, O
when O
the O
scene O
is O
on O
the O
point O
of O
closing O
before O
me O
for O
ever O
, O
I O
shudder O
to O
reflect O
on O
it O
. O
Some O
hours O
passed O
thus O
; O
but O
by O
degrees O
, O
as O
the O
sun O
declined O
towards O
the O
horizon O
, O
the O
wind O
died O
away O
into O
a O
gentle O
breeze O
, O
and O
the O
sea O
became O
free O
from O
breakers O
. O
But O
these O
gave O
place O
to O
a O
heavy O
swell O
; O
I O
felt O
sick O
, O
and O
hardly O
able O
to O
hold O
the O
rudder O
, O
when O
suddenly O
I O
saw O
a O
line O
of O
high O
land O
towards O
the O
south O
. O
Almost O
spent O
, O
as O
I O
was O
, O
by O
fatigue O
, O
and O
the O
dreadful O
suspense O
I O
endured O
for O
several O
hours O
, O
this O
sudden O
certainty O
of O
life O
rushed O
like O
a O
flood O
of O
warm O
joy O
to O
my O
heart O
, O
and O
tears O
gushed O
from O
my O
eyes O
. O
How O
mutable O
are O
our O
feelings O
, O
and O
how O
strange O
is O
that O
clinging O
love O
we O
have O
of O
life O
even O
in O
the O
excess O
of O
misery O
! O
I O
constructed O
another O
sail O
with O
a O
part O
of O
my O
dress O
, O
and O
eagerly O
steered O
my O
course O
towards O
the O
land O
. O
It O
had O
a O
wild O
and O
rocky O
appearance O
; O
but O
as O
I O
approached O
nearer O
, O
I O
easily O
perceived O
the O
traces O
of O
cultivation O
. O
I O
saw O
vessels O
near O
the O
shore O
, O
and O
found O
myself O
suddenly O
transported O
back O
to O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
civilized O
man O
. O
I O
eagerly O
traced O
the O
windings O
of O
the O
land O
, O
and O
hailed O
a O
steeple O
which O
I O
at O
length O
saw O
issuing O
from O
behind O
a O
small O
promontory O
. O
As O
I O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
extreme O
debility O
, O
I O
resolved O
to O
sail O
directly O
towards O
the O
town O
as O
a O
place O
where O
I O
could O
most O
easily O
procure O
nourishment O
. O
Fortunately O
I O
had O
money O
with O
me O
. O
As O
I O
turned O
the O
promontory O
, O
I O
perceived O
a O
small O
neat O
town O
and O
a O
good O
harbour O
, O
which O
I O
entered O
, O
my O
heart O
bounding O
with O
joy O
at O
my O
unexpected O
escape O
. O
As O
I O
was O
occupied O
in O
fixing O
the O
boat O
and O
arranging O
the O
sails O
, O
several O
people O
crowded O
towards O
the O
spot O
. O
They O
seemed O
very O
much O
surprised O
at O
my O
appearance O
; O
but O
, O
instead O
of O
offering O
me O
any O
assistance O
, O
whispered O
together O
with O
gestures O
that O
at O
any O
other O
time O
might O
have O
produced O
in O
me O
a O
slight O
sensation O
of O
alarm O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
I O
merely O
remarked O
that O
they O
spoke O
English O
; O
and O
I O
therefore O
addressed O
them O
in O
that O
language O
: O
" O
My O
good O
friends O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
will O
you O
be O
so O
kind O
as O
to O
tell O
me O
the O
name O
of O
this O
town O
, O
and O
inform O
me O
where O
I O
am O
? O
" O
" O
You O
will O
know O
that O
soon O
enough O
, O
" O
replied O
a O
man O
with O
a O
gruff O
voice O
. O
" O
May O
be O
you O
are O
come O
to O
a O
place O
that O
will O
not O
prove O
much O
to O
your O
taste O
; O
but O
you O
will O
not O
be O
consulted O
as O
to O
your O
quarters O
, O
I O
promise O
you O
. O
" O
I O
was O
exceedingly O
surprised O
on O
receiving O
so O
rude O
an O
answer O
from O
a O
stranger O
; O
and O
I O
was O
also O
disconcerted O
on O
perceiving O
the O
frowning O
and O
angry O
countenances O
of O
his O
companions O
. O
" O
Why O
do O
you O
answer O
me O
so O
roughly O
? O
" O
I O
replied O
: O
" O
surely O
it O
is O
not O
the O
custom O
of O
Englishmen O
to O
receive O
strangers O
so O
inhospitably O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
" O
said O
the O
man O
, O
" O
what O
the O
custom O
of O
the O
English O
may O
be O
; O
but O
it O
is O
the O
custom O
of O
the O
Irish O
to O
hate O
villains O
. O
" O
While O
this O
strange O
dialogue O
continued O
, O
I O
perceived O
the O
crowd O
rapidly O
increase O
. O
Their O
faces O
expressed O
a O
mixture O
of O
curiosity O
and O
anger O
, O
which O
annoyed O
, O
and O
in O
some O
degree O
alarmed O
me O
. O
I O
inquired O
the O
way O
to O
the O
inn O
; O
but O
no O
one O
replied O
. O
I O
then O
moved O
forward O
, O
and O
a O
murmuring O
sound O
arose O
from O
the O
crowd O
as O
they O
followed O
and O
surrounded O
me O
; O
when O
an O
ill-looking O
man O
approaching O
, O
tapped O
me O
on O
the O
shoulder O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Come O
, O
Sir O
, O
you O
must O
follow O
me O
to O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
's O
, O
to O
give O
an O
account O
of O
yourself O
. O
" O
" O
Who O
is O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
? O
Why O
am O
I O
to O
give O
an O
account O
of O
myself O
? O
Is O
not O
this O
a O
free O
country O
? O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
Sir O
, O
free O
enough O
for O
honest O
folks O
. O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
is O
a O
magistrate O
; O
and O
you O
are O
to O
give O
an O
account O
of O
the O
death O
of O
a O
gentleman O
who O
was O
found O
murdered O
here O
last O
night O
. O
" O
This O
answer O
startled O
me O
; O
but O
I O
presently O
recovered O
myself O
. O
I O
was O
innocent O
; O
that O
could O
easily O
be O
proved O
: O
accordingly O
I O
followed O
my O
conductor O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
was O
led O
to O
one O
of O
the O
best O
houses O
in O
the O
town O
. O
I O
was O
ready O
to O
sink O
from O
fatigue O
and O
hunger O
; O
but O
, O
being O
surrounded O
by O
a O
crowd O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
politic O
to O
rouse O
all O
my O
strength O
, O
that O
no O
physical O
debility O
might O
be O
construed O
into O
apprehension O
or O
conscious O
guilt O
. O
Little O
did O
I O
then O
expect O
the O
calamity O
that O
was O
in O
a O
few O
moments O
to O
overwhelm O
me O
, O
and O
extinguish O
in O
horror O
and O
despair O
all O
fear O
of O
ignominy O
or O
death O
. O
I O
must O
pause O
here O
; O
for O
it O
requires O
all O
my O
fortitude O
to O
recall O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
frightful O
events O
which O
I O
am O
about O
to O
relate O
, O
in O
proper O
detail O
, O
to O
my O
recollection O
. O
