I O
was O
soon O
introduced O
into O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
magistrate O
, O
an O
old O
benevolent O
man O
, O
with O
calm O
and O
mild O
manners O
. O
He O
looked O
upon O
me O
, O
however O
, O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
severity O
; O
and O
then O
, O
turning O
towards O
my O
conductors O
, O
he O
asked O
who O
appeared O
as O
witnesses O
on O
this O
occasion O
. O
About O
half O
a O
dozen O
men O
came O
forward O
; O
and O
one O
being O
selected O
by O
the O
magistrate O
, O
he O
deposed O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
out O
fishing O
the O
night O
before O
with O
his O
son O
and O
brother-in-law O
, O
Daniel O
Nugent O
, O
when O
, O
about O
ten O
o'clock O
, O
they O
observed O
a O
strong O
northerly O
blast O
rising O
, O
and O
they O
accordingly O
put O
in O
for O
port O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
dark O
night O
, O
as O
the O
moon O
had O
not O
yet O
risen O
; O
they O
did O
not O
land O
at O
the O
harbour O
, O
but O
, O
as O
they O
had O
been O
accustomed O
, O
at O
a O
creek O
about O
two O
miles O
below O
. O
He O
walked O
on O
first O
, O
carrying O
a O
part O
of O
the O
fishing O
tackle O
, O
and O
his O
companions O
followed O
him O
at O
some O
distance O
. O
As O
he O
was O
proceeding O
along O
the O
sands O
, O
he O
struck O
his O
foot O
against O
something O
, O
and O
fell O
all O
his O
length O
on O
the O
ground O
. O
His O
companions O
came O
up O
to O
assist O
him O
; O
and O
, O
by O
the O
light O
of O
their O
lantern O
, O
they O
found O
that O
he O
had O
fallen O
on O
the O
body O
of O
a O
man O
, O
who O
was O
to O
all O
appearance O
dead O
. O
Their O
first O
supposition O
was O
, O
that O
it O
was O
the O
corpse O
of O
some O
person O
who O
had O
been O
drowned O
, O
and O
was O
thrown O
on O
shore O
by O
the O
waves O
; O
but O
, O
upon O
examination O
, O
they O
found O
that O
the O
clothes O
were O
not O
wet O
, O
and O
even O
that O
the O
body O
was O
not O
then O
cold O
. O
They O
instantly O
carried O
it O
to O
the O
cottage O
of O
an O
old O
woman O
near O
the O
spot O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
, O
to O
restore O
it O
to O
life O
. O
He O
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
handsome O
young O
man O
, O
about O
five O
and O
twenty O
years O
of O
age O
. O
He O
had O
apparently O
been O
strangled O
; O
for O
there O
was O
no O
sign O
of O
any O
violence O
, O
except O
the O
black O
mark O
of O
fingers O
on O
his O
neck O
. O
The O
first O
part O
of O
this O
deposition O
did O
not O
in O
the O
least O
interest O
me O
; O
but O
when O
the O
mark O
of O
the O
fingers O
was O
mentioned O
, O
I O
remembered O
the O
murder O
of O
my O
brother O
, O
and O
felt O
myself O
extremely O
agitated O
; O
my O
limbs O
trembled O
, O
and O
a O
mist O
came O
over O
my O
eyes O
, O
which O
obliged O
me O
to O
lean O
on O
a O
chair O
for O
support O
. O
The O
magistrate O
observed O
me O
with O
a O
keen O
eye O
, O
and O
of O
course O
drew O
an O
unfavourable O
augury O
from O
my O
manner O
. O
The O
son O
confirmed O
his O
father O
's O
account O
: O
but O
when O
Daniel O
Nugent O
was O
called O
, O
he O
swore O
positively O
that O
, O
just O
before O
the O
fall O
of O
his O
companion O
, O
he O
saw O
a O
boat O
, O
with O
a O
single O
man O
in O
it O
, O
at O
a O
short O
distance O
from O
the O
shore O
; O
and O
, O
as O
far O
as O
he O
could O
judge O
by O
the O
light O
of O
a O
few O
stars O
, O
it O
was O
the O
same O
boat O
in O
which O
I O
had O
just O
landed O
. O
A O
woman O
deposed O
, O
that O
she O
lived O
near O
the O
beach O
, O
and O
was O
standing O
at O
the O
door O
of O
her O
cottage O
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
return O
of O
the O
fishermen O
, O
about O
an O
hour O
before O
she O
heard O
of O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
body O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
a O
boat O
, O
with O
only O
one O
man O
in O
it O
, O
push O
off O
from O
that O
part O
of O
the O
shore O
where O
the O
corpse O
was O
afterwards O
found O
. O
Another O
woman O
confirmed O
the O
account O
of O
the O
fishermen O
having O
brought O
the O
body O
into O
her O
house O
; O
it O
was O
not O
cold O
. O
They O
put O
it O
into O
a O
bed O
, O
and O
rubbed O
it O
; O
and O
Daniel O
went O
to O
the O
town O
for O
an O
apothecary O
, O
but O
life O
was O
quite O
gone O
. O
Several O
other O
men O
were O
examined O
concerning O
my O
landing O
; O
and O
they O
agreed O
, O
that O
, O
with O
the O
strong O
north O
wind O
that O
had O
arisen O
during O
the O
night O
, O
it O
was O
very O
probable O
that O
I O
had O
beaten O
about O
for O
many O
hours O
, O
and O
had O
been O
obliged O
to O
return O
nearly O
to O
the O
same O
spot O
from O
which O
I O
had O
departed O
. O
Besides O
, O
they O
observed O
that O
it O
appeared O
that O
I O
had O
brought O
the O
body O
from O
another O
place O
, O
and O
it O
was O
likely O
, O
that O
as O
I O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
know O
the O
shore O
, O
I O
might O
have O
put O
into O
the O
harbour O
ignorant O
of O
the O
distance O
of O
the O
town O
of O
—— O
from O
the O
place O
where O
I O
had O
deposited O
the O
corpse O
. O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
, O
on O
hearing O
this O
evidence O
, O
desired O
that O
I O
should O
be O
taken O
into O
the O
room O
where O
the O
body O
lay O
for O
interment O
that O
it O
might O
be O
observed O
what O
effect O
the O
sight O
of O
it O
would O
produce O
upon O
me O
. O
This O
idea O
was O
probably O
suggested O
by O
the O
extreme O
agitation O
I O
had O
exhibited O
when O
the O
mode O
of O
the O
murder O
had O
been O
described O
. O
I O
was O
accordingly O
conducted O
, O
by O
the O
magistrate O
and O
several O
other O
persons O
, O
to O
the O
inn O
. O
I O
could O
not O
help O
being O
struck O
by O
the O
strange O
coincidences O
that O
had O
taken O
place O
during O
this O
eventful O
night O
; O
but O
, O
knowing O
that O
I O
had O
been O
conversing O
with O
several O
persons O
in O
the O
island O
I O
had O
inhabited O
about O
the O
time O
that O
the O
body O
had O
been O
found O
, O
I O
was O
perfectly O
tranquil O
as O
to O
the O
consequences O
of O
the O
affair O
. O
I O
entered O
the O
room O
where O
the O
corpse O
lay O
, O
and O
was O
led O
up O
to O
the O
coffin O
. O
How O
can O
I O
describe O
my O
sensations O
on O
beholding O
it O
? O
I O
feel O
yet O
parched O
with O
horror O
, O
nor O
can O
I O
reflect O
on O
that O
terrible O
moment O
without O
shuddering O
and O
agony O
, O
that O
faintly O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
anguish O
of O
the O
recognition O
. O
The O
trial O
, O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
magistrate O
and O
witnesses O
, O
passed O
like O
a O
dream O
from O
my O
memory O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
the O
lifeless O
form O
of O
Henry O
Clerval O
stretched O
before O
me O
. O
I O
gasped O
for O
breath O
; O
and O
, O
throwing O
myself O
on O
the O
body O
, O
I O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
Have O
my O
murderous O
machinations O
deprived O
you O
also O
, O
my O
dearest O
Henry O
, O
of O
life O
? O
Two O
I O
have O
already O
destroyed O
; O
other O
victims O
await O
their O
destiny O
: O
but O
you O
, O
Clerval O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
my O
benefactor O
" O
—— O
The O
human O
frame O
could O
no O
longer O
support O
the O
agonizing O
suffering O
that O
I O
endured O
, O
and O
I O
was O
carried O
out O
of O
the O
room O
in O
strong O
convulsions O
. O
A O
fever O
succeeded O
to O
this O
. O
I O
lay O
for O
two O
months O
on O
the O
point O
of O
death O
: O
my O
ravings O
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
heard O
, O
were O
frightful O
; O
I O
called O
myself O
the O
murderer O
of O
William O
, O
of O
Justine O
, O
and O
of O
Clerval O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
entreated O
my O
attendants O
to O
assist O
me O
in O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
fiend O
by O
whom O
I O
was O
tormented O
; O
and O
, O
at O
others O
, O
I O
felt O
the O
fingers O
of O
the O
monster O
already O
grasping O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
screamed O
aloud O
with O
agony O
and O
terror O
. O
Fortunately O
, O
as O
I O
spoke O
my O
native O
language O
, O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
alone O
understood O
me O
; O
but O
my O
gestures O
and O
bitter O
cries O
were O
sufficient O
to O
affright O
the O
other O
witnesses O
. O
Why O
did O
I O
not O
die O
? O
More O
miserable O
than O
man O
ever O
was O
before O
, O
why O
did O
I O
not O
sink O
into O
forgetfulness O
and O
rest O
? O
Death O
snatches O
away O
many O
blooming O
children O
, O
the O
only O
hopes O
of O
their O
doating O
parents O
: O
how O
many O
brides O
and O
youthful O
lovers O
have O
been O
one O
day O
in O
the O
bloom O
of O
health O
and O
hope O
, O
and O
the O
next O
a O
prey O
for O
worms O
and O
the O
decay O
of O
the O
tomb O
! O
Of O
what O
materials O
was O
I O
made O
, O
that O
I O
could O
thus O
resist O
so O
many O
shocks O
, O
which O
, O
like O
the O
turning O
of O
the O
wheel O
, O
continually O
renewed O
the O
torture O
. O
But O
I O
was O
doomed O
to O
live O
; O
and O
, O
in O
two O
months O
, O
found O
myself O
as O
awaking O
from O
a O
dream O
, O
in O
a O
prison O
, O
stretched O
on O
a O
wretched O
bed O
, O
surrounded O
by O
gaolers O
, O
turnkeys O
, O
bolts O
, O
and O
all O
the O
miserable O
apparatus O
of O
a O
dungeon O
. O
It O
was O
morning O
, O
I O
remember O
, O
when O
I O
thus O
awoke O
to O
understanding O
: O
I O
had O
forgotten O
the O
particulars O
of O
what O
had O
happened O
, O
and O
only O
felt O
as O
if O
some O
great O
misfortune O
had O
suddenly O
overwhelmed O
me O
; O
but O
when O
I O
looked O
around O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
barred O
windows O
, O
and O
the O
squalidness O
of O
the O
room O
in O
which O
I O
was O
, O
all O
flashed O
across O
my O
memory O
, O
and O
I O
groaned O
bitterly O
. O
This O
sound O
disturbed O
an O
old O
woman O
who O
was O
sleeping O
in O
a O
chair O
beside O
me O
. O
She O
was O
a O
hired O
nurse O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
one O
of O
the O
turnkeys O
, O
and O
her O
countenance O
expressed O
all O
those O
bad O
qualities O
which O
often O
characterize O
that O
class O
. O
The O
lines O
of O
her O
face O
were O
hard O
and O
rude O
, O
like O
that O
of O
persons O
accustomed O
to O
see O
without O
sympathizing O
in O
sights O
of O
misery O
. O
Her O
tone O
expressed O
her O
entire O
indifference O
; O
she O
addressed O
me O
in O
English O
, O
and O
the O
voice O
struck O
me O
as O
one O
that O
I O
had O
heard O
during O
my O
sufferings O
: O
" O
Are O
you O
better O
now O
, O
Sir O
? O
" O
said O
she O
. O
I O
replied O
in O
the O
same O
language O
, O
with O
a O
feeble O
voice O
, O
" O
I O
believe O
I O
am O
; O
but O
if O
it O
be O
all O
true O
, O
if O
indeed O
I O
did O
not O
dream O
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
that O
I O
am O
still O
alive O
to O
feel O
this O
misery O
and O
horror O
. O
" O
" O
For O
that O
matter O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
old O
woman O
, O
" O
if O
you O
mean O
about O
the O
gentleman O
you O
murdered O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
were O
better O
for O
you O
if O
you O
were O
dead O
, O
for O
I O
fancy O
it O
will O
go O
hard O
with O
you O
; O
but O
you O
will O
be O
hung O
when O
the O
next O
sessions O
come O
on O
. O
However O
, O
that O
's O
none O
of O
my O
business O
, O
I O
am O
sent O
to O
nurse O
you O
, O
and O
get O
you O
well O
; O
I O
do O
my O
duty O
with O
a O
safe O
conscience O
, O
it O
were O
well O
if O
every O
body O
did O
the O
same O
. O
" O
I O
turned O
with O
loathing O
from O
the O
woman O
who O
could O
utter O
so O
unfeeling O
a O
speech O
to O
a O
person O
just O
saved O
, O
on O
the O
very O
edge O
of O
death O
; O
but O
I O
felt O
languid O
, O
and O
unable O
to O
reflect O
on O
all O
that O
had O
passed O
. O
The O
whole O
series O
of O
my O
life O
appeared O
to O
me O
as O
a O
dream O
; O
I O
sometimes O
doubted O
if O
indeed O
it O
were O
all O
true O
, O
for O
it O
never O
presented O
itself O
to O
my O
mind O
with O
the O
force O
of O
reality O
. O
As O
the O
images O
that O
floated O
before O
me O
became O
more O
distinct O
, O
I O
grew O
feverish O
; O
a O
darkness O
pressed O
around O
me O
; O
no O
one O
was O
near O
me O
who O
soothed O
me O
with O
the O
gentle O
voice O
of O
love O
; O
no O
dear O
hand O
supported O
me O
. O
The O
physician O
came O
and O
prescribed O
medicines O
, O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
prepared O
them O
for O
me O
; O
but O
utter O
carelessness O
was O
visible O
in O
the O
first O
, O
and O
the O
expression O
of O
brutality O
was O
strongly O
marked O
in O
the O
visage O
of O
the O
second O
. O
Who O
could O
be O
interested O
in O
the O
fate O
of O
a O
murderer O
, O
but O
the O
hangman O
who O
would O
gain O
his O
fee O
? O
These O
were O
my O
first O
reflections O
; O
but O
I O
soon O
learned O
that O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
had O
shewn O
me O
extreme O
kindness O
. O
He O
had O
caused O
the O
best O
room O
in O
the O
prison O
to O
be O
prepared O
for O
me O
( O
wretched O
indeed O
was O
the O
best O
) O
; O
and O
it O
was O
he O
who O
had O
provided O
a O
physician O
and O
a O
nurse O
. O
It O
is O
true O
, O
he O
seldom O
came O
to O
see O
me O
; O
for O
, O
although O
he O
ardently O
desired O
to O
relieve O
the O
sufferings O
of O
every O
human O
creature O
, O
he O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
be O
present O
at O
the O
agonies O
and O
miserable O
ravings O
of O
a O
murderer O
. O
He O
came O
, O
therefore O
, O
sometimes O
to O
see O
that O
I O
was O
not O
neglected O
; O
but O
his O
visits O
were O
short O
, O
and O
at O
long O
intervals O
. O
One O
day O
, O
when O
I O
was O
gradually O
recovering O
, O
I O
was O
seated O
in O
a O
chair O
, O
my O
eyes O
half O
open O
, O
and O
my O
cheeks O
livid O
like O
those O
in O
death O
, O
I O
was O
overcome O
by O
gloom O
and O
misery O
, O
and O
often O
reflected O
I O
had O
better O
seek O
death O
than O
remain O
miserably O
pent O
up O
only O
to O
be O
let O
loose O
in O
a O
world O
replete O
with O
wretchedness O
. O
At O
one O
time O
I O
considered O
whether O
I O
should O
not O
declare O
myself O
guilty O
, O
and O
suffer O
the O
penalty O
of O
the O
law O
, O
less O
innocent O
than O
poor O
Justine O
had O
been O
. O
Such O
were O
my O
thoughts O
, O
when O
the O
door O
of O
my O
apartment O
was O
opened O
, O
and O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
entered O
. O
His O
countenance O
expressed O
sympathy O
and O
compassion O
; O
he O
drew O
a O
chair O
close O
to O
mine O
, O
and O
addressed O
me O
in O
French— O
" O
I O
fear O
that O
this O
place O
is O
very O
shocking O
to O
you O
; O
can O
I O
do O
any O
thing O
to O
make O
you O
more O
comfortable O
? O
" O
" O
I O
thank O
you O
; O
but O
all O
that O
you O
mention O
is O
nothing O
to O
me O
: O
on O
the O
whole O
earth O
there O
is O
no O
comfort O
which O
I O
am O
capable O
of O
receiving O
. O
" O
" O
I O
know O
that O
the O
sympathy O
of O
a O
stranger O
can O
be O
but O
of O
little O
relief O
to O
one O
borne O
down O
as O
you O
are O
by O
so O
strange O
a O
misfortune O
. O
But O
you O
will O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
soon O
quit O
this O
melancholy O
abode O
; O
for O
, O
doubtless O
, O
evidence O
can O
easily O
be O
brought O
to O
free O
you O
from O
the O
criminal O
charge O
. O
" O
" O
That O
is O
my O
least O
concern O
: O
I O
am O
, O
by O
a O
course O
of O
strange O
events O
, O
become O
the O
most O
miserable O
of O
mortals O
. O
Persecuted O
and O
tortured O
as O
I O
am O
and O
have O
been O
, O
can O
death O
be O
any O
evil O
to O
me O
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
indeed O
could O
be O
more O
unfortunate O
and O
agonizing O
than O
the O
strange O
chances O
that O
have O
lately O
occurred O
. O
You O
were O
thrown O
, O
by O
some O
surprising O
accident O
, O
on O
this O
shore O
, O
renowned O
for O
its O
hospitality O
: O
seized O
immediately O
, O
and O
charged O
with O
murder O
. O
The O
first O
sight O
that O
was O
presented O
to O
your O
eyes O
was O
the O
body O
of O
your O
friend O
, O
murdered O
in O
so O
unaccountable O
a O
manner O
, O
and O
placed O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
by O
some O
fiend O
across O
your O
path O
. O
" O
As O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
said O
this O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
agitation O
I O
endured O
on O
this O
retrospect O
of O
my O
sufferings O
, O
I O
also O
felt O
considerable O
surprise O
at O
the O
knowledge O
he O
seemed O
to O
possess O
concerning O
me O
. O
I O
suppose O
some O
astonishment O
was O
exhibited O
in O
my O
countenance O
; O
for O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
hastened O
to O
say— O
" O
It O
was O
not O
until O
a O
day O
or O
two O
after O
your O
illness O
that O
I O
thought O
of O
examining O
your O
dress O
, O
that O
I O
might O
discover O
some O
trace O
by O
which O
I O
could O
send O
to O
your O
relations O
an O
account O
of O
your O
misfortune O
and O
illness O
. O
I O
found O
several O
letters O
, O
and O
, O
among O
others O
, O
one O
which O
I O
discovered O
from O
its O
commencement O
to O
be O
from O
your O
father O
. O
I O
instantly O
wrote O
to O
Geneva O
: O
nearly O
two O
months O
have O
elapsed O
since O
the O
departure O
of O
my O
letter.—But O
you O
are O
ill O
; O
even O
now O
you O
tremble O
: O
you O
are O
unfit O
for O
agitation O
of O
any O
kind O
. O
" O
" O
This O
suspense O
is O
a O
thousand O
times O
worse O
than O
the O
most O
horrible O
event O
: O
tell O
me O
what O
new O
scene O
of O
death O
has O
been O
acted O
, O
and O
whose O
murder O
I O
am O
now O
to O
lament O
. O
" O
" O
Your O
family O
is O
perfectly O
well O
, O
" O
said O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
, O
with O
gentleness O
; O
" O
and O
some O
one O
, O
a O
friend O
, O
is O
come O
to O
visit O
you O
. O
" O
I O
know O
not O
by O
what O
chain O
of O
thought O
the O
idea O
presented O
itself O
, O
but O
it O
instantly O
darted O
into O
my O
mind O
that O
the O
murderer O
had O
come O
to O
mock O
at O
my O
misery O
, O
and O
taunt O
me O
with O
the O
death O
of O
Clerval O
, O
as O
a O
new O
incitement O
for O
me O
to O
comply O
with O
his O
hellish O
desires O
. O
I O
put O
my O
hand O
before O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
cried O
out O
in O
agony— O
" O
Oh O
! O
take O
him O
away O
! O
I O
can O
not O
see O
him O
; O
for O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
do O
not O
let O
him O
enter O
! O
" O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
regarded O
me O
with O
a O
troubled O
countenance O
. O
He O
could O
not O
help O
regarding O
my O
exclamation O
as O
a O
presumption O
of O
my O
guilt O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
rather O
a O
severe O
tone— O
" O
I O
should O
have O
thought O
, O
young O
man O
, O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
your O
father O
would O
have O
been O
welcome O
, O
instead O
of O
inspiring O
such O
violent O
repugnance O
. O
" O
" O
My O
father O
! O
" O
cried O
I O
, O
while O
every O
feature O
and O
every O
muscle O
was O
relaxed O
from O
anguish O
to O
pleasure O
. O
" O
Is O
my O
father O
, O
indeed O
, O
come O
? O
How O
kind O
, O
how O
very O
kind O
. O
But O
where O
is O
he O
, O
why O
does O
he O
not O
hasten O
to O
me O
? O
" O
My O
change O
of O
manner O
surprised O
and O
pleased O
the O
magistrate O
; O
perhaps O
he O
thought O
that O
my O
former O
exclamation O
was O
a O
momentary O
return O
of O
delirium O
, O
and O
now O
he O
instantly O
resumed O
his O
former O
benevolence O
. O
He O
rose O
, O
and O
quitted O
the O
room O
with O
my O
nurse O
, O
and O
in O
a O
moment O
my O
father O
entered O
it O
. O
Nothing O
, O
at O
this O
moment O
, O
could O
have O
given O
me O
greater O
pleasure O
than O
the O
arrival O
of O
my O
father O
. O
I O
stretched O
out O
my O
hand O
to O
him O
, O
and O
cried— O
" O
Are O
you O
then O
safe—and O
Elizabeth—and O
Ernest O
? O
" O
My O
father O
calmed O
me O
with O
assurances O
of O
their O
welfare O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
, O
by O
dwelling O
on O
these O
subjects O
so O
interesting O
to O
my O
heart O
, O
to O
raise O
my O
desponding O
spirits O
; O
but O
he O
soon O
felt O
that O
a O
prison O
can O
not O
be O
the O
abode O
of O
cheerfulness O
. O
" O
What O
a O
place O
is O
this O
that O
you O
inhabit O
, O
my O
son O
! O
" O
said O
he O
, O
looking O
mournfully O
at O
the O
barred O
windows O
, O
and O
wretched O
appearance O
of O
the O
room O
. O
" O
You O
travelled O
to O
seek O
happiness O
, O
but O
a O
fatality O
seems O
to O
pursue O
you O
. O
And O
poor O
Clerval— O
" O
The O
name O
of O
my O
unfortunate O
and O
murdered O
friend O
was O
an O
agitation O
too O
great O
to O
be O
endured O
in O
my O
weak O
state O
; O
I O
shed O
tears O
. O
" O
Alas O
! O
yes O
, O
my O
father O
, O
" O
replied O
I O
; O
" O
some O
destiny O
of O
the O
most O
horrible O
kind O
hangs O
over O
me O
, O
and O
I O
must O
live O
to O
fulfil O
it O
, O
or O
surely O
I O
should O
have O
died O
on O
the O
coffin O
of O
Henry O
. O
" O
We O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
converse O
for O
any O
length O
of O
time O
, O
for O
the O
precarious O
state O
of O
my O
health O
rendered O
every O
precaution O
necessary O
that O
could O
insure O
tranquillity O
. O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
came O
in O
, O
and O
insisted O
that O
my O
strength O
should O
not O
be O
exhausted O
by O
too O
much O
exertion O
. O
But O
the O
appearance O
of O
my O
father O
was O
to O
me O
like O
that O
of O
my O
good O
angel O
, O
and O
I O
gradually O
recovered O
my O
health O
. O
As O
my O
sickness O
quitted O
me O
, O
I O
was O
absorbed O
by O
a O
gloomy O
and O
black O
melancholy O
, O
that O
nothing O
could O
dissipate O
. O
The O
image O
of O
Clerval O
was O
for O
ever O
before O
me O
, O
ghastly O
and O
murdered O
. O
More O
than O
once O
the O
agitation O
into O
which O
these O
reflections O
threw O
me O
made O
my O
friends O
dread O
a O
dangerous O
relapse O
. O
Alas O
! O
why O
did O
they O
preserve O
so O
miserable O
and O
detested O
a O
life O
? O
It O
was O
surely O
that O
I O
might O
fulfil O
my O
destiny O
, O
which O
is O
now O
drawing O
to O
a O
close O
. O
Soon O
, O
oh O
, O
very O
soon O
, O
will O
death O
extinguish O
these O
throbbings O
, O
and O
relieve O
me O
from O
the O
mighty O
weight O
of O
anguish O
that O
bears O
me O
to O
the O
dust O
; O
and O
, O
in O
executing O
the O
award O
of O
justice O
, O
I O
shall O
also O
sink O
to O
rest O
. O
Then O
the O
appearance O
of O
death O
was O
distant O
, O
although O
the O
wish O
was O
ever O
present O
to O
my O
thoughts O
; O
and O
I O
often O
sat O
for O
hours O
motionless O
and O
speechless O
, O
wishing O
for O
some O
mighty O
revolution O
that O
might O
bury O
me O
and O
my O
destroyer O
in O
its O
ruins O
. O
The O
season O
of O
the O
assizes O
approached O
. O
I O
had O
already O
been O
three O
months O
in O
prison O
; O
and O
although O
I O
was O
still O
weak O
, O
and O
in O
continual O
danger O
of O
a O
relapse O
, O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
travel O
nearly O
a O
hundred O
miles O
to O
the O
county-town O
, O
where O
the O
court O
was O
held O
. O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
charged O
himself O
with O
every O
care O
of O
collecting O
witnesses O
, O
and O
arranging O
my O
defence O
. O
I O
was O
spared O
the O
disgrace O
of O
appearing O
publicly O
as O
a O
criminal O
, O
as O
the O
case O
was O
not O
brought O
before O
the O
court O
that O
decides O
on O
life O
and O
death O
. O
The O
grand O
jury O
rejected O
the O
bill O
, O
on O
its O
being O
proved O
that O
I O
was O
on O
the O
Orkney O
Islands O
at O
the O
hour O
the O
body O
of O
my O
friend O
was O
found O
, O
and O
a O
fortnight O
after O
my O
removal O
I O
was O
liberated O
from O
prison O
. O
My O
father O
was O
enraptured O
on O
finding O
me O
freed O
from O
the O
vexations O
of O
a O
criminal O
charge O
, O
that O
I O
was O
again O
allowed O
to O
breathe O
the O
fresh O
atmosphere O
, O
and O
allowed O
to O
return O
to O
my O
native O
country O
. O
I O
did O
not O
participate O
in O
these O
feelings O
; O
for O
to O
me O
the O
walls O
of O
a O
dungeon O
or O
a O
palace O
were O
alike O
hateful O
. O
The O
cup O
of O
life O
was O
poisoned O
for O
ever O
; O
and O
although O
the O
sun O
shone O
upon O
me O
, O
as O
upon O
the O
happy O
and O
gay O
of O
heart O
, O
I O
saw O
around O
me O
nothing O
but O
a O
dense O
and O
frightful O
darkness O
, O
penetrated O
by O
no O
light O
but O
the O
glimmer O
of O
two O
eyes O
that O
glared O
upon O
me O
. O
Sometimes O
they O
were O
the O
expressive O
eyes O
of O
Henry O
, O
languishing O
in O
death O
, O
the O
dark O
orbs O
nearly O
covered O
by O
the O
lids O
, O
and O
the O
long O
black O
lashes O
that O
fringed O
them O
; O
sometimes O
it O
was O
the O
watery O
clouded O
eyes O
of O
the O
monster O
, O
as O
I O
first O
saw O
them O
in O
my O
chamber O
at O
Ingolstadt O
. O
My O
father O
tried O
to O
awaken O
in O
me O
the O
feelings O
of O
affection O
. O
He O
talked O
of O
Geneva O
, O
which O
I O
should O
soon O
visit—of O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
Ernest O
; O
but O
these O
words O
only O
drew O
deep O
groans O
from O
me O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
felt O
a O
wish O
for O
happiness O
; O
and O
thought O
, O
with O
melancholy O
delight O
, O
of O
my O
beloved O
cousin O
; O
or O
longed O
, O
with O
a O
devouring O
_maladie O
du O
pays_ O
, O
to O
see O
once O
more O
the O
blue O
lake O
and O
rapid O
Rhone O
, O
that O
had O
been O
so O
dear O
to O
me O
in O
early O
childhood O
: O
but O
my O
general O
state O
of O
feeling O
was O
a O
torpor O
, O
in O
which O
a O
prison O
was O
as O
welcome O
a O
residence O
as O
the O
divinest O
scene O
in O
nature O
; O
and O
these O
fits O
were O
seldom O
interrupted O
, O
but O
by O
paroxysms O
of O
anguish O
and O
despair O
. O
At O
these O
moments O
I O
often O
endeavoured O
to O
put O
an O
end O
to O
the O
existence O
I O
loathed O
; O
and O
it O
required O
unceasing O
attendance O
and O
vigilance O
to O
restrain O
me O
from O
committing O
some O
dreadful O
act O
of O
violence O
. O
I O
remember O
, O
as O
I O
quitted O
the O
prison O
, O
I O
heard O
one O
of O
the O
men O
say O
, O
" O
He O
may O
be O
innocent O
of O
the O
murder O
, O
but O
he O
has O
certainly O
a O
bad O
conscience O
. O
" O
These O
words O
struck O
me O
. O
A O
bad O
conscience O
! O
yes O
, O
surely O
I O
had O
one O
. O
William O
, O
Justine O
, O
and O
Clerval O
, O
had O
died O
through O
my O
infernal O
machinations O
; O
" O
And O
whose O
death O
, O
" O
cried O
I O
, O
" O
is O
to O
finish O
the O
tragedy O
? O
Ah O
! O
my O
father O
, O
do O
not O
remain O
in O
this O
wretched O
country O
; O
take O
me O
where O
I O
may O
forget O
myself O
, O
my O
existence O
, O
and O
all O
the O
world O
. O
" O
My O
father O
easily O
acceded O
to O
my O
desire O
; O
and O
, O
after O
having O
taken O
leave O
of O
Mr. O
Kirwin O
, O
we O
hastened O
to O
Dublin O
. O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
was O
relieved O
from O
a O
heavy O
weight O
, O
when O
the O
packet O
sailed O
with O
a O
fair O
wind O
from O
Ireland O
, O
and O
I O
had O
quitted O
for O
ever O
the O
country O
which O
had O
been O
to O
me O
the O
scene O
of O
so O
much O
misery O
. O
It O
was O
midnight O
. O
My O
father O
slept O
in O
the O
cabin O
; O
and O
I O
lay O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
looking O
at O
the O
stars O
, O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
dashing O
of O
the O
waves O
. O
I O
hailed O
the O
darkness O
that O
shut O
Ireland O
from O
my O
sight O
, O
and O
my O
pulse O
beat O
with O
a O
feverish O
joy O
, O
when O
I O
reflected O
that O
I O
should O
soon O
see O
Geneva O
. O
The O
past O
appeared O
to O
me O
in O
the O
light O
of O
a O
frightful O
dream O
; O
yet O
the O
vessel O
in O
which O
I O
was O
, O
the O
wind O
that O
blew O
me O
from O
the O
detested O
shore O
of O
Ireland O
, O
and O
the O
sea O
which O
surrounded O
me O
, O
told O
me O
too O
forcibly O
that O
I O
was O
deceived O
by O
no O
vision O
, O
and O
that O
Clerval O
, O
my O
friend O
and O
dearest O
companion O
, O
had O
fallen O
a O
victim O
to O
me O
and O
the O
monster O
of O
my O
creation O
. O
I O
repassed O
, O
in O
my O
memory O
, O
my O
whole O
life O
; O
my O
quiet O
happiness O
while O
residing O
with O
my O
family O
in O
Geneva O
, O
the O
death O
of O
my O
mother O
, O
and O
my O
departure O
for O
Ingolstadt O
. O
I O
remembered O
shuddering O
at O
the O
mad O
enthusiasm O
that O
hurried O
me O
on O
to O
the O
creation O
of O
my O
hideous O
enemy O
, O
and O
I O
called O
to O
mind O
the O
night O
during O
which O
he O
first O
lived O
. O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
pursue O
the O
train O
of O
thought O
; O
a O
thousand O
feelings O
pressed O
upon O
me O
, O
and O
I O
wept O
bitterly O
. O
Ever O
since O
my O
recovery O
from O
the O
fever O
I O
had O
been O
in O
the O
custom O
of O
taking O
every O
night O
a O
small O
quantity O
of O
laudanum O
; O
for O
it O
was O
by O
means O
of O
this O
drug O
only O
that O
I O
was O
enabled O
to O
gain O
the O
rest O
necessary O
for O
the O
preservation O
of O
life O
. O
Oppressed O
by O
the O
recollection O
of O
my O
various O
misfortunes O
, O
I O
now O
took O
a O
double O
dose O
, O
and O
soon O
slept O
profoundly O
. O
But O
sleep O
did O
not O
afford O
me O
respite O
from O
thought O
and O
misery O
; O
my O
dreams O
presented O
a O
thousand O
objects O
that O
scared O
me O
. O
Towards O
morning O
I O
was O
possessed O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
night-mare O
; O
I O
felt O
the O
fiend O
's O
grasp O
in O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
could O
not O
free O
myself O
from O
it O
; O
groans O
and O
cries O
rung O
in O
my O
ears O
. O
My O
father O
, O
who O
was O
watching O
over O
me O
, O
perceiving O
my O
restlessness O
, O
awoke O
me O
, O
and O
pointed O
to O
the O
port O
of O
Holyhead O
, O
which O
we O
were O
now O
entering O
. O
