" O
I O
lay O
on O
my O
straw O
, O
but O
I O
could O
not O
sleep O
. O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
occurrences O
of O
the O
day O
. O
What O
chiefly O
struck O
me O
was O
the O
gentle O
manners O
of O
these O
people O
; O
and O
I O
longed O
to O
join O
them O
, O
but O
dared O
not O
. O
I O
remembered O
too O
well O
the O
treatment O
I O
had O
suffered O
the O
night O
before O
from O
the O
barbarous O
villagers O
, O
and O
resolved O
, O
whatever O
course O
of O
conduct O
I O
might O
hereafter O
think O
it O
right O
to O
pursue O
, O
that O
for O
the O
present O
I O
would O
remain O
quietly O
in O
my O
hovel O
, O
watching O
, O
and O
endeavouring O
to O
discover O
the O
motives O
which O
influenced O
their O
actions O
. O
" O
The O
cottagers O
arose O
the O
next O
morning O
before O
the O
sun O
. O
The O
young O
woman O
arranged O
the O
cottage O
, O
and O
prepared O
the O
food O
; O
and O
the O
youth O
departed O
after O
the O
first O
meal O
. O
" O
This O
day O
was O
passed O
in O
the O
same O
routine O
as O
that O
which O
preceded O
it O
. O
The O
young O
man O
was O
constantly O
employed O
out O
of O
doors O
, O
and O
the O
girl O
in O
various O
laborious O
occupations O
within O
. O
The O
old O
man O
, O
whom O
I O
soon O
perceived O
to O
be O
blind O
, O
employed O
his O
leisure O
hours O
on O
his O
instrument O
, O
or O
in O
contemplation O
. O
Nothing O
could O
exceed O
the O
love O
and O
respect O
which O
the O
younger O
cottagers O
exhibited O
towards O
their O
venerable O
companion O
. O
They O
performed O
towards O
him O
every O
little O
office O
of O
affection O
and O
duty O
with O
gentleness O
; O
and O
he O
rewarded O
them O
by O
his O
benevolent O
smiles O
. O
" O
They O
were O
not O
entirely O
happy O
. O
The O
young O
man O
and O
his O
companion O
often O
went O
apart O
, O
and O
appeared O
to O
weep O
. O
I O
saw O
no O
cause O
for O
their O
unhappiness O
; O
but O
I O
was O
deeply O
affected O
by O
it O
. O
If O
such O
lovely O
creatures O
were O
miserable O
, O
it O
was O
less O
strange O
that O
I O
, O
an O
imperfect O
and O
solitary O
being O
, O
should O
be O
wretched O
. O
Yet O
why O
were O
these O
gentle O
beings O
unhappy O
? O
They O
possessed O
a O
delightful O
house O
( O
for O
such O
it O
was O
in O
my O
eyes O
) O
, O
and O
every O
luxury O
; O
they O
had O
a O
fire O
to O
warm O
them O
when O
chill O
, O
and O
delicious O
viands O
when O
hungry O
; O
they O
were O
dressed O
in O
excellent O
clothes O
; O
and O
, O
still O
more O
, O
they O
enjoyed O
one O
another O
's O
company O
and O
speech O
, O
interchanging O
each O
day O
looks O
of O
affection O
and O
kindness O
. O
What O
did O
their O
tears O
imply O
? O
Did O
they O
really O
express O
pain O
? O
I O
was O
at O
first O
unable O
to O
solve O
these O
questions O
; O
but O
perpetual O
attention O
, O
and O
time O
, O
explained O
to O
me O
many O
appearances O
which O
were O
at O
first O
enigmatic O
. O
" O
A O
considerable O
period O
elapsed O
before O
I O
discovered O
one O
of O
the O
causes O
of O
the O
uneasiness O
of O
this O
amiable O
family O
; O
it O
was O
poverty O
: O
and O
they O
suffered O
that O
evil O
in O
a O
very O
distressing O
degree O
. O
Their O
nourishment O
consisted O
entirely O
of O
the O
vegetables O
of O
their O
garden O
, O
and O
the O
milk O
of O
one O
cow O
, O
who O
gave O
very O
little O
during O
the O
winter O
, O
when O
its O
masters O
could O
scarcely O
procure O
food O
to O
support O
it O
. O
They O
often O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
suffered O
the O
pangs O
of O
hunger O
very O
poignantly O
, O
especially O
the O
two O
younger O
cottagers O
; O
for O
several O
times O
they O
placed O
food O
before O
the O
old O
man O
, O
when O
they O
reserved O
none O
for O
themselves O
. O
" O
This O
trait O
of O
kindness O
moved O
me O
sensibly O
. O
I O
had O
been O
accustomed O
, O
during O
the O
night O
, O
to O
steal O
a O
part O
of O
their O
store O
for O
my O
own O
consumption O
; O
but O
when O
I O
found O
that O
in O
doing O
this O
I O
inflicted O
pain O
on O
the O
cottagers O
, O
I O
abstained O
, O
and O
satisfied O
myself O
with O
berries O
, O
nuts O
, O
and O
roots O
, O
which O
I O
gathered O
from O
a O
neighbouring O
wood O
. O
" O
I O
discovered O
also O
another O
means O
through O
which O
I O
was O
enabled O
to O
assist O
their O
labours O
. O
I O
found O
that O
the O
youth O
spent O
a O
great O
part O
of O
each O
day O
in O
collecting O
wood O
for O
the O
family O
fire O
; O
and O
, O
during O
the O
night O
, O
I O
often O
took O
his O
tools O
, O
the O
use O
of O
which O
I O
quickly O
discovered O
, O
and O
brought O
home O
firing O
sufficient O
for O
the O
consumption O
of O
several O
days O
. O
" O
I O
remember O
, O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
did O
this O
, O
the O
young O
woman O
, O
when O
she O
opened O
the O
door O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
appeared O
greatly O
astonished O
on O
seeing O
a O
great O
pile O
of O
wood O
on O
the O
outside O
. O
She O
uttered O
some O
words O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
and O
the O
youth O
joined O
her O
, O
who O
also O
expressed O
surprise O
. O
I O
observed O
, O
with O
pleasure O
, O
that O
he O
did O
not O
go O
to O
the O
forest O
that O
day O
, O
but O
spent O
it O
in O
repairing O
the O
cottage O
, O
and O
cultivating O
the O
garden O
. O
" O
By O
degrees O
I O
made O
a O
discovery O
of O
still O
greater O
moment O
. O
I O
found O
that O
these O
people O
possessed O
a O
method O
of O
communicating O
their O
experience O
and O
feelings O
to O
one O
another O
by O
articulate O
sounds O
. O
I O
perceived O
that O
the O
words O
they O
spoke O
sometimes O
produced O
pleasure O
or O
pain O
, O
smiles O
or O
sadness O
, O
in O
the O
minds O
and O
countenances O
of O
the O
hearers O
. O
This O
was O
indeed O
a O
godlike O
science O
, O
and O
I O
ardently O
desired O
to O
become O
acquainted O
with O
it O
. O
But O
I O
was O
baffled O
in O
every O
attempt O
I O
made O
for O
this O
purpose O
. O
Their O
pronunciation O
was O
quick O
; O
and O
the O
words O
they O
uttered O
, O
not O
having O
any O
apparent O
connexion O
with O
visible O
objects O
, O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
discover O
any O
clue O
by O
which O
I O
could O
unravel O
the O
mystery O
of O
their O
reference O
. O
By O
great O
application O
, O
however O
, O
and O
after O
having O
remained O
during O
the O
space O
of O
several O
revolutions O
of O
the O
moon O
in O
my O
hovel O
, O
I O
discovered O
the O
names O
that O
were O
given O
to O
some O
of O
the O
most O
familiar O
objects O
of O
discourse O
: O
I O
learned O
and O
applied O
the O
words O
_fire_ O
, O
_milk_ O
, O
_bread_ O
, O
and O
_wood_ O
. O
I O
learned O
also O
the O
names O
of O
the O
cottagers O
themselves O
. O
The O
youth O
and O
his O
companion O
had O
each O
of O
them O
several O
names O
, O
but O
the O
old O
man O
had O
only O
one O
, O
which O
was O
_father_ O
. O
The O
girl O
was O
called O
_sister_ O
, O
or O
_Agatha_ O
; O
and O
the O
youth O
_Felix_ O
, O
_brother_ O
, O
or O
_son_ O
. O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
the O
delight O
I O
felt O
when O
I O
learned O
the O
ideas O
appropriated O
to O
each O
of O
these O
sounds O
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
pronounce O
them O
. O
I O
distinguished O
several O
other O
words O
, O
without O
being O
able O
as O
yet O
to O
understand O
or O
apply O
them O
; O
such O
as O
_good_ O
, O
_dearest_ O
, O
_unhappy_ O
. O
" O
I O
spent O
the O
winter O
in O
this O
manner O
. O
The O
gentle O
manners O
and O
beauty O
of O
the O
cottagers O
greatly O
endeared O
them O
to O
me O
: O
when O
they O
were O
unhappy O
, O
I O
felt O
depressed O
; O
when O
they O
rejoiced O
, O
I O
sympathized O
in O
their O
joys O
. O
I O
saw O
few O
human O
beings O
beside O
them O
; O
and O
if O
any O
other O
happened O
to O
enter O
the O
cottage O
, O
their O
harsh O
manners O
and O
rude O
gait O
only O
enhanced O
to O
me O
the O
superior O
accomplishments O
of O
my O
friends O
. O
The O
old O
man O
, O
I O
could O
perceive O
, O
often O
endeavoured O
to O
encourage O
his O
children O
, O
as O
sometimes O
I O
found O
that O
he O
called O
them O
, O
to O
cast O
off O
their O
melancholy O
. O
He O
would O
talk O
in O
a O
cheerful O
accent O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
goodness O
that O
bestowed O
pleasure O
even O
upon O
me O
. O
Agatha O
listened O
with O
respect O
, O
her O
eyes O
sometimes O
filled O
with O
tears O
, O
which O
she O
endeavoured O
to O
wipe O
away O
unperceived O
; O
but O
I O
generally O
found O
that O
her O
countenance O
and O
tone O
were O
more O
cheerful O
after O
having O
listened O
to O
the O
exhortations O
of O
her O
father O
. O
It O
was O
not O
thus O
with O
Felix O
. O
He O
was O
always O
the O
saddest O
of O
the O
groupe O
; O
and O
, O
even O
to O
my O
unpractised O
senses O
, O
he O
appeared O
to O
have O
suffered O
more O
deeply O
than O
his O
friends O
. O
But O
if O
his O
countenance O
was O
more O
sorrowful O
, O
his O
voice O
was O
more O
cheerful O
than O
that O
of O
his O
sister O
, O
especially O
when O
he O
addressed O
the O
old O
man O
. O
" O
I O
could O
mention O
innumerable O
instances O
, O
which O
, O
although O
slight O
, O
marked O
the O
dispositions O
of O
these O
amiable O
cottagers O
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
poverty O
and O
want O
, O
Felix O
carried O
with O
pleasure O
to O
his O
sister O
the O
first O
little O
white O
flower O
that O
peeped O
out O
from O
beneath O
the O
snowy O
ground O
. O
Early O
in O
the O
morning O
before O
she O
had O
risen O
, O
he O
cleared O
away O
the O
snow O
that O
obstructed O
her O
path O
to O
the O
milk-house O
, O
drew O
water O
from O
the O
well O
, O
and O
brought O
the O
wood O
from O
the O
out-house O
, O
where O
, O
to O
his O
perpetual O
astonishment O
, O
he O
found O
his O
store O
always O
replenished O
by O
an O
invisible O
hand O
. O
In O
the O
day O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
he O
worked O
sometimes O
for O
a O
neighbouring O
farmer O
, O
because O
he O
often O
went O
forth O
, O
and O
did O
not O
return O
until O
dinner O
, O
yet O
brought O
no O
wood O
with O
him O
. O
At O
other O
times O
he O
worked O
in O
the O
garden O
; O
but O
, O
as O
there O
was O
little O
to O
do O
in O
the O
frosty O
season O
, O
he O
read O
to O
the O
old O
man O
and O
Agatha O
. O
" O
This O
reading O
had O
puzzled O
me O
extremely O
at O
first O
; O
but O
, O
by O
degrees O
, O
I O
discovered O
that O
he O
uttered O
many O
of O
the O
same O
sounds O
when O
he O
read O
as O
when O
he O
talked O
. O
I O
conjectured O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
he O
found O
on O
the O
paper O
signs O
for O
speech O
which O
he O
understood O
, O
and O
I O
ardently O
longed O
to O
comprehend O
these O
also O
; O
but O
how O
was O
that O
possible O
, O
when O
I O
did O
not O
even O
understand O
the O
sounds O
for O
which O
they O
stood O
as O
signs O
? O
I O
improved O
, O
however O
, O
sensibly O
in O
this O
science O
, O
but O
not O
sufficiently O
to O
follow O
up O
any O
kind O
of O
conversation O
, O
although O
I O
applied O
my O
whole O
mind O
to O
the O
endeavour O
: O
for O
I O
easily O
perceived O
that O
, O
although O
I O
eagerly O
longed O
to O
discover O
myself O
to O
the O
cottagers O
, O
I O
ought O
not O
to O
make O
the O
attempt O
until O
I O
had O
first O
become O
master O
of O
their O
language O
; O
which O
knowledge O
might O
enable O
me O
to O
make O
them O
overlook O
the O
deformity O
of O
my O
figure O
; O
for O
with O
this O
also O
the O
contrast O
perpetually O
presented O
to O
my O
eyes O
had O
made O
me O
acquainted O
. O
" O
I O
had O
admired O
the O
perfect O
forms O
of O
my O
cottagers—their O
grace O
, O
beauty O
, O
and O
delicate O
complexions O
: O
but O
how O
was O
I O
terrified O
, O
when O
I O
viewed O
myself O
in O
a O
transparent O
pool O
! O
At O
first O
I O
started O
back O
, O
unable O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
was O
indeed O
I O
who O
was O
reflected O
in O
the O
mirror O
; O
and O
when O
I O
became O
fully O
convinced O
that O
I O
was O
in O
reality O
the O
monster O
that O
I O
am O
, O
I O
was O
filled O
with O
the O
bitterest O
sensations O
of O
despondence O
and O
mortification O
. O
Alas O
! O
I O
did O
not O
yet O
entirely O
know O
the O
fatal O
effects O
of O
this O
miserable O
deformity O
. O
" O
As O
the O
sun O
became O
warmer O
, O
and O
the O
light O
of O
day O
longer O
, O
the O
snow O
vanished O
, O
and O
I O
beheld O
the O
bare O
trees O
and O
the O
black O
earth O
. O
From O
this O
time O
Felix O
was O
more O
employed O
; O
and O
the O
heart-moving O
indications O
of O
impending O
famine O
disappeared O
. O
Their O
food O
, O
as O
I O
afterwards O
found O
, O
was O
coarse O
, O
but O
it O
was O
wholesome O
; O
and O
they O
procured O
a O
sufficiency O
of O
it O
. O
Several O
new O
kinds O
of O
plants O
sprung O
up O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
which O
they O
dressed O
; O
and O
these O
signs O
of O
comfort O
increased O
daily O
as O
the O
season O
advanced O
. O
" O
The O
old O
man O
, O
leaning O
on O
his O
son O
, O
walked O
each O
day O
at O
noon O
, O
when O
it O
did O
not O
rain O
, O
as O
I O
found O
it O
was O
called O
when O
the O
heavens O
poured O
forth O
its O
waters O
. O
This O
frequently O
took O
place O
; O
but O
a O
high O
wind O
quickly O
dried O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
the O
season O
became O
far O
more O
pleasant O
than O
it O
had O
been O
. O
" O
My O
mode O
of O
life O
in O
my O
hovel O
was O
uniform O
. O
During O
the O
morning O
I O
attended O
the O
motions O
of O
the O
cottagers O
; O
and O
when O
they O
were O
dispersed O
in O
various O
occupations O
, O
I O
slept O
: O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
day O
was O
spent O
in O
observing O
my O
friends O
. O
When O
they O
had O
retired O
to O
rest O
, O
if O
there O
was O
any O
moon O
, O
or O
the O
night O
was O
star-light O
, O
I O
went O
into O
the O
woods O
, O
and O
collected O
my O
own O
food O
and O
fuel O
for O
the O
cottage O
. O
When O
I O
returned O
, O
as O
often O
as O
it O
was O
necessary O
, O
I O
cleared O
their O
path O
from O
the O
snow O
, O
and O
performed O
those O
offices O
that O
I O
had O
seen O
done O
by O
Felix O
. O
I O
afterwards O
found O
that O
these O
labours O
, O
performed O
by O
an O
invisible O
hand O
, O
greatly O
astonished O
them O
; O
and O
once O
or O
twice O
I O
heard O
them O
, O
on O
these O
occasions O
, O
utter O
the O
words O
_good O
spirit_ O
, O
_wonderful_ O
; O
but O
I O
did O
not O
then O
understand O
the O
signification O
of O
these O
terms O
. O
" O
My O
thoughts O
now O
became O
more O
active O
, O
and O
I O
longed O
to O
discover O
the O
motives O
and O
feelings O
of O
these O
lovely O
creatures O
; O
I O
was O
inquisitive O
to O
know O
why O
Felix O
appeared O
so O
miserable O
, O
and O
Agatha O
so O
sad O
. O
I O
thought O
( O
foolish O
wretch O
! O
) O
that O
it O
might O
be O
in O
my O
power O
to O
restore O
happiness O
to O
these O
deserving O
people O
. O
When O
I O
slept O
, O
or O
was O
absent O
, O
the O
forms O
of O
the O
venerable O
blind O
father O
, O
the O
gentle O
Agatha O
, O
and O
the O
excellent O
Felix O
, O
flitted O
before O
me O
. O
I O
looked O
upon O
them O
as O
superior O
beings O
, O
who O
would O
be O
the O
arbiters O
of O
my O
future O
destiny O
. O
I O
formed O
in O
my O
imagination O
a O
thousand O
pictures O
of O
presenting O
myself O
to O
them O
, O
and O
their O
reception O
of O
me O
. O
I O
imagined O
that O
they O
would O
be O
disgusted O
, O
until O
, O
by O
my O
gentle O
demeanour O
and O
conciliating O
words O
, O
I O
should O
first O
win O
their O
favour O
, O
and O
afterwards O
their O
love O
. O
" O
These O
thoughts O
exhilarated O
me O
, O
and O
led O
me O
to O
apply O
with O
fresh O
ardour O
to O
the O
acquiring O
the O
art O
of O
language O
. O
My O
organs O
were O
indeed O
harsh O
, O
but O
supple O
; O
and O
although O
my O
voice O
was O
very O
unlike O
the O
soft O
music O
of O
their O
tones O
, O
yet O
I O
pronounced O
such O
words O
as O
I O
understood O
with O
tolerable O
ease O
. O
It O
was O
as O
the O
ass O
and O
the O
lap-dog O
; O
yet O
surely O
the O
gentle O
ass O
, O
whose O
intentions O
were O
affectionate O
, O
although O
his O
manners O
were O
rude O
, O
deserved O
better O
treatment O
than O
blows O
and O
execration O
. O
" O
The O
pleasant O
showers O
and O
genial O
warmth O
of O
spring O
greatly O
altered O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
Men O
, O
who O
before O
this O
change O
seemed O
to O
have O
been O
hid O
in O
caves O
, O
dispersed O
themselves O
, O
and O
were O
employed O
in O
various O
arts O
of O
cultivation O
. O
The O
birds O
sang O
in O
more O
cheerful O
notes O
, O
and O
the O
leaves O
began O
to O
bud O
forth O
on O
the O
trees O
. O
Happy O
, O
happy O
earth O
! O
fit O
habitation O
for O
gods O
, O
which O
, O
so O
short O
a O
time O
before O
, O
was O
bleak O
, O
damp O
, O
and O
unwholesome O
. O
My O
spirits O
were O
elevated O
by O
the O
enchanting O
appearance O
of O
nature O
; O
the O
past O
was O
blotted O
from O
my O
memory O
, O
the O
present O
was O
tranquil O
, O
and O
the O
future O
gilded O
by O
bright O
rays O
of O
hope O
, O
and O
anticipations O
of O
joy O
