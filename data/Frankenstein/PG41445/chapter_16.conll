" O
I O
now O
hasten O
to O
the O
more O
moving O
part O
of O
my O
story O
. O
I O
shall O
relate O
events O
that O
impressed O
me O
with O
feelings O
which O
, O
from O
what O
I O
was O
, O
have O
made O
me O
what O
I O
am O
. O
" O
Spring O
advanced O
rapidly O
; O
the O
weather O
became O
fine O
, O
and O
the O
skies O
cloudless O
. O
It O
surprised O
me O
, O
that O
what O
before O
was O
desert O
and O
gloomy O
should O
now O
bloom O
with O
the O
most O
beautiful O
flowers O
and O
verdure O
. O
My O
senses O
were O
gratified O
and O
refreshed O
by O
a O
thousand O
scents O
of O
delight O
, O
and O
a O
thousand O
sights O
of O
beauty O
. O
" O
It O
was O
on O
one O
of O
these O
days O
, O
when O
my O
cottagers O
periodically O
rested O
from O
labour—the O
old O
man O
played O
on O
his O
guitar O
, O
and O
the O
children O
listened O
to O
him—I O
observed O
that O
the O
countenance O
of O
Felix O
was O
melancholy O
beyond O
expression O
: O
he O
sighed O
frequently O
; O
and O
once O
his O
father O
paused O
in O
his O
music O
, O
and O
I O
conjectured O
by O
his O
manner O
that O
he O
inquired O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
son O
's O
sorrow O
. O
Felix O
replied O
in O
a O
cheerful O
accent O
, O
and O
the O
old O
man O
was O
recommencing O
his O
music O
, O
when O
some O
one O
tapped O
at O
the O
door O
. O
" O
It O
was O
a O
lady O
on O
horseback O
, O
accompanied O
by O
a O
countryman O
as O
a O
guide O
. O
The O
lady O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
dark O
suit O
, O
and O
covered O
with O
a O
thick O
black O
veil O
. O
Agatha O
asked O
a O
question O
; O
to O
which O
the O
stranger O
only O
replied O
by O
pronouncing O
, O
in O
a O
sweet O
accent O
, O
the O
name O
of O
Felix O
. O
Her O
voice O
was O
musical O
, O
but O
unlike O
that O
of O
either O
of O
my O
friends O
. O
On O
hearing O
this O
word O
, O
Felix O
came O
up O
hastily O
to O
the O
lady O
; O
who O
, O
when O
she O
saw O
him O
, O
threw O
up O
her O
veil O
, O
and O
I O
beheld O
a O
countenance O
of O
angelic O
beauty O
and O
expression O
. O
Her O
hair O
of O
a O
shining O
raven O
black O
, O
and O
curiously O
braided O
; O
her O
eyes O
were O
dark O
, O
but O
gentle O
, O
although O
animated O
; O
her O
features O
of O
a O
regular O
proportion O
, O
and O
her O
complexion O
wondrously O
fair O
, O
each O
cheek O
tinged O
with O
a O
lovely O
pink O
. O
" O
Felix O
seemed O
ravished O
with O
delight O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
every O
trait O
of O
sorrow O
vanished O
from O
his O
face O
, O
and O
it O
instantly O
expressed O
a O
degree O
of O
ecstatic O
joy O
, O
of O
which O
I O
could O
hardly O
have O
believed O
it O
capable O
; O
his O
eyes O
sparkled O
, O
as O
his O
cheek O
flushed O
with O
pleasure O
; O
and O
at O
that O
moment O
I O
thought O
him O
as O
beautiful O
as O
the O
stranger O
. O
She O
appeared O
affected O
by O
different O
feelings O
; O
wiping O
a O
few O
tears O
from O
her O
lovely O
eyes O
, O
she O
held O
out O
her O
hand O
to O
Felix O
, O
who O
kissed O
it O
rapturously O
, O
and O
called O
her O
, O
as O
well O
as O
I O
could O
distinguish O
, O
his O
sweet O
Arabian O
. O
She O
did O
not O
appear O
to O
understand O
him O
, O
but O
smiled O
. O
He O
assisted O
her O
to O
dismount O
, O
and O
, O
dismissing O
her O
guide O
, O
conducted O
her O
into O
the O
cottage O
. O
Some O
conversation O
took O
place O
between O
him O
and O
his O
father O
; O
and O
the O
young O
stranger O
knelt O
at O
the O
old O
man O
's O
feet O
, O
and O
would O
have O
kissed O
his O
hand O
, O
but O
he O
raised O
her O
, O
and O
embraced O
her O
affectionately O
. O
" O
I O
soon O
perceived O
, O
that O
although O
the O
stranger O
uttered O
articulate O
sounds O
, O
and O
appeared O
to O
have O
a O
language O
of O
her O
own O
, O
she O
was O
neither O
understood O
by O
, O
or O
herself O
understood O
, O
the O
cottagers O
. O
They O
made O
many O
signs O
which O
I O
did O
not O
comprehend O
; O
but O
I O
saw O
that O
her O
presence O
diffused O
gladness O
through O
the O
cottage O
, O
dispelling O
their O
sorrow O
as O
the O
sun O
dissipates O
the O
morning O
mists O
. O
Felix O
seemed O
peculiarly O
happy O
, O
and O
with O
smiles O
of O
delight O
welcomed O
his O
Arabian O
. O
Agatha O
, O
the O
ever-gentle O
Agatha O
, O
kissed O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
lovely O
stranger O
; O
and O
, O
pointing O
to O
her O
brother O
, O
made O
signs O
which O
appeared O
to O
me O
to O
mean O
that O
he O
had O
been O
sorrowful O
until O
she O
came O
. O
Some O
hours O
passed O
thus O
, O
while O
they O
, O
by O
their O
countenances O
, O
expressed O
joy O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
which O
I O
did O
not O
comprehend O
. O
Presently O
I O
found O
, O
by O
the O
frequent O
recurrence O
of O
one O
sound O
which O
the O
stranger O
repeated O
after O
them O
, O
that O
she O
was O
endeavouring O
to O
learn O
their O
language O
; O
and O
the O
idea O
instantly O
occurred O
to O
me O
, O
that O
I O
should O
make O
use O
of O
the O
same O
instructions O
to O
the O
same O
end O
. O
The O
stranger O
learned O
about O
twenty O
words O
at O
the O
first O
lesson O
, O
most O
of O
them O
indeed O
were O
those O
which O
I O
had O
before O
understood O
, O
but O
I O
profited O
by O
the O
others O
. O
" O
As O
night O
came O
on O
, O
Agatha O
and O
the O
Arabian O
retired O
early O
. O
When O
they O
separated O
, O
Felix O
kissed O
the O
hand O
of O
the O
stranger O
, O
and O
said O
, O
'Good O
night O
, O
sweet O
Safie O
. O
' O
He O
sat O
up O
much O
longer O
, O
conversing O
with O
his O
father O
; O
and O
, O
by O
the O
frequent O
repetition O
of O
her O
name O
, O
I O
conjectured O
that O
their O
lovely O
guest O
was O
the O
subject O
of O
their O
conversation O
. O
I O
ardently O
desired O
to O
understand O
them O
, O
and O
bent O
every O
faculty O
towards O
that O
purpose O
, O
but O
found O
it O
utterly O
impossible O
. O
" O
The O
next O
morning O
Felix O
went O
out O
to O
his O
work O
; O
and O
, O
after O
the O
usual O
occupations O
of O
Agatha O
were O
finished O
, O
the O
Arabian O
sat O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
the O
old O
man O
, O
and O
, O
taking O
his O
guitar O
, O
played O
some O
airs O
so O
entrancingly O
beautiful O
, O
that O
they O
at O
once O
drew O
tears O
of O
sorrow O
and O
delight O
from O
my O
eyes O
. O
She O
sang O
, O
and O
her O
voice O
flowed O
in O
a O
rich O
cadence O
, O
swelling O
or O
dying O
away O
, O
like O
a O
nightingale O
of O
the O
woods O
. O
" O
When O
she O
had O
finished O
, O
she O
gave O
the O
guitar O
to O
Agatha O
, O
who O
at O
first O
declined O
it O
. O
She O
played O
a O
simple O
air O
, O
and O
her O
voice O
accompanied O
it O
in O
sweet O
accents O
, O
but O
unlike O
the O
wondrous O
strain O
of O
the O
stranger O
. O
The O
old O
man O
appeared O
enraptured O
, O
and O
said O
some O
words O
, O
which O
Agatha O
endeavoured O
to O
explain O
to O
Safie O
, O
and O
by O
which O
he O
appeared O
to O
wish O
to O
express O
that O
she O
bestowed O
on O
him O
the O
greatest O
delight O
by O
her O
music O
. O
" O
The O
days O
now O
passed O
as O
peaceably O
as O
before O
, O
with O
the O
sole O
alteration O
, O
that O
joy O
had O
taken O
place O
of O
sadness O
in O
the O
countenances O
of O
my O
friends O
. O
Safie O
was O
always O
gay O
and O
happy O
; O
she O
and O
I O
improved O
rapidly O
in O
the O
knowledge O
of O
language O
, O
so O
that O
in O
two O
months O
I O
began O
to O
comprehend O
most O
of O
the O
words O
uttered O
by O
my O
protectors O
. O
" O
In O
the O
meanwhile O
also O
the O
black O
ground O
was O
covered O
with O
herbage O
, O
and O
the O
green O
banks O
interspersed O
with O
innumerable O
flowers O
, O
sweet O
to O
the O
scent O
and O
the O
eyes O
, O
stars O
of O
pale O
radiance O
among O
the O
moonlight O
woods O
; O
the O
sun O
became O
warmer O
, O
the O
nights O
clear O
and O
balmy O
; O
and O
my O
nocturnal O
rambles O
were O
an O
extreme O
pleasure O
to O
me O
, O
although O
they O
were O
considerably O
shortened O
by O
the O
late O
setting O
and O
early O
rising O
of O
the O
sun O
; O
for O
I O
never O
ventured O
abroad O
during O
daylight O
, O
fearful O
of O
meeting O
with O
the O
same O
treatment O
as O
I O
had O
formerly O
endured O
in O
the O
first O
village O
which O
I O
entered O
. O
" O
My O
days O
were O
spent O
in O
close O
attention O
, O
that O
I O
might O
more O
speedily O
master O
the O
language O
; O
and O
I O
may O
boast O
that O
I O
improved O
more O
rapidly O
than O
the O
Arabian O
, O
who O
understood O
very O
little O
, O
and O
conversed O
in O
broken O
accents O
, O
whilst O
I O
comprehended O
and O
could O
imitate O
almost O
every O
word O
that O
was O
spoken O
. O
" O
While O
I O
improved O
in O
speech O
, O
I O
also O
learned O
the O
science O
of O
letters O
, O
as O
it O
was O
taught O
to O
the O
stranger O
; O
and O
this O
opened O
before O
me O
a O
wide O
field O
for O
wonder O
and O
delight O
. O
" O
The O
book O
from O
which O
Felix O
instructed O
Safie O
was O
Volney O
's O
_Ruins O
of O
Empires_ O
. O
I O
should O
not O
have O
understood O
the O
purport O
of O
this O
book O
, O
had O
not O
Felix O
, O
in O
reading O
it O
, O
given O
very O
minute O
explanations O
. O
He O
had O
chosen O
this O
work O
, O
he O
said O
, O
because O
the O
declamatory O
style O
was O
framed O
in O
imitation O
of O
the O
eastern O
authors O
. O
Through O
this O
work O
I O
obtained O
a O
cursory O
knowledge O
of O
history O
, O
and O
a O
view O
of O
the O
several O
empires O
at O
present O
existing O
in O
the O
world O
; O
it O
gave O
me O
an O
insight O
into O
the O
manners O
, O
governments O
, O
and O
religions O
of O
the O
different O
nations O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
I O
heard O
of O
the O
slothful O
Asiatics O
; O
of O
the O
stupendous O
genius O
and O
mental O
activity O
of O
the O
Grecians O
; O
of O
the O
wars O
and O
wonderful O
virtue O
of O
the O
early O
Romans—of O
their O
subsequent O
degeneration—of O
the O
decline O
of O
that O
mighty O
empire O
; O
of O
chivalry O
, O
Christianity O
, O
and O
kings O
. O
I O
heard O
of O
the O
discovery O
of O
the O
American O
hemisphere O
, O
and O
wept O
with O
Safie O
over O
the O
hapless O
fate O
of O
its O
original O
inhabitants O
. O
" O
These O
wonderful O
narrations O
inspired O
me O
with O
strange O
feelings O
. O
Was O
man O
, O
indeed O
, O
at O
once O
so O
powerful O
, O
so O
virtuous O
, O
and O
magnificent O
, O
yet O
so O
vicious O
and O
base O
? O
He O
appeared O
at O
one O
time O
a O
mere O
scion O
of O
the O
evil O
principle O
, O
and O
at O
another O
as O
all O
that O
can O
be O
conceived O
of O
noble O
and O
godlike O
. O
To O
be O
a O
great O
and O
virtuous O
man O
appeared O
the O
highest O
honour O
that O
can O
befall O
a O
sensitive O
being O
; O
to O
be O
base O
and O
vicious O
, O
as O
many O
on O
record O
have O
been O
, O
appeared O
the O
lowest O
degradation O
, O
a O
condition O
more O
abject O
than O
that O
of O
the O
blind O
mole O
or O
harmless O
worm O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
could O
not O
conceive O
how O
one O
man O
could O
go O
forth O
to O
murder O
his O
fellow O
, O
or O
even O
why O
there O
were O
laws O
and O
governments O
; O
but O
when O
I O
heard O
details O
of O
vice O
and O
bloodshed O
, O
my O
wonder O
ceased O
, O
and O
I O
turned O
away O
with O
disgust O
and O
loathing O
. O
" O
Every O
conversation O
of O
the O
cottagers O
now O
opened O
new O
wonders O
to O
me O
. O
While O
I O
listened O
to O
the O
instructions O
which O
Felix O
bestowed O
upon O
the O
Arabian O
, O
the O
strange O
system O
of O
human O
society O
was O
explained O
to O
me O
. O
I O
heard O
of O
the O
division O
of O
property O
, O
of O
immense O
wealth O
and O
squalid O
poverty O
; O
of O
rank O
, O
descent O
, O
and O
noble O
blood O
. O
" O
The O
words O
induced O
me O
to O
turn O
towards O
myself O
. O
I O
learned O
that O
the O
possessions O
most O
esteemed O
by O
your O
fellow-creatures O
were O
, O
high O
and O
unsullied O
descent O
united O
with O
riches O
. O
A O
man O
might O
be O
respected O
with O
only O
one O
of O
these O
acquisitions O
; O
but O
without O
either O
he O
was O
considered O
, O
except O
in O
very O
rare O
instances O
, O
as O
a O
vagabond O
and O
a O
slave O
, O
doomed O
to O
waste O
his O
powers O
for O
the O
profit O
of O
the O
chosen O
few O
. O
And O
what O
was O
I O
? O
Of O
my O
creation O
and O
creator O
I O
was O
absolutely O
ignorant O
; O
but O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
possessed O
no O
money O
, O
no O
friends O
, O
no O
kind O
of O
property O
. O
I O
was O
, O
besides O
, O
endowed O
with O
a O
figure O
hideously O
deformed O
and O
loathsome O
; O
I O
was O
not O
even O
of O
the O
same O
nature O
as O
man O
. O
I O
was O
more O
agile O
than O
they O
, O
and O
could O
subsist O
upon O
coarser O
diet O
; O
I O
bore O
the O
extremes O
of O
heat O
and O
cold O
with O
less O
injury O
to O
my O
frame O
; O
my O
stature O
far O
exceeded O
their O
's O
. O
When O
I O
looked O
around O
, O
I O
saw O
and O
heard O
of O
none O
like O
me O
. O
Was O
I O
then O
a O
monster O
, O
a O
blot O
upon O
the O
earth O
, O
from O
which O
all O
men O
fled O
, O
and O
whom O
all O
men O
disowned O
? O
" O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
to O
you O
the O
agony O
that O
these O
reflections O
inflicted O
upon O
me O
; O
I O
tried O
to O
dispel O
them O
, O
but O
sorrow O
only O
increased O
with O
knowledge O
. O
Oh O
, O
that O
I O
had O
for O
ever O
remained O
in O
my O
native O
wood O
, O
nor O
known O
or O
felt O
beyond O
the O
sensations O
of O
hunger O
, O
thirst O
, O
and O
heat O
! O
" O
Of O
what O
a O
strange O
nature O
is O
knowledge O
! O
It O
clings O
to O
the O
mind O
, O
when O
it O
has O
once O
seized O
on O
it O
, O
like O
a O
lichen O
on O
the O
rock O
. O
I O
wished O
sometimes O
to O
shake O
off O
all O
thought O
and O
feeling O
; O
but O
I O
learned O
that O
there O
was O
but O
one O
means O
to O
overcome O
the O
sensation O
of O
pain O
, O
and O
that O
was O
death—a O
state O
which O
I O
feared O
yet O
did O
not O
understand O
. O
I O
admired O
virtue O
and O
good O
feelings O
, O
and O
loved O
the O
gentle O
manners O
and O
amiable O
qualities O
of O
my O
cottagers O
; O
but O
I O
was O
shut O
out O
from O
intercourse O
with O
them O
, O
except O
through O
means O
which O
I O
obtained O
by O
stealth O
, O
when O
I O
was O
unseen O
and O
unknown O
, O
and O
which O
rather O
increased O
than O
satisfied O
the O
desire O
I O
had O
of O
becoming O
one O
among O
my O
fellows O
. O
The O
gentle O
words O
of O
Agatha O
, O
and O
the O
animated O
smiles O
of O
the O
charming O
Arabian O
, O
were O
not O
for O
me O
. O
The O
mild O
exhortations O
of O
the O
old O
man O
, O
and O
the O
lively O
conversation O
of O
the O
loved O
Felix O
, O
were O
not O
for O
me O
. O
Miserable O
, O
unhappy O
wretch O
! O
" O
Other O
lessons O
were O
impressed O
upon O
me O
even O
more O
deeply O
. O
I O
heard O
of O
the O
difference O
of O
sexes O
; O
of O
the O
birth O
and O
growth O
of O
children O
; O
how O
the O
father O
doated O
on O
the O
smiles O
of O
the O
infant O
, O
and O
the O
lively O
sallies O
of O
the O
older O
child O
; O
how O
all O
the O
life O
and O
cares O
of O
the O
mother O
were O
wrapt O
up O
in O
the O
precious O
charge O
; O
how O
the O
mind O
of O
youth O
expanded O
and O
gained O
knowledge O
; O
of O
brother O
, O
sister O
, O
and O
all O
the O
various O
relationships O
which O
bind O
one O
human O
being O
to O
another O
in O
mutual O
bonds O
. O
" O
But O
where O
were O
my O
friends O
and O
relations O
? O
No O
father O
had O
watched O
my O
infant O
days O
, O
no O
mother O
had O
blessed O
me O
with O
smiles O
and O
caresses O
; O
or O
if O
they O
had O
, O
all O
my O
past O
life O
was O
now O
a O
blot O
, O
a O
blind O
vacancy O
in O
which O
I O
distinguished O
nothing O
. O
From O
my O
earliest O
remembrance O
I O
had O
been O
as O
I O
then O
was O
in O
height O
and O
proportion O
. O
I O
had O
never O
yet O
seen O
a O
being O
resembling O
me O
, O
or O
who O
claimed O
any O
intercourse O
with O
me O
. O
What O
was O
I O
? O
The O
question O
again O
recurred O
, O
to O
be O
answered O
only O
with O
groans O
. O
" O
I O
will O
soon O
explain O
to O
what O
these O
feelings O
tended O
; O
but O
allow O
me O
now O
to O
return O
to O
the O
cottagers O
, O
whose O
story O
excited O
in O
me O
such O
various O
feelings O
of O
indignation O
, O
delight O
, O
and O
wonder O
, O
but O
which O
all O
terminated O
in O
additional O
love O
and O
reverence O
for O
my O
protectors O
( O
for O
so O
I O
loved O
, O
in O
an O
innocent O
, O
half O
painful O
self-deceit O
, O
to O
call O
them O
