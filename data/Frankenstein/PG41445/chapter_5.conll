I O
am O
by O
birth O
a O
Genevese O
; O
and O
my O
family O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
distinguished O
of O
that O
republic O
. O
My O
ancestors O
had O
been O
for O
many O
years O
counsellors O
and O
syndics O
; O
and O
my O
father O
had O
filled O
several O
public O
situations O
with O
honour O
and O
reputation O
. O
He O
was O
respected O
by O
all O
who O
knew O
him O
for O
his O
integrity O
and O
indefatigable O
attention O
to O
public O
business O
. O
He O
passed O
his O
younger O
days O
perpetually O
occupied O
by O
the O
affairs O
of O
his O
country O
; O
and O
it O
was O
not O
until O
the O
decline O
of O
life O
that O
he O
thought O
of O
marrying O
, O
and O
bestowing O
on O
the O
state O
sons O
who O
might O
carry O
his O
virtues O
and O
his O
name O
down O
to O
posterity O
. O
As O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O
marriage O
illustrate O
his O
character O
, O
I O
can O
not O
refrain O
from O
relating O
them O
. O
One O
of O
his O
most O
intimate O
friends O
was O
a O
merchant O
, O
who O
, O
from O
a O
flourishing O
state O
, O
fell O
, O
through O
numerous O
mischances O
, O
into O
poverty O
. O
This O
man O
, O
whose O
name O
was O
Beaufort O
, O
was O
of O
a O
proud O
and O
unbending O
disposition O
, O
and O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
live O
in O
poverty O
and O
oblivion O
in O
the O
same O
country O
where O
he O
had O
formerly O
been O
distinguished O
for O
his O
rank O
and O
magnificence O
. O
Having O
paid O
his O
debts O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
the O
most O
honourable O
manner O
, O
he O
retreated O
with O
his O
daughter O
to O
the O
town O
of O
Lucerne O
, O
where O
he O
lived O
unknown O
and O
in O
wretchedness O
. O
My O
father O
loved O
Beaufort O
with O
the O
truest O
friendship O
, O
and O
was O
deeply O
grieved O
by O
his O
retreat O
in O
these O
unfortunate O
circumstances O
. O
He O
grieved O
also O
for O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
society O
, O
and O
resolved O
to O
seek O
him O
out O
and O
endeavour O
to O
persuade O
him O
to O
begin O
the O
world O
again O
through O
his O
credit O
and O
assistance O
. O
Beaufort O
had O
taken O
effectual O
measures O
to O
conceal O
himself O
; O
and O
it O
was O
ten O
months O
before O
my O
father O
discovered O
his O
abode O
. O
Overjoyed O
at O
this O
discovery O
, O
he O
hastened O
to O
the O
house O
, O
which O
was O
situated O
in O
a O
mean O
street O
, O
near O
the O
Reuss O
. O
But O
when O
he O
entered O
, O
misery O
and O
despair O
alone O
welcomed O
him O
. O
Beaufort O
had O
saved O
but O
a O
very O
small O
sum O
of O
money O
from O
the O
wreck O
of O
his O
fortunes O
; O
but O
it O
was O
sufficient O
to O
provide O
him O
with O
sustenance O
for O
some O
months O
, O
and O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
he O
hoped O
to O
procure O
some O
respectable O
employment O
in O
a O
merchant O
's O
house O
. O
The O
interval O
was O
consequently O
spent O
in O
inaction O
; O
his O
grief O
only O
became O
more O
deep O
and O
rankling O
, O
when O
he O
had O
leisure O
for O
reflection O
; O
and O
at O
length O
it O
took O
so O
fast O
hold O
of O
his O
mind O
, O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
three O
months O
he O
lay O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
sickness O
, O
incapable O
of O
any O
exertion O
. O
His O
daughter O
attended O
him O
with O
the O
greatest O
tenderness O
; O
but O
she O
saw O
with O
despair O
that O
their O
little O
fund O
was O
rapidly O
decreasing O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
other O
prospect O
of O
support O
. O
But O
Caroline O
Beaufort O
possessed O
a O
mind O
of O
an O
uncommon O
mould O
; O
and O
her O
courage O
rose O
to O
support O
her O
in O
her O
adversity O
. O
She O
procured O
plain O
work O
; O
she O
plaited O
straw O
; O
and O
by O
various O
means O
contrived O
to O
earn O
a O
pittance O
scarcely O
sufficient O
to O
support O
life O
. O
Several O
months O
passed O
in O
this O
manner O
. O
Her O
father O
grew O
worse O
; O
her O
time O
was O
more O
entirely O
occupied O
in O
attending O
him O
; O
her O
means O
of O
subsistence O
decreased O
; O
and O
in O
the O
tenth O
month O
her O
father O
died O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
leaving O
her O
an O
orphan O
and O
a O
beggar O
. O
This O
last O
blow O
overcame O
her O
; O
and O
she O
knelt O
by O
Beaufort O
's O
coffin O
, O
weeping O
bitterly O
, O
when O
my O
father O
entered O
the O
chamber O
. O
He O
came O
like O
a O
protecting O
spirit O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
, O
who O
committed O
herself O
to O
his O
care O
, O
and O
after O
the O
interment O
of O
his O
friend O
he O
conducted O
her O
to O
Geneva O
, O
and O
placed O
her O
under O
the O
protection O
of O
a O
relation O
. O
Two O
years O
after O
this O
event O
Caroline O
became O
his O
wife O
. O
When O
my O
father O
became O
a O
husband O
and O
a O
parent O
, O
he O
found O
his O
time O
so O
occupied O
by O
the O
duties O
of O
his O
new O
situation O
, O
that O
he O
relinquished O
many O
of O
his O
public O
employments O
, O
and O
devoted O
himself O
to O
the O
education O
of O
his O
children O
. O
Of O
these O
I O
was O
the O
eldest O
, O
and O
the O
destined O
successor O
to O
all O
his O
labours O
and O
utility O
. O
No O
creature O
could O
have O
more O
tender O
parents O
than O
mine O
. O
My O
improvement O
and O
health O
were O
their O
constant O
care O
, O
especially O
as O
I O
remained O
for O
several O
years O
their O
only O
child O
. O
But O
before O
I O
continue O
my O
narrative O
, O
I O
must O
record O
an O
incident O
which O
took O
place O
when O
I O
was O
four O
years O
of O
age O
. O
My O
father O
had O
a O
sister O
, O
whom O
he O
tenderly O
loved O
, O
and O
who O
had O
married O
early O
in O
life O
an O
Italian O
gentleman O
. O
Soon O
after O
her O
marriage O
, O
she O
had O
accompanied O
her O
husband O
into O
her O
native O
country O
, O
and O
for O
some O
years O
my O
father O
had O
very O
little O
communication O
with O
her O
. O
About O
the O
time O
I O
mentioned O
she O
died O
; O
and O
a O
few O
months O
afterwards O
he O
received O
a O
letter O
from O
her O
husband O
, O
acquainting O
him O
with O
his O
intention O
of O
marrying O
an O
Italian O
lady O
, O
and O
requesting O
my O
father O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
the O
infant O
Elizabeth O
, O
the O
only O
child O
of O
his O
deceased O
sister O
. O
" O
It O
is O
my O
wish O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
that O
you O
should O
consider O
her O
as O
your O
own O
daughter O
, O
and O
educate O
her O
thus O
. O
Her O
mother O
's O
fortune O
is O
secured O
to O
her O
, O
the O
documents O
of O
which O
I O
will O
commit O
to O
your O
keeping O
. O
Reflect O
upon O
this O
proposition O
; O
and O
decide O
whether O
you O
would O
prefer O
educating O
your O
niece O
yourself O
to O
her O
being O
brought O
up O
by O
a O
stepmother O
. O
" O
My O
father O
did O
not O
hesitate O
, O
and O
immediately O
went O
to O
Italy O
, O
that O
he O
might O
accompany O
the O
little O
Elizabeth O
to O
her O
future O
home O
. O
I O
have O
often O
heard O
my O
mother O
say O
, O
that O
she O
was O
at O
that O
time O
the O
most O
beautiful O
child O
she O
had O
ever O
seen O
, O
and O
shewed O
signs O
even O
then O
of O
a O
gentle O
and O
affectionate O
disposition O
. O
These O
indications O
, O
and O
a O
desire O
to O
bind O
as O
closely O
as O
possible O
the O
ties O
of O
domestic O
love O
, O
determined O
my O
mother O
to O
consider O
Elizabeth O
as O
my O
future O
wife O
; O
a O
design O
which O
she O
never O
found O
reason O
to O
repent O
. O
From O
this O
time O
Elizabeth O
Lavenza O
became O
my O
playfellow O
, O
and O
, O
as O
we O
grew O
older O
, O
my O
friend O
. O
She O
was O
docile O
and O
good O
tempered O
, O
yet O
gay O
and O
playful O
as O
a O
summer O
insect O
. O
Although O
she O
was O
lively O
and O
animated O
, O
her O
feelings O
were O
strong O
and O
deep O
, O
and O
her O
disposition O
uncommonly O
affectionate O
. O
No O
one O
could O
better O
enjoy O
liberty O
, O
yet O
no O
one O
could O
submit O
with O
more O
grace O
than O
she O
did O
to O
constraint O
and O
caprice O
. O
Her O
imagination O
was O
luxuriant O
, O
yet O
her O
capability O
of O
application O
was O
great O
. O
Her O
person O
was O
the O
image O
of O
her O
mind O
; O
her O
hazel O
eyes O
, O
although O
as O
lively O
as O
a O
bird O
's O
, O
possessed O
an O
attractive O
softness O
. O
Her O
figure O
was O
light O
and O
airy O
; O
and O
, O
though O
capable O
of O
enduring O
great O
fatigue O
, O
she O
appeared O
the O
most O
fragile O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
. O
While O
I O
admired O
her O
understanding O
and O
fancy O
, O
I O
loved O
to O
tend O
on O
her O
, O
as O
I O
should O
on O
a O
favourite O
animal O
; O
and O
I O
never O
saw O
so O
much O
grace O
both O
of O
person O
and O
mind O
united O
to O
so O
little O
pretension O
. O
Every O
one O
adored O
Elizabeth O
. O
If O
the O
servants O
had O
any O
request O
to O
make O
, O
it O
was O
always O
through O
her O
intercession O
. O
We O
were O
strangers O
to O
any O
species O
of O
disunion O
and O
dispute O
; O
for O
although O
there O
was O
a O
great O
dissimilitude O
in O
our O
characters O
, O
there O
was O
an O
harmony O
in O
that O
very O
dissimilitude O
. O
I O
was O
more O
calm O
and O
philosophical O
than O
my O
companion O
; O
yet O
my O
temper O
was O
not O
so O
yielding O
. O
My O
application O
was O
of O
longer O
endurance O
; O
but O
it O
was O
not O
so O
severe O
whilst O
it O
endured O
. O
I O
delighted O
in O
investigating O
the O
facts O
relative O
to O
the O
actual O
world O
; O
she O
busied O
herself O
in O
following O
the O
aërial O
creations O
of O
the O
poets O
. O
The O
world O
was O
to O
me O
a O
secret O
, O
which O
I O
desired O
to O
discover O
; O
to O
her O
it O
was O
a O
vacancy O
, O
which O
she O
sought O
to O
people O
with O
imaginations O
of O
her O
own O
. O
My O
brothers O
were O
considerably O
younger O
than O
myself O
; O
but O
I O
had O
a O
friend O
in O
one O
of O
my O
schoolfellows O
, O
who O
compensated O
for O
this O
deficiency O
. O
Henry O
Clerval O
was O
the O
son O
of O
a O
merchant O
of O
Geneva O
, O
an O
intimate O
friend O
of O
my O
father O
. O
He O
was O
a O
boy O
of O
singular O
talent O
and O
fancy O
. O
I O
remember O
, O
when O
he O
was O
nine O
years O
old O
, O
he O
wrote O
a O
fairy O
tale O
, O
which O
was O
the O
delight O
and O
amazement O
of O
all O
his O
companions O
. O
His O
favourite O
study O
consisted O
in O
books O
of O
chivalry O
and O
romance O
; O
and O
when O
very O
young O
, O
I O
can O
remember O
, O
that O
we O
used O
to O
act O
plays O
composed O
by O
him O
out O
of O
these O
favourite O
books O
, O
the O
principal O
characters O
of O
which O
were O
Orlando O
, O
Robin O
Hood O
, O
Amadis O
, O
and O
St O
. O
George O
. O
No O
youth O
could O
have O
passed O
more O
happily O
than O
mine O
. O
My O
parents O
were O
indulgent O
, O
and O
my O
companions O
amiable O
. O
Our O
studies O
were O
never O
forced O
; O
and O
by O
some O
means O
we O
always O
had O
an O
end O
placed O
in O
view O
, O
which O
excited O
us O
to O
ardour O
in O
the O
prosecution O
of O
them O
. O
It O
was O
by O
this O
method O
, O
and O
not O
by O
emulation O
, O
that O
we O
were O
urged O
to O
application O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
not O
incited O
to O
apply O
herself O
to O
drawing O
, O
that O
her O
companions O
might O
not O
outstrip O
her O
; O
but O
through O
the O
desire O
of O
pleasing O
her O
aunt O
, O
by O
the O
representation O
of O
some O
favourite O
scene O
done O
by O
her O
own O
hand O
. O
We O
learned O
Latin O
and O
English O
, O
that O
we O
might O
read O
the O
writings O
in O
those O
languages O
; O
and O
so O
far O
from O
study O
being O
made O
odious O
to O
us O
through O
punishment O
, O
we O
loved O
application O
, O
and O
our O
amusements O
would O
have O
been O
the O
labours O
of O
other O
children O
. O
Perhaps O
we O
did O
not O
read O
so O
many O
books O
, O
or O
learn O
languages O
so O
quickly O
, O
as O
those O
who O
are O
disciplined O
according O
to O
the O
ordinary O
methods O
; O
but O
what O
we O
learned O
was O
impressed O
the O
more O
deeply O
on O
our O
memories O
. O
In O
this O
description O
of O
our O
domestic O
circle O
I O
include O
Henry O
Clerval O
; O
for O
he O
was O
constantly O
with O
us O
. O
He O
went O
to O
school O
with O
me O
, O
and O
generally O
passed O
the O
afternoon O
at O
our O
house O
; O
for O
being O
an O
only O
child O
, O
and O
destitute O
of O
companions O
at O
home O
, O
his O
father O
was O
well O
pleased O
that O
he O
should O
find O
associates O
at O
our O
house O
; O
and O
we O
were O
never O
completely O
happy O
when O
Clerval O
was O
absent O
. O
I O
feel O
pleasure O
in O
dwelling O
on O
the O
recollections O
of O
childhood O
, O
before O
misfortune O
had O
tainted O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
changed O
its O
bright O
visions O
of O
extensive O
usefulness O
into O
gloomy O
and O
narrow O
reflections O
upon O
self O
. O
But O
, O
in O
drawing O
the O
picture O
of O
my O
early O
days O
, O
I O
must O
not O
omit O
to O
record O
those O
events O
which O
led O
, O
by O
insensible O
steps O
to O
my O
after O
tale O
of O
misery O
: O
for O
when O
I O
would O
account O
to O
myself O
for O
the O
birth O
of O
that O
passion O
, O
which O
afterwards O
ruled O
my O
destiny O
, O
I O
find O
it O
arise O
, O
like O
a O
mountain O
river O
, O
from O
ignoble O
and O
almost O
forgotten O
sources O
; O
but O
, O
swelling O
as O
it O
proceeded O
, O
it O
became O
the O
torrent O
which O
, O
in O
its O
course O
, O
has O
swept O
away O
all O
my O
hopes O
and O
joys O
. O
Natural O
philosophy O
is O
the O
genius O
that O
has O
regulated O
my O
fate O
; O
I O
desire O
therefore O
, O
in O
this O
narration O
, O
to O
state O
those O
facts O
which O
led O
to O
my O
predilection O
for O
that O
science O
. O
When O
I O
was O
thirteen O
years O
of O
age O
, O
we O
all O
went O
on O
a O
party O
of O
pleasure O
to O
the O
baths O
near O
Thonon O
: O
the O
inclemency O
of O
the O
weather O
obliged O
us O
to O
remain O
a O
day O
confined O
to O
the O
inn O
. O
In O
this O
house O
I O
chanced O
to O
find O
a O
volume O
of O
the O
works O
of O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
. O
I O
opened O
it O
with O
apathy O
; O
the O
theory O
which O
he O
attempts O
to O
demonstrate O
, O
and O
the O
wonderful O
facts O
which O
he O
relates O
, O
soon O
changed O
this O
feeling O
into O
enthusiasm O
. O
A O
new O
light O
seemed O
to O
dawn O
upon O
my O
mind O
; O
and O
, O
bounding O
with O
joy O
, O
I O
communicated O
my O
discovery O
to O
my O
father O
. O
I O
can O
not O
help O
remarking O
here O
the O
many O
opportunities O
instructors O
possess O
of O
directing O
the O
attention O
of O
their O
pupils O
to O
useful O
knowledge O
, O
which O
they O
utterly O
neglect O
. O
My O
father O
looked O
carelessly O
at O
the O
title-page O
of O
my O
book O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Ah O
! O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
! O
My O
dear O
Victor O
, O
do O
not O
waste O
your O
time O
upon O
this O
; O
it O
is O
sad O
trash O
. O
" O
If O
, O
instead O
of O
this O
remark O
, O
my O
father O
had O
taken O
the O
pains O
, O
to O
explain O
to O
me O
, O
that O
the O
principles O
of O
Agrippa O
had O
been O
entirely O
exploded O
, O
and O
that O
a O
modern O
system O
of O
science O
had O
been O
introduced O
, O
which O
possessed O
much O
greater O
powers O
than O
the O
ancient O
, O
because O
the O
powers O
of O
the O
latter O
were O
chimerical O
, O
while O
those O
of O
the O
former O
were O
real O
and O
practical O
; O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
I O
should O
certainly O
have O
thrown O
Agrippa O
aside O
, O
and O
, O
with O
my O
imagination O
warmed O
as O
it O
was O
, O
should O
probably O
have O
applied O
myself O
to O
the O
more O
rational O
theory O
of O
chemistry O
which O
has O
resulted O
from O
modern O
discoveries O
. O
It O
is O
even O
possible O
, O
that O
the O
train O
of O
my O
ideas O
would O
never O
have O
received O
the O
fatal O
impulse O
that O
led O
to O
my O
ruin O
. O
But O
the O
cursory O
glance O
my O
father O
had O
taken O
of O
my O
volume O
by O
no O
means O
assured O
me O
that O
he O
was O
acquainted O
with O
its O
contents O
; O
and O
I O
continued O
to O
read O
with O
the O
greatest O
avidity O
. O
When O
I O
returned O
home O
, O
my O
first O
care O
was O
to O
procure O
the O
whole O
works O
of O
this O
author O
, O
and O
afterwards O
of O
Paracelsus O
and O
Albertus O
Magnus O
. O
I O
read O
and O
studied O
the O
wild O
fancies O
of O
these O
writers O
with O
delight O
; O
they O
appeared O
to O
me O
treasures O
known O
to O
few O
beside O
myself O
; O
and O
although O
I O
often O
wished O
to O
communicate O
these O
secret O
stores O
of O
knowledge O
to O
my O
father O
, O
yet O
his O
indefinite O
censure O
of O
my O
favourite O
Agrippa O
always O
withheld O
me O
. O
I O
disclosed O
my O
discoveries O
to O
Elizabeth O
, O
therefore O
, O
under O
a O
promise O
of O
strict O
secrecy O
; O
but O
she O
did O
not O
interest O
herself O
in O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
I O
was O
left O
by O
her O
to O
pursue O
my O
studies O
alone O
. O
It O
may O
appear O
very O
strange O
, O
that O
a O
disciple O
of O
Albertus O
Magnus O
should O
arise O
in O
the O
eighteenth O
century O
; O
but O
our O
family O
was O
not O
scientifical O
, O
and O
I O
had O
not O
attended O
any O
of O
the O
lectures O
given O
at O
the O
schools O
of O
Geneva O
. O
My O
dreams O
were O
therefore O
undisturbed O
by O
reality O
; O
and O
I O
entered O
with O
the O
greatest O
diligence O
into O
the O
search O
of O
the O
philosopher O
's O
stone O
and O
the O
elixir O
of O
life O
. O
But O
the O
latter O
obtained O
my O
most O
undivided O
attention O
: O
wealth O
was O
an O
inferior O
object O
; O
but O
what O
glory O
would O
attend O
the O
discovery O
, O
if O
I O
could O
banish O
disease O
from O
the O
human O
frame O
, O
and O
render O
man O
invulnerable O
to O
any O
but O
a O
violent O
death O
! O
Nor O
were O
these O
my O
only O
visions O
. O
The O
raising O
of O
ghosts O
or O
devils O
was O
a O
promise O
liberally O
accorded O
by O
my O
favourite O
authors O
, O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
which O
I O
most O
eagerly O
sought O
; O
and O
if O
my O
incantations O
were O
always O
unsuccessful O
, O
I O
attributed O
the O
failure O
rather O
to O
my O
own O
inexperience O
and O
mistake O
, O
than O
to O
a O
want O
of O
skill O
or O
fidelity O
in O
my O
instructors O
. O
The O
natural O
phænomena O
that O
take O
place O
every O
day O
before O
our O
eyes O
did O
not O
escape O
my O
examinations O
. O
Distillation O
, O
and O
the O
wonderful O
effects O
of O
steam O
, O
processes O
of O
which O
my O
favourite O
authors O
were O
utterly O
ignorant O
, O
excited O
my O
astonishment O
; O
but O
my O
utmost O
wonder O
was O
engaged O
by O
some O
experiments O
on O
an O
air-pump O
, O
which O
I O
saw O
employed O
by O
a O
gentleman O
whom O
we O
were O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
visiting O
. O
The O
ignorance O
of O
the O
early O
philosophers O
on O
these O
and O
several O
other O
points O
served O
to O
decrease O
their O
credit O
with O
me O
: O
but O
I O
could O
not O
entirely O
throw O
them O
aside O
, O
before O
some O
other O
system O
should O
occupy O
their O
place O
in O
my O
mind O
. O
When O
I O
was O
about O
fifteen O
years O
old O
, O
we O
had O
retired O
to O
our O
house O
near O
Belrive O
, O
when O
we O
witnessed O
a O
most O
violent O
and O
terrible O
thunder-storm O
. O
It O
advanced O
from O
behind O
the O
mountains O
of O
Jura O
; O
and O
the O
thunder O
burst O
at O
once O
with O
frightful O
loudness O
from O
various O
quarters O
of O
the O
heavens O
. O
I O
remained O
, O
while O
the O
storm O
lasted O
, O
watching O
its O
progress O
with O
curiosity O
and O
delight O
. O
As O
I O
stood O
at O
the O
door O
, O
on O
a O
sudden O
I O
beheld O
a O
stream O
of O
fire O
issue O
from O
an O
old O
and O
beautiful O
oak O
, O
which O
stood O
about O
twenty O
yards O
from O
our O
house O
; O
and O
so O
soon O
as O
the O
dazzling O
light O
vanished O
, O
the O
oak O
had O
disappeared O
, O
and O
nothing O
remained O
but O
a O
blasted O
stump O
. O
When O
we O
visited O
it O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
found O
the O
tree O
shattered O
in O
a O
singular O
manner O
. O
It O
was O
not O
splintered O
by O
the O
shock O
, O
but O
entirely O
reduced O
to O
thin O
ribbands O
of O
wood O
. O
I O
never O
beheld O
any O
thing O
so O
utterly O
destroyed O
. O
The O
catastrophe O
of O
this O
tree O
excited O
my O
extreme O
astonishment O
; O
and O
I O
eagerly O
inquired O
of O
my O
father O
the O
nature O
and O
origin O
of O
thunder O
and O
lightning O
. O
He O
replied O
, O
" O
Electricity O
; O
" O
describing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
various O
effects O
of O
that O
power O
. O
He O
constructed O
a O
small O
electrical O
machine O
, O
and O
exhibited O
a O
few O
experiments O
; O
he O
made O
also O
a O
kite O
, O
with O
a O
wire O
and O
string O
, O
which O
drew O
down O
that O
fluid O
from O
the O
clouds O
. O
This O
last O
stroke O
completed O
the O
overthrow O
of O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
, O
Albertus O
Magnus O
, O
and O
Paracelsus O
, O
who O
had O
so O
long O
reigned O
the O
lords O
of O
my O
imagination O
. O
But O
by O
some O
fatality O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
inclined O
to O
commence O
the O
study O
of O
any O
modern O
system O
; O
and O
this O
disinclination O
was O
influenced O
by O
the O
following O
circumstance O
. O
My O
father O
expressed O
a O
wish O
that O
I O
should O
attend O
a O
course O
of O
lectures O
upon O
natural O
philosophy O
, O
to O
which O
I O
cheerfully O
consented O
. O
Some O
accident O
prevented O
my O
attending O
these O
lectures O
until O
the O
course O
was O
nearly O
finished O
. O
The O
lecture O
, O
being O
therefore O
one O
of O
the O
last O
, O
was O
entirely O
incomprehensible O
to O
me O
. O
The O
professor O
discoursed O
with O
the O
greatest O
fluency O
of O
potassium O
and O
boron O
, O
of O
sulphates O
and O
oxyds O
, O
terms O
to O
which O
I O
could O
affix O
no O
idea O
; O
and O
I O
became O
disgusted O
with O
the O
science O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
, O
although O
I O
still O
read O
Pliny O
and O
Buffon O
with O
delight O
, O
authors O
, O
in O
my O
estimation O
, O
of O
nearly O
equal O
interest O
and O
utility O
. O
My O
occupations O
at O
this O
age O
were O
principally O
the O
mathematics O
, O
and O
most O
of O
the O
branches O
of O
study O
appertaining O
to O
that O
science O
. O
I O
was O
busily O
employed O
in O
learning O
languages O
; O
Latin O
was O
already O
familiar O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
began O
to O
read O
some O
of O
the O
easiest O
Greek O
authors O
without O
the O
help O
of O
a O
lexicon O
. O
I O
also O
perfectly O
understood O
English O
and O
German O
. O
This O
is O
the O
list O
of O
my O
accomplishments O
at O
the O
age O
of O
seventeen O
; O
and O
you O
may O
conceive O
that O
my O
hours O
were O
fully O
employed O
in O
acquiring O
and O
maintaining O
a O
knowledge O
of O
this O
various O
literature O
. O
Another O
task O
also O
devolved O
upon O
me O
, O
when O
I O
became O
the O
instructor O
of O
my O
brothers O
. O
Ernest O
was O
six O
years O
younger O
than O
myself O
, O
and O
was O
my O
principal O
pupil O
. O
He O
had O
been O
afflicted O
with O
ill O
health O
from O
his O
infancy O
, O
through O
which O
Elizabeth O
and O
I O
had O
been O
his O
constant O
nurses O
: O
his O
disposition O
was O
gentle O
, O
but O
he O
was O
incapable O
of O
any O
severe O
application O
. O
William O
, O
the O
youngest O
of O
our O
family O
, O
was O
yet O
an O
infant O
, O
and O
the O
most O
beautiful O
little O
fellow O
in O
the O
world O
; O
his O
lively O
blue O
eyes O
, O
dimpled O
cheeks O
, O
and O
endearing O
manners O
, O
inspired O
the O
tenderest O
affection O
. O
Such O
was O
our O
domestic O
circle O
, O
from O
which O
care O
and O
pain O
seemed O
for O
ever O
banished O
. O
My O
father O
directed O
our O
studies O
, O
and O
my O
mother O
partook O
of O
our O
enjoyments O
. O
Neither O
of O
us O
possessed O
the O
slightest O
pre-eminence O
over O
the O
other O
; O
the O
voice O
of O
command O
was O
never O
heard O
amongst O
us O
; O
but O
mutual O
affection O
engaged O
us O
all O
to O
comply O
with O
and O
obey O
the O
slightest O
desire O
of O
each O
other O
. O
