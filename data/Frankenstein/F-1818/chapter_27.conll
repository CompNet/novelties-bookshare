MY O
present O
situation O
was O
one O
in O
which O
all O
voluntary O
thought O
was O
swallowed O
up O
and O
lost O
. O
I O
was O
hurried O
away O
by O
fury O
; O
revenge O
alone O
endowed O
me O
with O
strength O
and O
composure O
; O
it O
modelled O
my O
feelings O
, O
and O
allowed O
me O
to O
be O
calculating O
and O
calm O
, O
at O
periods O
when O
otherwise O
delirium O
or O
death O
would O
have O
been O
my O
portion O
. O
My O
first O
resolution O
was O
to O
quit O
Geneva O
for O
ever O
; O
my O
country O
, O
which O
, O
when O
I O
was O
happy O
and O
beloved O
, O
was O
dear O
to O
me O
, O
now O
, O
in O
my O
adversity O
, O
became O
hateful O
. O
I O
provided O
myself O
with O
a O
sum O
of O
money O
, O
together O
with O
a O
few O
jewels O
which O
had O
belonged O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
and O
departed O
. O
And O
now O
my O
wanderings O
began O
, O
which O
are O
to O
cease O
but O
with O
life O
. O
I O
have O
traversed O
a O
vast O
portion O
of O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
have O
endured O
all O
the O
hardships O
which O
travellers O
, O
in O
deserts O
and O
barbarous O
countries O
, O
are O
wont O
to O
meet O
. O
How O
I O
have O
lived O
I O
hardly O
know O
; O
many O
times O
have O
I O
stretched O
my O
failing O
limbs O
upon O
the O
sandy O
plain O
, O
and O
prayed O
for O
death O
. O
But O
revenge O
kept O
me O
alive O
; O
I O
dared O
not O
die O
, O
and O
leave O
my O
adversary O
in O
being O
. O
When O
I O
quitted O
Geneva O
, O
my O
first O
labour O
was O
to O
gain O
some O
clue O
by O
which O
I O
might O
trace O
the O
steps O
of O
my O
fiendish O
enemy O
. O
But O
my O
plan O
was O
unsettled O
; O
and O
I O
wandered O
many O
hours O
around O
the O
confines O
of O
the O
town O
, O
uncertain O
what O
path O
I O
should O
pursue O
. O
As O
night O
approached O
, O
I O
found O
myself O
at O
the O
entrance O
of O
the O
cemetery O
where O
William O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
my O
father O
, O
reposed O
. O
I O
entered O
it O
, O
and O
approached O
the O
tomb O
which O
marked O
their O
graves O
. O
Every O
thing O
was O
silent O
, O
except O
the O
leaves O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
which O
were O
gently O
agitated O
by O
the O
wind O
; O
the O
night O
was O
nearly O
dark O
; O
and O
the O
scene O
would O
have O
been O
solemn O
and O
affecting O
even O
to O
an O
uninterested O
observer O
. O
The O
spirits O
of O
the O
departed O
seemed O
to O
flit O
around O
, O
and O
to O
cast O
a O
shadow O
, O
which O
was O
felt O
but O
seen O
not O
, O
around O
the O
head O
of O
the O
mourner O
. O
The O
deep O
grief O
which O
this O
scene O
had O
at O
first O
excited O
quickly O
gave O
way O
to O
rage O
and O
despair O
. O
They O
were O
dead O
, O
and O
I O
lived O
; O
their O
murderer O
also O
lived O
, O
and O
to O
destroy O
him O
I O
must O
drag O
out O
my O
weary O
existence O
. O
I O
knelt O
on O
the O
grass O
, O
and O
kissed O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
with O
quivering O
lips O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
By O
the O
sacred O
earth O
on O
which O
I O
kneel O
, O
by O
the O
shades O
that O
wander O
near O
me O
, O
by O
the O
deep O
and O
eternal O
grief O
that O
I O
feel O
, O
I O
swear O
; O
and O
by O
thee O
, O
O O
Night O
, O
and O
by O
the O
spirits O
that O
preside O
over O
thee O
, O
I O
swear O
to O
pursue O
the O
dæmon O
, O
who O
caused O
this O
misery O
, O
until O
he O
or O
I O
shall O
perish O
in O
mortal O
conflict O
. O
For O
this O
purpose O
I O
will O
preserve O
my O
life O
: O
to O
execute O
this O
dear O
revenge O
, O
will O
I O
again O
behold O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
tread O
the O
green O
herbage O
of O
earth O
, O
which O
otherwise O
should O
vanish O
from O
my O
eyes O
for O
ever O
. O
And O
I O
call O
on O
you O
, O
spirits O
of O
the O
dead O
; O
and O
on O
you O
, O
wandering O
ministers O
of O
vengeance O
, O
to O
aid O
and O
conduct O
me O
in O
my O
work O
. O
Let O
the O
cursed O
and O
hellish O
monster O
drink O
deep O
of O
agony O
; O
let O
him O
feel O
the O
despair O
that O
now O
torments O
me O
. O
" O
I O
had O
begun O
my O
adjuration O
with O
solemnity O
, O
and O
an O
awe O
which O
almost O
assured O
me O
that O
the O
shades O
of O
my O
murdered O
friends O
heard O
and O
approved O
my O
devotion O
; O
but O
the O
furies O
possessed O
me O
as O
I O
concluded O
, O
and O
rage O
choaked O
my O
utterance O
. O
I O
was O
answered O
through O
the O
stillness O
of O
night O
by O
a O
loud O
and O
fiendish O
laugh O
. O
It O
rung O
on O
my O
ears O
long O
and O
heavily O
; O
the O
mountains O
re-echoed O
it O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
all O
hell O
surrounded O
me O
with O
mockery O
and O
laughter O
. O
Surely O
in O
that O
moment O
I O
should O
have O
been O
possessed O
by O
phrenzy O
, O
and O
have O
destroyed O
my O
miserable O
existence O
, O
but O
that O
my O
vow O
was O
heard O
, O
and O
that O
I O
was O
reserved O
for O
vengeance O
. O
The O
laughter O
died O
away O
; O
when O
a O
well-known O
and O
abhorred O
voice O
, O
apparently O
close O
to O
my O
ear O
, O
addressed O
me O
in O
an O
audible O
whisper— O
" O
I O
am O
satisfied O
: O
miserable O
wretch O
! O
you O
have O
determined O
to O
live O
, O
and O
I O
am O
satisfied O
. O
" O
I O
darted O
towards O
the O
spot O
from O
which O
the O
sound O
proceeded O
; O
but O
the O
devil O
eluded O
my O
grasp O
. O
Suddenly O
the O
broad O
disk O
of O
the O
moon O
arose O
, O
and O
shone O
full O
upon O
his O
ghastly O
and O
distorted O
shape O
, O
as O
he O
fled O
with O
more O
than O
mortal O
speed O
. O
I O
pursued O
him O
; O
and O
for O
many O
months O
this O
has O
been O
my O
task O
. O
Guided O
by O
a O
slight O
clue O
, O
I O
followed O
the O
windings O
of O
the O
Rhone O
, O
but O
vainly O
. O
The O
blue O
Mediterranean O
appeared O
; O
and O
, O
by O
a O
strange O
chance O
, O
I O
saw O
the O
fiend O
enter O
by O
night O
, O
and O
hide O
himself O
in O
a O
vessel O
bound O
for O
the O
Black O
Sea O
. O
I O
took O
my O
passage O
in O
the O
same O
ship O
; O
but O
he O
escaped O
, O
I O
know O
not O
how O
. O
Amidst O
the O
wilds O
of O
Tartary O
and O
Russia O
, O
although O
he O
still O
evaded O
me O
, O
I O
have O
ever O
followed O
in O
his O
track O
. O
Sometimes O
the O
peasants O
, O
scared O
by O
this O
horrid O
apparition O
, O
informed O
me O
of O
his O
path O
; O
sometimes O
he O
himself O
, O
who O
feared O
that O
if O
I O
lost O
all O
trace O
I O
should O
despair O
and O
die O
, O
often O
left O
some O
mark O
to O
guide O
me O
. O
The O
snows O
descended O
on O
my O
head O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
print O
of O
his O
huge O
step O
on O
the O
white O
plain O
. O
To O
you O
first O
entering O
on O
life O
, O
to O
whom O
care O
is O
new O
, O
and O
agony O
unknown O
, O
how O
can O
you O
understand O
what O
I O
have O
felt O
, O
and O
still O
feel O
? O
Cold O
, O
want O
, O
and O
fatigue O
, O
were O
the O
least O
pains O
which O
I O
was O
destined O
to O
endure O
; O
I O
was O
cursed O
by O
some O
devil O
, O
and O
carried O
about O
with O
me O
my O
eternal O
hell O
; O
yet O
still O
a O
spirit O
of O
good O
followed O
and O
directed O
my O
steps O
, O
and O
, O
when O
I O
most O
murmured O
, O
would O
suddenly O
extricate O
me O
from O
seemingly O
insurmountable O
difficulties O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
when O
nature O
, O
overcome O
by O
hunger O
, O
sunk O
under O
the O
exhaustion O
, O
a O
repast O
was O
prepared O
for O
me O
in O
the O
desert O
, O
that O
restored O
and O
inspirited O
me O
. O
The O
fare O
was O
indeed O
coarse O
, O
such O
as O
the O
peasants O
of O
the O
country O
ate O
; O
but O
I O
may O
not O
doubt O
that O
it O
was O
set O
there O
by O
the O
spirits O
that O
I O
had O
invoked O
to O
aid O
me O
. O
Often O
, O
when O
all O
was O
dry O
, O
the O
heavens O
cloudless O
, O
and O
I O
was O
parched O
by O
thirst O
, O
a O
slight O
cloud O
would O
bedim O
the O
sky O
, O
shed O
the O
few O
drops O
that O
revived O
me O
, O
and O
vanish O
. O
I O
followed O
, O
when O
I O
could O
, O
the O
courses O
of O
the O
rivers O
; O
but O
the O
dæmon O
generally O
avoided O
these O
, O
as O
it O
was O
here O
that O
the O
population O
of O
the O
country O
chiefly O
collected O
. O
In O
other O
places O
human O
beings O
were O
seldom O
seen O
; O
and O
I O
generally O
subsisted O
on O
the O
wild O
animals O
that O
crossed O
my O
path O
. O
I O
had O
money O
with O
me O
, O
and O
gained O
the O
friendship O
of O
the O
villagers O
by O
distributing O
it O
, O
or O
bringing O
with O
me O
some O
food O
that O
I O
had O
killed O
, O
which O
, O
after O
taking O
a O
small O
part O
, O
I O
always O
presented O
to O
those O
who O
had O
provided O
me O
with O
fire O
and O
utensils O
for O
cooking O
. O
My O
life O
, O
as O
it O
passed O
thus O
, O
was O
indeed O
hateful O
to O
me O
, O
and O
it O
was O
during O
sleep O
alone O
that O
I O
could O
taste O
joy O
. O
O O
blessed O
sleep O
! O
often O
, O
when O
most O
miserable O
, O
I O
sank O
to O
repose O
, O
and O
my O
dreams O
lulled O
me O
even O
to O
rapture O
. O
The O
spirits O
that O
guarded O
me O
had O
provided O
these O
moments O
, O
or O
rather O
hours O
, O
of O
happiness O
, O
that O
I O
might O
retain O
strength O
to O
fulfil O
my O
pilgrimage O
. O
Deprived O
of O
this O
respite O
, O
I O
should O
have O
sunk O
under O
my O
hardships O
. O
During O
the O
day O
I O
was O
sustained O
and O
inspirited O
by O
the O
hope O
of O
night O
: O
for O
in O
sleep O
I O
saw O
my O
friends O
, O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
my O
beloved O
country O
; O
again O
I O
saw O
the O
benevolent O
countenance O
of O
my O
father O
, O
heard O
the O
silver O
tones O
of O
my O
Elizabeth O
's O
voice O
, O
and O
beheld O
Clerval O
enjoying O
health O
and O
youth O
. O
Often O
, O
when O
wearied O
by O
a O
toilsome O
march O
, O
I O
persuaded O
myself O
that O
I O
was O
dreaming O
until O
night O
should O
come O
, O
and O
that O
I O
should O
then O
enjoy O
reality O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
my O
dearest O
friends O
. O
What O
agonizing O
fondness O
did O
I O
feel O
for O
them O
! O
how O
did O
I O
cling O
to O
their O
dear O
forms O
, O
as O
sometimes O
they O
haunted O
even O
my O
waking O
hours O
, O
and O
persuade O
myself O
that O
they O
still O
lived O
! O
At O
such O
moments O
vengeance O
, O
that O
burned O
within O
me O
, O
died O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
and O
I O
pursued O
my O
path O
towards O
the O
destruction O
of O
the O
dæmon O
, O
more O
as O
a O
task O
enjoined O
by O
heaven O
, O
as O
the O
mechanical O
impulse O
of O
some O
power O
of O
which O
I O
was O
unconscious O
, O
than O
as O
the O
ardent O
desire O
of O
my O
soul O
. O
What O
his O
feelings O
were O
whom O
I O
pursued O
, O
I O
can O
not O
know O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
indeed O
, O
he O
left O
marks O
in O
writing O
on O
the O
barks O
of O
the O
trees O
, O
or O
cut O
in O
stone O
, O
that O
guided O
me O
, O
and O
instigated O
my O
fury O
. O
" O
My O
reign O
is O
not O
yet O
over O
, O
" O
( O
these O
words O
were O
legible O
in O
one O
of O
these O
inscriptions O
) O
; O
" O
you O
live O
, O
and O
my O
power O
is O
complete O
. O
Follow O
me O
; O
I O
seek O
the O
everlasting O
ices O
of O
the O
north O
, O
where O
you O
will O
feel O
the O
misery O
of O
cold O
and O
frost O
, O
to O
which O
I O
am O
impassive O
. O
You O
will O
find O
near O
this O
place O
, O
if O
you O
follow O
not O
too O
tardily O
, O
a O
dead O
hare O
; O
eat O
, O
and O
be O
refreshed O
. O
Come O
on O
, O
my O
enemy O
; O
we O
have O
yet O
to O
wrestle O
for O
our O
lives O
; O
but O
many O
hard O
and O
miserable O
hours O
must O
you O
endure O
, O
until O
that O
period O
shall O
arrive O
. O
" O
Scoffing O
devil O
! O
Again O
do O
I O
vow O
vengeance O
; O
again O
do O
I O
devote O
thee O
, O
miserable O
fiend O
, O
to O
torture O
and O
death O
. O
Never O
will O
I O
omit O
my O
search O
, O
until O
he O
or O
I O
perish O
; O
and O
then O
with O
what O
ecstacy O
shall O
I O
join O
my O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
those O
who O
even O
now O
prepare O
for O
me O
the O
reward O
of O
my O
tedious O
toil O
and O
horrible O
pilgrimage O
. O
As O
I O
still O
pursued O
my O
journey O
to O
the O
northward O
, O
the O
snows O
thickened O
, O
and O
the O
cold O
increased O
in O
a O
degree O
almost O
too O
severe O
to O
support O
. O
The O
peasants O
were O
shut O
up O
in O
their O
hovels O
, O
and O
only O
a O
few O
of O
the O
most O
hardy O
ventured O
forth O
to O
seize O
the O
animals O
whom O
starvation O
had O
forced O
from O
their O
hiding-places O
to O
seek O
for O
prey O
. O
The O
rivers O
were O
covered O
with O
ice O
, O
and O
no O
fish O
could O
be O
procured O
; O
and O
thus O
I O
was O
cut O
off O
from O
my O
chief O
article O
of O
maintenance O
. O
The O
triumph O
of O
my O
enemy O
increased O
with O
the O
difficulty O
of O
my O
labours O
. O
One O
inscription O
that O
he O
left O
was O
in O
these O
words O
: O
" O
Prepare O
! O
your O
toils O
only O
begin O
: O
wrap O
yourself O
in O
furs O
, O
and O
provide O
food O
, O
for O
we O
shall O
soon O
enter O
upon O
a O
journey O
where O
your O
sufferings O
will O
satisfy O
my O
everlasting O
hatred O
. O
" O
My O
courage O
and O
perseverance O
were O
invigorated O
by O
these O
scoffing O
words O
; O
I O
resolved O
not O
to O
fail O
in O
my O
purpose O
; O
and O
, O
calling O
on O
heaven O
to O
support O
me O
, O
I O
continued O
with O
unabated O
fervour O
to O
traverse O
immense O
deserts O
, O
until O
the O
ocean O
appeared O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
and O
formed O
the O
utmost O
boundary O
of O
the O
horizon O
. O
Oh O
! O
how O
unlike O
it O
was O
to O
the O
blue O
seas O
of O
the O
south O
! O
Covered O
with O
ice O
, O
it O
was O
only O
to O
be O
distinguished O
from O
land O
by O
its O
superior O
wildness O
and O
ruggedness O
. O
The O
Greeks O
wept O
for O
joy O
when O
they O
beheld O
the O
Mediterranean O
from O
the O
hills O
of O
Asia O
, O
and O
hailed O
with O
rapture O
the O
boundary O
of O
their O
toils O
. O
I O
did O
not O
weep O
; O
but O
I O
knelt O
down O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
full O
heart O
, O
thanked O
my O
guiding O
spirit O
for O
conducting O
me O
in O
safety O
to O
the O
place O
where O
I O
hoped O
, O
notwithstanding O
my O
adversary O
's O
gibe O
, O
to O
meet O
and O
grapple O
with O
him O
. O
Some O
weeks O
before O
this O
period O
I O
had O
procured O
a O
sledge O
and O
dogs O
, O
and O
thus O
traversed O
the O
snows O
with O
inconceivable O
speed O
. O
I O
know O
not O
whether O
the O
fiend O
possessed O
the O
same O
advantages O
; O
but O
I O
found O
that O
, O
as O
before O
I O
had O
daily O
lost O
ground O
in O
the O
pursuit O
, O
I O
now O
gained O
on O
him O
; O
so O
much O
so O
, O
that O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
the O
ocean O
, O
he O
was O
but O
one O
day O
's O
journey O
in O
advance O
, O
and O
I O
hoped O
to O
intercept O
him O
before O
he O
should O
reach O
the O
beach O
. O
With O
new O
courage O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
pressed O
on O
, O
and O
in O
two O
days O
arrived O
at O
a O
wretched O
hamlet O
on O
the O
sea-shore O
. O
I O
inquired O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
concerning O
the O
fiend O
, O
and O
gained O
accurate O
information O
. O
A O
gigantic O
monster O
, O
they O
said O
, O
had O
arrived O
the O
night O
before O
, O
armed O
with O
a O
gun O
and O
many O
pistols O
; O
putting O
to O
flight O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
a O
solitary O
cottage O
, O
through O
fear O
of O
his O
terrific O
appearance O
. O
He O
had O
carried O
off O
their O
store O
of O
winter O
food O
, O
and O
, O
placing O
it O
in O
a O
sledge O
, O
to O
draw O
which O
he O
had O
seized O
on O
a O
numerous O
drove O
of O
trained O
dogs O
, O
he O
had O
harnessed O
them O
, O
and O
the O
same O
night O
, O
to O
the O
joy O
of O
the O
horror-struck O
villagers O
, O
had O
pursued O
his O
journey O
across O
the O
sea O
in O
a O
direction O
that O
led O
to O
no O
land O
; O
and O
they O
conjectured O
that O
he O
must O
speedily O
be O
destroyed O
by O
the O
breaking O
of O
the O
ice O
, O
or O
frozen O
by O
the O
eternal O
frosts O
. O
On O
hearing O
this O
information O
, O
I O
suffered O
a O
temporary O
access O
of O
despair O
. O
He O
had O
escaped O
me O
; O
and O
I O
must O
commence O
a O
destructive O
and O
almost O
endless O
journey O
across O
the O
mountainous O
ices O
of O
the O
ocean O
, O
—amidst O
cold O
that O
few O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
could O
long O
endure O
, O
and O
which O
I O
, O
the O
native O
of O
a O
genial O
and O
sunny O
climate O
, O
could O
not O
hope O
to O
survive O
. O
Yet O
at O
the O
idea O
that O
the O
fiend O
should O
live O
and O
be O
triumphant O
, O
my O
rage O
and O
vengeance O
returned O
, O
and O
, O
like O
a O
mighty O
tide O
, O
overwhelmed O
every O
other O
feeling O
. O
After O
a O
slight O
repose O
, O
during O
which O
the O
spirits O
of O
the O
dead O
hovered O
round O
, O
and O
instigated O
me O
to O
toil O
and O
revenge O
, O
I O
prepared O
for O
my O
journey O
. O
I O
exchanged O
my O
land O
sledge O
for O
one O
fashioned O
for O
the O
inequalities O
of O
the O
frozen O
ocean O
; O
and O
, O
purchasing O
a O
plentiful O
stock O
of O
provisions O
, O
I O
departed O
from O
land O
. O
I O
can O
not O
guess O
how O
many O
days O
have O
passed O
since O
then O
; O
but O
I O
have O
endured O
misery O
, O
which O
nothing O
but O
the O
eternal O
sentiment O
of O
a O
just O
retribution O
burning O
within O
my O
heart O
could O
have O
enabled O
me O
to O
support O
. O
Immense O
and O
rugged O
mountains O
of O
ice O
often O
barred O
up O
my O
passage O
, O
and O
I O
often O
heard O
the O
thunder O
of O
the O
ground O
sea O
, O
which O
threatened O
my O
destruction O
. O
But O
again O
the O
frost O
came O
, O
and O
made O
the O
paths O
of O
the O
sea O
secure O
. O
By O
the O
quantity O
of O
provision O
which O
I O
had O
consumed O
I O
should O
guess O
that O
I O
had O
passed O
three O
weeks O
in O
this O
journey O
; O
and O
the O
continual O
protraction O
of O
hope O
, O
returning O
back O
upon O
the O
heart O
, O
often O
wrung O
bitter O
drops O
of O
despondency O
and O
grief O
from O
my O
eyes O
. O
Despair O
had O
indeed O
almost O
secured O
her O
prey O
, O
and O
I O
should O
soon O
have O
sunk O
beneath O
this O
misery O
; O
when O
once O
, O
after O
the O
poor O
animals O
that O
carried O
me O
had O
with O
incredible O
toil O
gained O
the O
summit O
of O
a O
sloping O
ice O
mountain O
, O
and O
one O
sinking O
under O
his O
fatigue O
died O
, O
I O
viewed O
the O
expanse O
before O
me O
with O
anguish O
, O
when O
suddenly O
my O
eye O
caught O
a O
dark O
speck O
upon O
the O
dusky O
plain O
. O
I O
strained O
my O
sight O
to O
discover O
what O
it O
could O
be O
, O
and O
uttered O
a O
wild O
cry O
of O
ecstacy O
when O
I O
distinguished O
a O
sledge O
, O
and O
the O
distorted O
proportions O
of O
a O
well-known O
form O
within O
. O
Oh O
! O
with O
what O
a O
burning O
gush O
did O
hope O
revisit O
my O
heart O
! O
warm O
tears O
filled O
my O
eyes O
, O
which O
I O
hastily O
wiped O
away O
, O
that O
they O
might O
not O
intercept O
the O
view O
I O
had O
of O
the O
dæmon O
; O
but O
still O
my O
sight O
was O
dimmed O
by O
the O
burning O
drops O
, O
until O
, O
giving O
way O
to O
the O
emotions O
that O
oppressed O
me O
, O
I O
wept O
aloud O
. O
But O
this O
was O
not O
the O
time O
for O
delay O
; O
I O
disencumbered O
the O
dogs O
of O
their O
dead O
companion O
, O
gave O
them O
a O
plentiful O
portion O
of O
food O
; O
and O
, O
after O
an O
hour O
's O
rest O
, O
which O
was O
absolutely O
necessary O
, O
and O
yet O
which O
was O
bitterly O
irksome O
to O
me O
, O
I O
continued O
my O
route O
. O
The O
sledge O
was O
still O
visible O
; O
nor O
did O
I O
again O
lose O
sight O
of O
it O
, O
except O
at O
the O
moments O
when O
for O
a O
short O
time O
some O
ice O
rock O
concealed O
it O
with O
its O
intervening O
crags O
. O
I O
indeed O
perceptibly O
gained O
on O
it O
; O
and O
when O
, O
after O
nearly O
two O
days O
' O
journey O
, O
I O
beheld O
my O
enemy O
at O
no O
more O
than O
a O
mile O
distant O
, O
my O
heart O
bounded O
within O
me O
. O
But O
now O
, O
when O
I O
appeared O
almost O
within O
grasp O
of O
my O
enemy O
, O
my O
hopes O
were O
suddenly O
extinguished O
, O
and O
I O
lost O
all O
trace O
of O
him O
more O
utterly O
than O
I O
had O
ever O
done O
before O
. O
A O
ground O
sea O
was O
heard O
; O
the O
thunder O
of O
its O
progress O
, O
as O
the O
waters O
rolled O
and O
swelled O
beneath O
me O
, O
became O
every O
moment O
more O
ominous O
and O
terrific O
. O
I O
pressed O
on O
, O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
The O
wind O
arose O
; O
the O
sea O
roared O
; O
and O
, O
as O
with O
the O
mighty O
shock O
of O
an O
earthquake O
, O
it O
split O
, O
and O
cracked O
with O
a O
tremendous O
and O
overwhelming O
sound O
. O
The O
work O
was O
soon O
finished O
: O
in O
a O
few O
minutes O
a O
tumultuous O
sea O
rolled O
between O
me O
and O
my O
enemy O
, O
and O
I O
was O
left O
drifting O
on O
a O
scattered O
piece O
of O
ice O
, O
that O
was O
continually O
lessening O
, O
and O
thus O
preparing O
for O
me O
a O
hideous O
death O
. O
In O
this O
manner O
many O
appalling O
hours O
passed O
; O
several O
of O
my O
dogs O
died O
; O
and O
I O
myself O
was O
about O
to O
sink O
under O
the O
accumulation O
of O
distress O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
your O
vessel O
riding O
at O
anchor O
, O
and O
holding O
forth O
to O
me O
hopes O
of O
succour O
and O
life O
. O
I O
had O
no O
conception O
that O
vessels O
ever O
came O
so O
far O
north O
, O
and O
was O
astounded O
at O
the O
sight O
. O
I O
quickly O
destroyed O
part O
of O
my O
sledge O
to O
construct O
oars O
; O
and O
by O
these O
means O
was O
enabled O
, O
with O
infinite O
fatigue O
, O
to O
move O
my O
ice-raft O
in O
the O
direction O
of O
your O
ship O
. O
I O
had O
determined O
, O
if O
you O
were O
going O
southward O
, O
still O
to O
trust O
myself O
to O
the O
mercy O
of O
the O
seas O
, O
rather O
than O
abandon O
my O
purpose O
. O
I O
hoped O
to O
induce O
you O
to O
grant O
me O
a O
boat O
with O
which O
I O
could O
pursue O
my O
enemy O
. O
But O
your O
direction O
was O
northward O
. O
You O
took O
me O
on O
board O
when O
my O
vigour O
was O
exhausted O
, O
and O
I O
should O
soon O
have O
sunk O
under O
my O
multiplied O
hardships O
into O
a O
death O
, O
which O
I O
still O
dread O
, O
—for O
my O
task O
is O
unfulfilled O
. O
Oh O
! O
when O
will O
my O
guiding O
spirit O
, O
in O
conducting O
me O
to O
the O
dæmon O
, O
allow O
me O
the O
rest O
I O
so O
much O
desire O
; O
or O
must O
I O
die O
, O
and O
he O
yet O
live O
? O
If O
I O
do O
, O
swear O
to O
me O
, O
Walton O
, O
that O
he O
shall O
not O
escape O
; O
that O
you O
will O
seek O
him O
, O
and O
satisfy O
my O
vengeance O
in O
his O
death O
. O
Yet O
, O
do O
I O
dare O
ask O
you O
to O
undertake O
my O
pilgrimage O
, O
to O
endure O
the O
hardships O
that O
I O
have O
undergone O
? O
No O
; O
I O
am O
not O
so O
selfish O
. O
Yet O
, O
when O
I O
am O
dead O
, O
if O
he O
should O
appear O
; O
if O
the O
ministers O
of O
vengeance O
should O
conduct O
him O
to O
you O
, O
swear O
that O
he O
shall O
not O
live—swear O
that O
he O
shall O
not O
triumph O
over O
my O
accumulated O
woes O
, O
and O
live O
to O
make O
another O
such O
a O
wretch O
as O
I O
am O
. O
He O
is O
eloquent O
and O
persuasive O
; O
and O
once O
his O
words O
had O
even O
power O
over O
my O
heart O
: O
but O
trust O
him O
not O
. O
His O
soul O
is O
as O
hellish O
as O
his O
form O
, O
full O
of O
treachery O
and O
fiend-like O
malice O
. O
Hear O
him O
not O
; O
call O
on O
the O
manes O
of O
William O
, O
Justine O
, O
Clerval O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
my O
father O
, O
and O
of O
the O
wretched O
Victor O
, O
and O
thrust O
your O
sword O
into O
his O
heart O
. O
I O
will O
hover O
near O
, O
and O
direct O
the O
steel O
aright O

YOU O
have O
read O
this O
strange O
and O
terrific O
story O
, O
Margaret O
; O
and O
do O
you O
not O
feel O
your O
blood O
congealed O
with O
horror O
, O
like O
that O
which O
even O
now O
curdles O
mine O
? O
Sometimes O
, O
seized O
with O
sudden O
agony O
, O
he O
could O
not O
continue O
his O
tale O
; O
at O
others O
, O
his O
voice O
broken O
, O
yet O
piercing O
, O
uttered O
with O
difficulty O
the O
words O
so O
replete O
with O
agony O
. O
His O
fine O
and O
lovely O
eyes O
were O
now O
lighted O
up O
with O
indignation O
, O
now O
subdued O
to O
downcast O
sorrow O
, O
and O
quenched O
in O
infinite O
wretchedness O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
commanded O
his O
countenance O
and O
tones O
, O
and O
related O
the O
most O
horrible O
incidents O
with O
a O
tranquil O
voice O
, O
suppressing O
every O
mark O
of O
agitation O
; O
then O
, O
like O
a O
volcano O
bursting O
forth O
, O
his O
face O
would O
suddenly O
change O
to O
an O
expression O
of O
the O
wildest O
rage O
, O
as O
he O
shrieked O
out O
imprecations O
on O
his O
persecutor O
. O
His O
tale O
is O
connected O
, O
and O
told O
with O
an O
appearance O
of O
the O
simplest O
truth O
; O
yet O
I O
own O
to O
you O
that O
the O
letters O
of O
Felix O
and O
Safie O
, O
which O
he O
shewed O
me O
, O
and O
the O
apparition O
of O
the O
monster O
, O
seen O
from O
our O
ship O
, O
brought O
to O
me O
a O
greater O
conviction O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
his O
narrative O
than O
his O
asseverations O
, O
however O
earnest O
and O
connected O
. O
Such O
a O
monster O
has O
then O
really O
existence O
; O
I O
can O
not O
doubt O
it O
; O
yet O
I O
am O
lost O
in O
surprise O
and O
admiration O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
endeavoured O
to O
gain O
from O
Frankenstein O
the O
particulars O
of O
his O
creature O
's O
formation O
; O
but O
on O
this O
point O
he O
was O
impenetrable O
. O
" O
Are O
you O
mad O
, O
my O
friend O
? O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
or O
whither O
does O
your O
senseless O
curiosity O
lead O
you O
? O
Would O
you O
also O
create O
for O
yourself O
and O
the O
world O
a O
demoniacal O
enemy O
? O
Or O
to O
what O
do O
your O
questions O
tend O
? O
Peace O
, O
peace O
! O
learn O
my O
miseries O
, O
and O
do O
not O
seek O
to O
increase O
your O
own O
. O
" O
Frankenstein O
discovered O
that O
I O
made O
notes O
concerning O
his O
history O
: O
he O
asked O
to O
see O
them O
, O
and O
then O
himself O
corrected O
and O
augmented O
them O
in O
many O
places O
; O
but O
principally O
in O
giving O
the O
life O
and O
spirit O
to O
the O
conversations O
he O
held O
with O
his O
enemy O
. O
" O
Since O
you O
have O
preserved O
my O
narration O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
I O
would O
not O
that O
a O
mutilated O
one O
should O
go O
down O
to O
posterity O
. O
" O
Thus O
has O
a O
week O
passed O
away O
, O
while O
I O
have O
listened O
to O
the O
strangest O
tale O
that O
ever O
imagination O
formed O
. O
My O
thoughts O
, O
and O
every O
feeling O
of O
my O
soul O
, O
have O
been O
drunk O
up O
by O
the O
interest O
for O
my O
guest O
, O
which O
this O
tale O
, O
and O
his O
own O
elevated O
and O
gentle O
manners O
have O
created O
. O
I O
wish O
to O
soothe O
him O
; O
yet O
can O
I O
counsel O
one O
so O
infinitely O
miserable O
, O
so O
destitute O
of O
every O
hope O
of O
consolation O
, O
to O
live O
? O
Oh O
, O
no O
! O
the O
only O
joy O
that O
he O
can O
now O
know O
will O
be O
when O
he O
composes O
his O
shattered O
feelings O
to O
peace O
and O
death O
. O
Yet O
he O
enjoys O
one O
comfort O
, O
the O
offspring O
of O
solitude O
and O
delirium O
: O
he O
believes O
, O
that O
, O
when O
in O
dreams O
he O
holds O
converse O
with O
his O
friends O
, O
and O
derives O
from O
that O
communion O
consolation O
for O
his O
miseries O
, O
or O
excitements O
to O
his O
vengeance O
, O
that O
they O
are O
not O
the O
creations O
of O
his O
fancy O
, O
but O
the O
real O
beings O
who O
visit O
him O
from O
the O
regions O
of O
a O
remote O
world O
. O
This O
faith O
gives O
a O
solemnity O
to O
his O
reveries O
that O
render O
them O
to O
me O
almost O
as O
imposing O
and O
interesting O
as O
truth O
. O
Our O
conversations O
are O
not O
always O
confined O
to O
his O
own O
history O
and O
misfortunes O
. O
On O
every O
point O
of O
general O
literature O
he O
displays O
unbounded O
knowledge O
, O
and O
a O
quick O
and O
piercing O
apprehension O
. O
His O
eloquence O
is O
forcible O
and O
touching O
; O
nor O
can O
I O
hear O
him O
, O
when O
he O
relates O
a O
pathetic O
incident O
, O
or O
endeavours O
to O
move O
the O
passions O
of O
pity O
or O
love O
, O
without O
tears O
. O
What O
a O
glorious O
creature O
must O
he O
have O
been O
in O
the O
days O
of O
his O
prosperity O
, O
when O
he O
is O
thus O
noble O
and O
godlike O
in O
ruin O
. O
He O
seems O
to O
feel O
his O
own O
worth O
, O
and O
the O
greatness O
of O
his O
fall O
. O
" O
When O
younger O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
were O
destined O
for O
some O
great O
enterprise O
. O
My O
feelings O
are O
profound O
; O
but O
I O
possessed O
a O
coolness O
of O
judgment O
that O
fitted O
me O
for O
illustrious O
achievements O
. O
This O
sentiment O
of O
the O
worth O
of O
my O
nature O
supported O
me O
, O
when O
others O
would O
have O
been O
oppressed O
; O
for O
I O
deemed O
it O
criminal O
to O
throw O
away O
in O
useless O
grief O
those O
talents O
that O
might O
be O
useful O
to O
my O
fellow-creatures O
. O
When O
I O
reflected O
on O
the O
work O
I O
had O
completed O
, O
no O
less O
a O
one O
than O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
sensitive O
and O
rational O
animal O
, O
I O
could O
not O
rank O
myself O
with O
the O
herd O
of O
common O
projectors O
. O
But O
this O
feeling O
, O
which O
supported O
me O
in O
the O
commencement O
of O
my O
career O
, O
now O
serves O
only O
to O
plunge O
me O
lower O
in O
the O
dust O
. O
All O
my O
speculations O
and O
hopes O
are O
as O
nothing O
; O
and O
, O
like O
the O
archangel O
who O
aspired O
to O
omnipotence O
, O
I O
am O
chained O
in O
an O
eternal O
hell O
. O
My O
imagination O
was O
vivid O
, O
yet O
my O
powers O
of O
analysis O
and O
application O
were O
intense O
; O
by O
the O
union O
of O
these O
qualities O
I O
conceived O
the O
idea O
, O
and O
executed O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
man O
. O
Even O
now O
I O
can O
not O
recollect O
, O
without O
passion O
, O
my O
reveries O
while O
the O
work O
was O
incomplete O
. O
I O
trod O
heaven O
in O
my O
thoughts O
, O
now O
exulting O
in O
my O
powers O
, O
now O
burning O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
their O
effects O
. O
From O
my O
infancy O
I O
was O
imbued O
with O
high O
hopes O
and O
a O
lofty O
ambition O
; O
but O
how O
am O
I O
sunk O
! O
Oh O
! O
my O
friend O
, O
if O
you O
had O
known O
me O
as O
I O
once O
was O
, O
you O
would O
not O
recognize O
me O
in O
this O
state O
of O
degradation O
. O
Despondency O
rarely O
visited O
my O
heart O
; O
a O
high O
destiny O
seemed O
to O
bear O
me O
on O
, O
until O
I O
fell O
, O
never O
, O
never O
again O
to O
rise O
. O
" O
Must O
I O
then O
lose O
this O
admirable O
being O
? O
I O
have O
longed O
for O
a O
friend O
; O
I O
have O
sought O
one O
who O
would O
sympathize O
with O
and O
love O
me O
. O
Behold O
, O
on O
these O
desert O
seas O
I O
have O
found O
such O
a O
one O
; O
but O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
I O
have O
gained O
him O
only O
to O
know O
his O
value O
, O
and O
lose O
him O
. O
I O
would O
reconcile O
him O
to O
life O
, O
but O
he O
repulses O
the O
idea O
. O
" O
I O
thank O
you O
, O
Walton O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
for O
your O
kind O
intentions O
towards O
so O
miserable O
a O
wretch O
; O
but O
when O
you O
speak O
of O
new O
ties O
, O
and O
fresh O
affections O
, O
think O
you O
that O
any O
can O
replace O
those O
who O
are O
gone O
? O
Can O
any O
man O
be O
to O
me O
as O
Clerval O
was O
; O
or O
any O
woman O
another O
Elizabeth O
? O
Even O
where O
the O
affections O
are O
not O
strongly O
moved O
by O
any O
superior O
excellence O
, O
the O
companions O
of O
our O
childhood O
always O
possess O
a O
certain O
power O
over O
our O
minds O
, O
which O
hardly O
any O
later O
friend O
can O
obtain O
. O
They O
know O
our O
infantine O
dispositions O
, O
which O
, O
however O
they O
may O
be O
afterwards O
modified O
, O
are O
never O
eradicated O
; O
and O
they O
can O
judge O
of O
our O
actions O
with O
more O
certain O
conclusions O
as O
to O
the O
integrity O
of O
our O
motives O
. O
A O
sister O
or O
a O
brother O
can O
never O
, O
unless O
indeed O
such O
symptoms O
have O
been O
shewn O
early O
, O
suspect O
the O
other O
of O
fraud O
or O
false O
dealing O
, O
when O
another O
friend O
, O
however O
strongly O
he O
may O
be O
attached O
, O
may O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
himself O
, O
be O
invaded O
with O
suspicion O
. O
But O
I O
enjoyed O
friends O
, O
dear O
not O
only O
through O
habit O
and O
association O
, O
but O
from O
their O
own O
merits O
; O
and O
, O
wherever O
I O
am O
, O
the O
soothing O
voice O
of O
my O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
the O
conversation O
of O
Clerval O
, O
will O
be O
ever O
whispered O
in O
my O
ear O
. O
They O
are O
dead O
; O
and O
but O
one O
feeling O
in O
such O
a O
solitude O
can O
persuade O
me O
to O
preserve O
my O
life O
. O
If O
I O
were O
engaged O
in O
any O
high O
undertaking O
or O
design O
, O
fraught O
with O
extensive O
utility O
to O
my O
fellow-creatures O
, O
then O
could O
I O
live O
to O
fulfil O
it O
. O
But O
such O
is O
not O
my O
destiny O
; O
I O
must O
pursue O
and O
destroy O
the O
being O
to O
whom O
I O
gave O
existence O
; O
then O
my O
lot O
on O
earth O
will O
be O
fulfilled O
, O
and O
I O
may O
die O

MY O
BELOVED O
SISTER O
, O
I O
write O
to O
you O
, O
encompassed O
by O
peril O
, O
and O
ignorant O
whether O
I O

ever O
doomed O
to O
see O
again O
dear O
England O
, O
and O
the O
dearer O
friends O
that O

I O
am O
surrounded O
by O
mountains O
of O
ice O
, O
which O
admit O
of O
no O
escape O
, O
and O
threaten O
every O
moment O
to O
crush O
my O
vessel O

The O
brave O
fellows O

whom O
I O
have O
persuaded O
to O
be O
my O
companions O
, O
look O
towards O
me O
for O
aid O
; O
but O
I O
have O
none O
to O
bestow O
. O
There O
is O
something O
terribly O
appalling O
in O
our O
situation O
, O
yet O
my O
courage O
and O
hopes O
do O
not O
desert O
me O
. O
We O
may O
survive O
; O
and O
if O
we O
do O
not O

I O
will O
repeat O
the O
lessons O
of O
my O
Seneca O

and O
die O
with O
a O
good O
heart O

Yet O
what O
, O
Margaret O

will O
be O
the O
state O
of O
your O
mind O
? O
You O
will O
not O
hear O
of O
my O
destruction O

and O
you O
will O
anxiously O
await O
my O
return O

Years O
will O
pass O
, O
and O
you O
will O
have O
visitings O
of O
despair O

and O
yet O
be O
tortured O
by O
hope O

Oh O
! O
my O
beloved O
sister O
, O
the O
sickening O
failings O
of O
your O
heart-felt O
expectations O
are O
, O
in O
prospect O

more O
terrible O
to O
me O
than O
my O

death O

But O
you O
have O
a O
husband O

lovely O
children O

you O
may O
be O
happy O

heaven O
bless O

and O
make O
you O
so O

My O
unfortunate O
guest O
regards O
me O
with O
the O
tenderest O
compassion O
. O
He O
endeavours O
to O
fill O
me O
with O
hope O
; O
and O
talks O
as O
if O
life O
were O
a O
possession O
which O
he O
valued O
. O
He O
reminds O
me O
how O
often O
the O
same O
accidents O
have O
happened O
to O
other O
navigators O
, O
who O
have O
attempted O
this O
sea O
, O
and O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
myself O
, O
he O
fills O
me O
with O
cheerful O
auguries O
. O
Even O
the O
sailors O
feel O
the O
power O
of O
his O
eloquence O
: O
when O
he O
speaks O
, O
they O
no O
longer O
despair O
; O
he O
rouses O
their O
energies O
, O
and O
, O
while O
they O
hear O
his O
voice O
, O
they O
believe O
these O
vast O
mountains O
of O
ice O
are O
mole-hills O
, O
which O
will O
vanish O
before O
the O
resolutions O
of O
man O

These O
feelings O
are O
transitory O
; O
each O
day O
's O
expectation O
delayed O
fills O
them O
with O
fear O

I O
almost O
dread O
a O

this O

September O
5th O
. O
A O
scene O
has O
just O
passed O
of O
such O
uncommon O
interest O
, O
that O
although O
it O
is O
highly O
probable O
that O
these O
papers O
may O
never O
reach O
you O
, O
yet O
I O
can O
not O
forbear O
recording O
it O
. O
We O
are O
still O
surrounded O
by O
mountains O
of O
ice O
, O
still O
in O
imminent O
danger O
of O
being O
crushed O
in O
their O
conflict O
. O
The O
cold O
is O
excessive O
, O
and O
many O
of O
my O
unfortunate O
comrades O
have O
already O
found O
a O
grave O
amidst O
this O
scene O
of O
desolation O
. O
Frankenstein O
has O
daily O
declined O
in O
health O
: O
a O
feverish O
fire O
still O
glimmers O
in O
his O
eyes O
; O
but O
he O
is O
exhausted O
, O
and O
, O
when O
suddenly O
roused O
to O
any O
exertion O
, O
he O
speedily O
sinks O
again O
into O
apparent O
lifelessness O
. O
I O
mentioned O
in O
my O
last O
letter O
the O
fears O
I O
entertained O
of O
a O
mutiny O
. O
This O
morning O
, O
as O
I O
sat O
watching O
the O
wan O
countenance O
of O
my O
friend—his O
eyes O
half O
closed O
, O
and O
his O
limbs O
hanging O
listlessly O
, O
—I O
was O
roused O
by O
half O
a O
dozen O
of O
the O
sailors O
, O
who O
desired O
admission O
into O
the O
cabin O
. O
They O
entered O
; O
and O
their O
leader O
addressed O
me O
. O
He O
told O
me O
that O
he O
and O
his O
companions O
had O
been O
chosen O
by O
the O
other O
sailors O
to O
come O
in O
deputation O
to O
me O
, O
to O
make O
me O
a O
demand O
, O
which O
, O
in O
justice O
, O
I O
could O
not O
refuse O
. O
We O
were O
immured O
in O
ice O
, O
and O
should O
probably O
never O
escape O
; O
but O
they O
feared O
that O
if O
, O
as O
was O
possible O
, O
the O
ice O
should O
dissipate O
, O
and O
a O
free O
passage O
be O
opened O
, O
I O
should O
be O
rash O
enough O
to O
continue O
my O
voyage O
, O
and O
lead O
them O
into O
fresh O
dangers O
, O
after O
they O
might O
happily O
have O
surmounted O
this O
. O
They O
desired O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
I O
should O
engage O
with O
a O
solemn O
promise O
, O
that O
if O
the O
vessel O
should O
be O
freed O
, O
I O
would O
instantly O
direct O
my O
course O
southward O
. O
This O
speech O
troubled O
me O
. O
I O
had O
not O
despaired O
; O
nor O
had O
I O
yet O
conceived O
the O
idea O
of O
returning O
, O
if O
set O
free O
. O
Yet O
could O
I O
, O
in O
justice O
, O
or O
even O
in O
possibility O
, O
refuse O
this O
demand O
? O
I O
hesitated O
before O
I O
answered O
; O
when O
Frankenstein O
, O
who O
had O
at O
first O
been O
silent O
, O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
appeared O
hardly O
to O
have O
force O
enough O
to O
attend O
, O
now O
roused O
himself O
; O
his O
eyes O
sparkled O
, O
and O
his O
cheeks O
flushed O
with O
momentary O
vigour O
. O
Turning O
towards O
the O
men O
, O
he O
said— O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O
What O
do O
you O
demand O
of O
your O
captain O
? O
Are O
you O
then O
so O
easily O
turned O
from O
your O
design O
? O
Did O
you O
not O
call O
this O
a O
glorious O
expedition O
? O
and O
wherefore O
was O
it O
glorious O
? O
Not O
because O
the O
way O
was O
smooth O
and O
placid O
as O
a O
southern O
sea O
, O
but O
because O
it O
was O
full O
of O
dangers O
and O
terror O
; O
because O
, O
at O
every O
new O
incident O
, O
your O
fortitude O
was O
to O
be O
called O
forth O
, O
and O
your O
courage O
exhibited O
; O
because O
danger O
and O
death O
surrounded O
, O
and O
these O
dangers O
you O
were O
to O
brave O
and O
overcome O
. O
For O
this O
was O
it O
a O
glorious O
, O
for O
this O
was O
it O
an O
honourable O
undertaking O
. O
You O
were O
hereafter O
to O
be O
hailed O
as O
the O
benefactors O
of O
your O
species O
; O
your O
name O
adored O
, O
as O
belonging O
to O
brave O
men O
who O
encountered O
death O
for O
honour O
and O
the O
benefit O
of O
mankind O
. O
And O
now O
, O
behold O
, O
with O
the O
first O
imagination O
of O
danger O
, O
or O
, O
if O
you O
will O
, O
the O
first O
mighty O
and O
terrific O
trial O
of O
your O
courage O
, O
you O
shrink O
away O
, O
and O
are O
content O
to O
be O
handed O
down O
as O
men O
who O
had O
not O
strength O
enough O
to O
endure O
cold O
and O
peril O
; O
and O
so O
, O
poor O
souls O
, O
they O
were O
chilly O
, O
and O
returned O
to O
their O
warm O
fire-sides O
. O
Why O
, O
that O
requires O
not O
this O
preparation O
; O
ye O
need O
not O
have O
come O
thus O
far O
, O
and O
dragged O
your O
captain O
to O
the O
shame O
of O
a O
defeat O
, O
merely O
to O
prove O
yourselves O
cowards O
. O
Oh O
! O
be O
men O
, O
or O
be O
more O
than O
men O
. O
Be O
steady O
to O
your O
purposes O
, O
and O
firm O
as O
a O
rock O
. O
This O
ice O
is O
not O
made O
of O
such O
stuff O
as O
your O
hearts O
might O
be O
; O
it O
is O
mutable O
, O
can O
not O
withstand O
you O
, O
if O
you O
say O
that O
it O
shall O
not O
. O
Do O
not O
return O
to O
your O
families O
with O
the O
stigma O
of O
disgrace O
marked O
on O
your O
brows O
. O
Return O
as O
heroes O
who O
have O
fought O
and O
conquered O
, O
and O
who O
know O
not O
what O
it O
is O
to O
turn O
their O
backs O
on O
the O
foe O
. O
" O
He O
spoke O
this O
with O
a O
voice O
so O
modulated O
to O
the O
different O
feelings O
expressed O
in O
his O
speech O
, O
with O
an O
eye O
so O
full O
of O
lofty O
design O
and O
heroism O
, O
that O
can O
you O
wonder O
that O
these O
men O
were O
moved O
. O
They O
looked O
at O
one O
another O
, O
and O
were O
unable O
to O
reply O
. O
I O
spoke O
; O
I O
told O
them O
to O
retire O
, O
and O
consider O
of O
what O
had O
been O
said O
: O
that O
I O
would O
not O
lead O
them O
further O
north O
, O
if O
they O
strenuously O
desired O
the O
contrary O
; O
but O
that O
I O
hoped O
that O
, O
with O
reflection O
, O
their O
courage O
would O
return O
. O
They O
retired O
, O
and O
I O
turned O
towards O
my O
friend O
; O
but O
he O
was O
sunk O
in O
languor O
, O
and O
almost O
deprived O
of O
life O
. O
How O
all O
this O
will O
terminate O
, O
I O
know O
not O
; O
but O
I O
had O
rather O
die O
, O
than O
return O
shamefully O
, O
—my O
purpose O
unfulfilled O
. O
Yet O
I O
fear O
such O
will O
be O
my O
fate O
; O
the O
men O
, O
unsupported O
by O
ideas O
of O
glory O
and O
honour O
, O
can O
never O
willingly O
continue O
to O
endure O
their O
present O
hardships O
. O
September O
7th O
. O
The O
die O
is O
cast O
; O
I O
have O
consented O
to O
return O
, O
if O
we O
are O
not O
destroyed O
. O
Thus O
are O
my O
hopes O
blasted O
by O
cowardice O
and O
indecision O
; O
I O
come O
back O
ignorant O
and O
disappointed O
. O
It O
requires O
more O
philosophy O
than O
I O
possess O
, O
to O
bear O
this O
injustice O
with O
patience O
. O
September O
12th O
. O
It O
is O
past O
; O
I O
am O
returning O
to O
England O
. O
I O
have O
lost O
my O
hopes O
of O
utility O
and O
glory O
; O
—I O
have O
lost O
my O
friend O
. O
But O
I O
will O
endeavour O
to O
detail O
these O
bitter O
circumstances O
to O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
; O
and O
, O
while O
I O
am O
wafted O
towards O
England O
, O
and O
towards O
you O
, O
I O
will O
not O
despond O
. O
September O
19th O
, O
the O
ice O
began O
to O
move O
, O
and O
roarings O
like O
thunder O
were O
heard O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
as O
the O
islands O
split O
and O
cracked O
in O
every O
direction O
. O
We O
were O
in O
the O
most O
imminent O
peril O
; O
but O
, O
as O
we O
could O
only O
remain O
passive O
, O
my O
chief O
attention O
was O
occupied O
by O
my O
unfortunate O
guest O
, O
whose O
illness O
increased O
in O
such O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
he O
was O
entirely O
confined O
to O
his O
bed O
. O
The O
ice O
cracked O
behind O
us O
, O
and O
was O
driven O
with O
force O
towards O
the O
north O
; O
a O
breeze O
sprung O
from O
the O
west O
, O
and O
on O
the O
11th O
the O
passage O
towards O
the O
south O
became O
perfectly O
free O
. O
When O
the O
sailors O
saw O
this O
, O
and O
that O
their O
return O
to O
their O
native O
country O
was O
apparently O
assured O
, O
a O
shout O
of O
tumultuous O
joy O
broke O
from O
them O
, O
loud O
and O
long-continued O
. O
Frankenstein O
, O
who O
was O
dozing O
, O
awoke O
, O
and O
asked O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
tumult O
. O
" O
They O
shout O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
because O
they O
will O
soon O
return O
to O
England O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
then O
really O
return O
? O
" O
" O
Alas O
! O
yes O
; O
I O
can O
not O
withstand O
their O
demands O
. O
I O
can O
not O
lead O
them O
unwillingly O
to O
danger O
, O
and O
I O
must O
return O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
so O
, O
if O
you O
will O
; O
but O
I O
will O
not O
. O
You O
may O
give O
up O
your O
purpose O
; O
but O
mine O
is O
assigned O
to O
me O
by O
heaven O
, O
and O
I O
dare O
not O
. O
I O
am O
weak O
; O
but O
surely O
the O
spirits O
who O
assist O
my O
vengeance O
will O
endow O
me O
with O
sufficient O
strength O
. O
" O
Saying O
this O
, O
he O
endeavoured O
to O
spring O
from O
the O
bed O
, O
but O
the O
exertion O
was O
too O
great O
for O
him O
; O
he O
fell O
back O
, O
and O
fainted O
. O
It O
was O
long O
before O
he O
was O
restored O
; O
and O
I O
often O
thought O
that O
life O
was O
entirely O
extinct O
. O
At O
length O
he O
opened O
his O
eyes O
, O
but O
he O
breathed O
with O
difficulty O
, O
and O
was O
unable O
to O
speak O
. O
The O
surgeon O
gave O
him O
a O
composing O
draught O
, O
and O
ordered O
us O
to O
leave O
him O
undisturbed O
. O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
he O
told O
me O
, O
that O
my O
friend O
had O
certainly O
not O
many O
hours O
to O
live O
. O
His O
sentence O
was O
pronounced O
; O
and O
I O
could O
only O
grieve O
, O
and O
be O
patient O
. O
I O
sat O
by O
his O
bed O
watching O
him O
; O
his O
eyes O
were O
closed O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
he O
slept O
; O
but O
presently O
he O
called O
to O
me O
in O
a O
feeble O
voice O
, O
and O
, O
bidding O
me O
come O
near O
, O
said— O
" O
Alas O
! O
the O
strength O
I O
relied O
on O
is O
gone O
; O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
shall O
soon O
die O
, O
and O
he O
, O
my O
enemy O
and O
persecutor O
, O
may O
still O
be O
in O
being O
. O
Think O
not O
, O
Walton O
, O
that O
in O
the O
last O
moments O
of O
my O
existence O
I O
feel O
that O
burning O
hatred O
, O
and O
ardent O
desire O
of O
revenge O
, O
I O
once O
expressed O
; O
but O
I O
feel O
myself O
justified O
in O
desiring O
the O
death O
of O
my O
adversary O
. O
During O
these O
last O
days O
I O
have O
been O
occupied O
in O
examining O
my O
past O
conduct O
; O
nor O
do O
I O
find O
it O
blameable O
. O
In O
a O
fit O
of O
enthusiastic O
madness O
I O
created O
a O
rational O
creature O
, O
and O
was O
bound O
towards O
him O
, O
to O
assure O
, O
as O
far O
as O
was O
in O
my O
power O
, O
his O
happiness O
and O
well-being O
. O
This O
was O
my O
duty O
; O
but O
there O
was O
another O
still O
paramount O
to O
that O
. O
My O
duties O
towards O
my O
fellow-creatures O
had O
greater O
claims O
to O
my O
attention O
, O
because O
they O
included O
a O
greater O
proportion O
of O
happiness O
or O
misery O
. O
Urged O
by O
this O
view O
, O
I O
refused O
, O
and O
I O
did O
right O
in O
refusing O
, O
to O
create O
a O
companion O
for O
the O
first O
creature O
. O
He O
showed O
unparalleled O
malignity O
and O
selfishness O
, O
in O
evil O
: O
he O
destroyed O
my O
friends O
; O
he O
devoted O
to O
destruction O
beings O
who O
possessed O
exquisite O
sensations O
, O
happiness O
, O
and O
wisdom O
; O
nor O
do O
I O
know O
where O
this O
thirst O
for O
vengeance O
may O
end O
. O
Miserable O
himself O
, O
that O
he O
may O
render O
no O
other O
wretched O
, O
he O
ought O
to O
die O
. O
The O
task O
of O
his O
destruction O
was O
mine O
, O
but O
I O
have O
failed O
. O
When O
actuated O
by O
selfish O
and O
vicious O
motives O
, O
I O
asked O
you O
to O
undertake O
my O
unfinished O
work O
; O
and O
I O
renew O
this O
request O
now O
, O
when O
I O
am O
only O
induced O
by O
reason O
and O
virtue O
. O
" O
Yet O
I O
can O
not O
ask O
you O
to O
renounce O
your O
country O
and O
friends O
, O
to O
fulfil O
this O
task O
; O
and O
now O
, O
that O
you O
are O
returning O
to O
England O
, O
you O
will O
have O
little O
chance O
of O
meeting O
with O
him O
. O
But O
the O
consideration O
of O
these O
points O
, O
and O
the O
well-balancing O
of O
what O
you O
may O
esteem O
your O
duties O
, O
I O
leave O
to O
you O
; O
my O
judgment O
and O
ideas O
are O
already O
disturbed O
by O
the O
near O
approach O
of O
death O
. O
I O
dare O
not O
ask O
you O
to O
do O
what O
I O
think O
right O
, O
for O
I O
may O
still O
be O
misled O
by O
passion O
. O
" O
That O
he O
should O
live O
to O
be O
an O
instrument O
of O
mischief O
disturbs O
me O
; O
in O
other O
respects O
this O
hour O
, O
when O
I O
momentarily O
expect O
my O
release O
, O
is O
the O
only O
happy O
one O
which O
I O
have O
enjoyed O
for O
several O
years O
. O
The O
forms O
of O
the O
beloved O
dead O
flit O
before O
me O
, O
and O
I O
hasten O
to O
their O
arms O
. O
Farewell O
, O
Walton O
! O
Seek O
happiness O
in O
tranquillity O
, O
and O
avoid O
ambition O
, O
even O
if O
it O
be O
only O
the O
apparently O
innocent O
one O
of O
distinguishing O
yourself O
in O
science O
and O
discoveries O
. O
Yet O
why O
do O
I O
say O
this O
? O
I O
have O
myself O
been O
blasted O
in O
these O
hopes O
, O
yet O
another O
may O
succeed O
. O
" O
His O
voice O
became O
fainter O
as O
he O
spoke O
; O
and O
at O
length O
, O
exhausted O
by O
his O
effort O
, O
he O
sunk O
into O
silence O
. O
About O
half O
an O
hour O
afterwards O
he O
attempted O
again O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
was O
unable O
; O
he O
pressed O
my O
hand O
feebly O
, O
and O
his O
eyes O
closed O
for O
ever O
, O
while O
the O
irradiation O
of O
a O
gentle O
smile O
passed O
away O
from O
his O
lips O
. O
Margaret O
, O
what O
comment O
can O
I O
make O
on O
the O
untimely O
extinction O
of O
this O
glorious O
spirit O
? O
What O
can O
I O
say O
, O
that O
will O
enable O
you O
to O
understand O
the O
depth O
of O
my O
sorrow O
? O
All O
that O
I O
should O
express O
would O
be O
inadequate O
and O
feeble O
. O
My O
tears O
flow O
; O
my O
mind O
is O
overshadowed O
by O
a O
cloud O
of O
disappointment O
. O
But O
I O
journey O
towards O
England O
, O
and O
I O
may O
there O
find O
consolation O
. O
I O
am O
interrupted O
. O
What O
do O
these O
sounds O
portend O
? O
It O
is O
midnight O
; O
the O
breeze O
blows O
fairly O
, O
and O
the O
watch O
on O
deck O
scarcely O
stir O
. O
Again O
; O
there O
is O
a O
sound O
as O
of O
a O
human O
voice O
, O
but O
hoarser O
; O
it O
comes O
from O
the O
cabin O
where O
the O
remains O
of O
Frankenstein O
still O
lie O
. O
I O
must O
arise O
, O
and O
examine O
. O
Good O
night O
, O
my O
sister O
. O
Great O
God O
! O
what O
a O
scene O
has O
just O
taken O
place O
! O
I O
am O
yet O
dizzy O
with O
the O
remembrance O
of O
it O
. O
I O
hardly O
know O
whether O
I O
shall O
have O
the O
power O
to O
detail O
it O
; O
yet O
the O
tale O
which O
I O
have O
recorded O
would O
be O
incomplete O
without O
this O
final O
and O
wonderful O
catastrophe O
. O
I O
entered O
the O
cabin O
, O
where O
lay O
the O
remains O
of O
my O
ill-fated O
and O
admirable O
friend O
. O
Over O
him O
hung O
a O
form O
which O
I O
can O
not O
find O
words O
to O
describe O
; O
gigantic O
in O
stature O
, O
yet O
uncouth O
and O
distorted O
in O
its O
proportions O
. O
As O
he O
hung O
over O
the O
coffin O
, O
his O
face O
was O
concealed O
by O
long O
locks O
of O
ragged O
hair O
; O
but O
one O
vast O
hand O
was O
extended O
, O
in O
colour O
and O
apparent O
texture O
like O
that O
of O
a O
mummy O
. O
When O
he O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
my O
approach O
, O
he O
ceased O
to O
utter O
exclamations O
of O
grief O
and O
horror O
, O
and O
sprung O
towards O
the O
window O
. O
Never O
did O
I O
behold O
a O
vision O
so O
horrible O
as O
his O
face O
, O
of O
such O
loathsome O
, O
yet O
appalling O
hideousness O
. O
I O
shut O
my O
eyes O
involuntarily O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
recollect O
what O
were O
my O
duties O
with O
regard O
to O
this O
destroyer O
. O
I O
called O
on O
him O
to O
stay O
. O
He O
paused O
, O
looking O
on O
me O
with O
wonder O
; O
and O
, O
again O
turning O
towards O
the O
lifeless O
form O
of O
his O
creator O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
forget O
my O
presence O
, O
and O
every O
feature O
and O
gesture O
seemed O
instigated O
by O
the O
wildest O
rage O
of O
some O
uncontrollable O
passion O
. O
" O
That O
is O
also O
my O
victim O
! O
" O
he O
exclaimed O
; O
" O
in O
his O
murder O
my O
crimes O
are O
consummated O
; O
the O
miserable O
series O
of O
my O
being O
is O
wound O
to O
its O
close O
! O
Oh O
, O
Frankenstein O
! O
generous O
and O
self-devoted O
being O
! O
what O
does O
it O
avail O
that O
I O
now O
ask O
thee O
to O
pardon O
me O
? O
I O
, O
who O
irretrievably O
destroyed O
thee O
by O
destroying O
all O
thou O
lovedst O
. O
Alas O
! O
he O
is O
cold O
; O
he O
may O
not O
answer O
me O
. O
" O
His O
voice O
seemed O
suffocated O
; O
and O
my O
first O
impulses O
, O
which O
had O
suggested O
to O
me O
the O
duty O
of O
obeying O
the O
dying O
request O
of O
my O
friend O
, O
in O
destroying O
his O
enemy O
, O
were O
now O
suspended O
by O
a O
mixture O
of O
curiosity O
and O
compassion O
. O
I O
approached O
this O
tremendous O
being O
; O
I O
dared O
not O
again O
raise O
my O
looks O
upon O
his O
face O
, O
there O
was O
something O
so O
scaring O
and O
unearthly O
in O
his O
ugliness O
. O
I O
attempted O
to O
speak O
, O
but O
the O
words O
died O
away O
on O
my O
lips O
. O
The O
monster O
continued O
to O
utter O
wild O
and O
incoherent O
self-reproaches O
. O
At O
length O
I O
gathered O
resolution O
to O
address O
him O
, O
in O
a O
pause O
of O
the O
tempest O
of O
his O
passion O
: O
" O
Your O
repentance O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
is O
now O
superfluous O
. O
If O
you O
had O
listened O
to O
the O
voice O
of O
conscience O
, O
and O
heeded O
the O
stings O
of O
remorse O
, O
before O
you O
had O
urged O
your O
diabolical O
vengeance O
to O
this O
extremity O
, O
Frankenstein O
would O
yet O
have O
lived O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
dream O
? O
" O
said O
the O
dæmon O
; O
" O
do O
you O
think O
that O
I O
was O
then O
dead O
to O
agony O
and O
remorse O
? O
—He O
, O
" O
he O
continued O
, O
pointing O
to O
the O
corpse O
, O
" O
he O
suffered O
not O
more O
in O
the O
consummation O
of O
the O
deed O
; O
—oh O
! O
not O
the O
ten-thousandth O
portion O
of O
the O
anguish O
that O
was O
mine O
during O
the O
lingering O
detail O
of O
its O
execution O
. O
A O
frightful O
selfishness O
hurried O
me O
on O
, O
while O
my O
heart O
was O
poisoned O
with O
remorse O
. O
Think O
ye O
that O
the O
groans O
of O
Clerval O
were O
music O
to O
my O
ears O
? O
My O
heart O
was O
fashioned O
to O
be O
susceptible O
of O
love O
and O
sympathy O
; O
and O
, O
when O
wrenched O
by O
misery O
to O
vice O
and O
hatred O
, O
it O
did O
not O
endure O
the O
violence O
of O
the O
change O
without O
torture O
such O
as O
you O
can O
not O
even O
imagine O
. O
" O
After O
the O
murder O
of O
Clerval O
, O
I O
returned O
to O
Switzerland O
, O
heartbroken O
and O
overcome O
. O
I O
pitied O
Frankenstein O
; O
my O
pity O
amounted O
to O
horror O
: O
I O
abhorred O
myself O
. O
But O
when O
I O
discovered O
that O
he O
, O
the O
author O
at O
once O
of O
my O
existence O
and O
of O
its O
unspeakable O
torments O
, O
dared O
to O
hope O
for O
happiness O
; O
that O
while O
he O
accumulated O
wretchedness O
and O
despair O
upon O
me O
, O
he O
sought O
his O
own O
enjoyment O
in O
feelings O
and O
passions O
from O
the O
indulgence O
of O
which O
I O
was O
for O
ever O
barred O
, O
then O
impotent O
envy O
and O
bitter O
indignation O
filled O
me O
with O
an O
insatiable O
thirst O
for O
vengeance O
. O
I O
recollected O
my O
threat O
, O
and O
resolved O
that O
it O
should O
be O
accomplished O
. O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
was O
preparing O
for O
myself O
a O
deadly O
torture O
; O
but O
I O
was O
the O
slave O
, O
not O
the O
master O
of O
an O
impulse O
, O
which O
I O
detested O
, O
yet O
could O
not O
disobey O
. O
Yet O
when O
she O
died O
! O
—nay O
, O
then O
I O
was O
not O
miserable O
. O
I O
had O
cast O
off O
all O
feeling O
, O
subdued O
all O
anguish O
to O
riot O
in O
the O
excess O
of O
my O
despair O
. O
Evil O
thenceforth O
became O
my O
good O
. O
Urged O
thus O
far O
, O
I O
had O
no O
choice O
but O
to O
adapt O
my O
nature O
to O
an O
element O
which O
I O
had O
willingly O
chosen O
. O
The O
completion O
of O
my O
demoniacal O
design O
became O
an O
insatiable O
passion O
. O
And O
now O
it O
is O
ended O
; O
there O
is O
my O
last O
victim O
! O
" O
I O
was O
at O
first O
touched O
by O
the O
expressions O
of O
his O
misery O
; O
yet O
, O
when O
I O
called O
to O
mind O
what O
Frankenstein O
had O
said O
of O
his O
powers O
of O
eloquence O
and O
persuasion O
, O
and O
when O
I O
again O
cast O
my O
eyes O
on O
the O
lifeless O
form O
of O
my O
friend O
, O
indignation O
was O
re-kindled O
within O
me O
. O
" O
Wretch O
! O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
it O
is O
well O
that O
you O
come O
here O
to O
whine O
over O
the O
desolation O
that O
you O
have O
made O
. O
You O
throw O
a O
torch O
into O
a O
pile O
of O
buildings O
; O
and O
when O
they O
are O
consumed O
you O
sit O
among O
the O
ruins O
, O
and O
lament O
the O
fall O
. O
Hypocritical O
fiend O
! O
if O
he O
whom O
you O
mourn O
still O
lived O
, O
still O
would O
he O
be O
the O
object O
, O
again O
would O
he O
become O
the O
prey O
of O
your O
accursed O
vengeance O
. O
It O
is O
not O
pity O
that O
you O
feel O
; O
you O
lament O
only O
because O
the O
victim O
of O
your O
malignity O
is O
withdrawn O
from O
your O
power O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
it O
is O
not O
thus—not O
thus O
, O
" O
interrupted O
the O
being O
; O
" O
yet O
such O
must O
be O
the O
impression O
conveyed O
to O
you O
by O
what O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
purport O
of O
my O
actions O
. O
Yet O
I O
seek O
not O
a O
fellow-feeling O
in O
my O
misery O
. O
No O
sympathy O
may O
I O
ever O
find O
. O
When O
I O
first O
sought O
it O
, O
it O
was O
the O
love O
of O
virtue O
, O
the O
feelings O
of O
happiness O
and O
affection O
with O
which O
my O
whole O
being O
overflowed O
, O
that O
I O
wished O
to O
be O
participated O
. O
But O
now O
, O
that O
virtue O
has O
become O
to O
me O
a O
shadow O
, O
and O
that O
happiness O
and O
affection O
are O
turned O
into O
bitter O
and O
loathing O
despair O
, O
in O
what O
should O
I O
seek O
for O
sympathy O
? O
I O
am O
content O
to O
suffer O
alone O
, O
while O
my O
sufferings O
shall O
endure O
: O
when O
I O
die O
, O
I O
am O
well O
satisfied O
that O
abhorrence O
and O
opprobrium O
should O
load O
my O
memory O
. O
Once O
my O
fancy O
was O
soothed O
with O
dreams O
of O
virtue O
, O
of O
fame O
, O
and O
of O
enjoyment O
. O
Once O
I O
falsely O
hoped O
to O
meet O
with O
beings O
, O
who O
, O
pardoning O
my O
outward O
form O
, O
would O
love O
me O
for O
the O
excellent O
qualities O
which O
I O
was O
capable O
of O
bringing O
forth O
. O
I O
was O
nourished O
with O
high O
thoughts O
of O
honour O
and O
devotion O
. O
But O
now O
vice O
has O
degraded O
me O
beneath O
the O
meanest O
animal O
. O
No O
crime O
, O
no O
mischief O
, O
no O
malignity O
, O
no O
misery O
, O
can O
be O
found O
comparable O
to O
mine O
. O
When O
I O
call O
over O
the O
frightful O
catalogue O
of O
my O
deeds O
, O
I O
can O
not O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
he O
whose O
thoughts O
were O
once O
filled O
with O
sublime O
and O
transcendent O
visions O
of O
the O
beauty O
and O
the O
majesty O
of O
goodness O
. O
But O
it O
is O
even O
so O
; O
the O
fallen O
angel O
becomes O
a O
malignant O
devil O
. O
Yet O
even O
that O
enemy O
of O
God O
and O
man O
had O
friends O
and O
associates O
in O
his O
desolation O
; O
I O
am O
quite O
alone O
. O
" O
You O
, O
who O
call O
Frankenstein O
your O
friend O
, O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
knowledge O
of O
my O
crimes O
and O
his O
misfortunes O
. O
But O
, O
in O
the O
detail O
which O
he O
gave O
you O
of O
them O
, O
he O
could O
not O
sum O
up O
the O
hours O
and O
months O
of O
misery O
which O
I O
endured O
, O
wasting O
in O
impotent O
passions O
. O
For O
whilst O
I O
destroyed O
his O
hopes O
, O
I O
did O
not O
satisfy O
my O
own O
desires O
. O
They O
were O
for O
ever O
ardent O
and O
craving O
; O
still O
I O
desired O
love O
and O
fellowship O
, O
and O
I O
was O
still O
spurned O
. O
Was O
there O
no O
injustice O
in O
this O
? O
Am O
I O
to O
be O
thought O
the O
only O
criminal O
, O
when O
all O
human O
kind O
sinned O
against O
me O
? O
Why O
do O
you O
not O
hate O
Felix O
, O
who O
drove O
his O
friend O
from O
his O
door O
with O
contumely O
? O
Why O
do O
you O
not O
execrate O
the O
rustic O
who O
sought O
to O
destroy O
the O
saviour O
of O
his O
child O
? O
Nay O
, O
these O
are O
virtuous O
and O
immaculate O
beings O
! O
I O
, O
the O
miserable O
and O
the O
abandoned O
, O
am O
an O
abortion O
, O
to O
be O
spurned O
at O
, O
and O
kicked O
, O
and O
trampled O
on O
. O
Even O
now O
my O
blood O
boils O
at O
the O
recollection O
of O
this O
injustice O
. O
" O
But O
it O
is O
true O
that O
I O
am O
a O
wretch O
. O
I O
have O
murdered O
the O
lovely O
and O
the O
helpless O
; O
I O
have O
strangled O
the O
innocent O
as O
they O
slept O
, O
and O
grasped O
to O
death O
his O
throat O
who O
never O
injured O
me O
or O
any O
other O
living O
thing O
. O
I O
have O
devoted O
my O
creator O
, O
the O
select O
specimen O
of O
all O
that O
is O
worthy O
of O
love O
and O
admiration O
among O
men O
, O
to O
misery O
; O
I O
have O
pursued O
him O
even O
to O
that O
irremediable O
ruin O
. O
There O
he O
lies O
, O
white O
and O
cold O
in O
death O
. O
You O
hate O
me O
; O
but O
your O
abhorrence O
can O
not O
equal O
that O
with O
which O
I O
regard O
myself O
. O
I O
look O
on O
the O
hands O
which O
executed O
the O
deed O
; O
I O
think O
on O
the O
heart O
in O
which O
the O
imagination O
of O
it O
was O
conceived O
, O
and O
long O
for O
the O
moment O
when O
they O
will O
meet O
my O
eyes O
, O
when O
it O
will O
haunt O
my O
thoughts O
, O
no O
more O
. O
" O
Fear O
not O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
the O
instrument O
of O
future O
mischief O
. O
My O
work O
is O
nearly O
complete O
. O
Neither O
your O
's O
nor O
any O
man O
's O
death O
is O
needed O
to O
consummate O
the O
series O
of O
my O
being O
, O
and O
accomplish O
that O
which O
must O
be O
done O
; O
but O
it O
requires O
my O
own O
. O
Do O
not O
think O
that O
I O
shall O
be O
slow O
to O
perform O
this O
sacrifice O
. O
I O
shall O
quit O
your O
vessel O
on O
the O
ice-raft O
which O
brought O
me O
hither O
, O
and O
shall O
seek O
the O
most O
northern O
extremity O
of O
the O
globe O
; O
I O
shall O
collect O
my O
funeral O
pile O
, O
and O
consume O
to O
ashes O
this O
miserable O
frame O
, O
that O
its O
remains O
may O
afford O
no O
light O
to O
any O
curious O
and O
unhallowed O
wretch O
, O
who O
would O
create O
such O
another O
as O
I O
have O
been O
. O
I O
shall O
die O

I O
shall O
no O
longer O
feel O
the O
agonies O
which O
now O
consume O
me O
, O

be O
the O
prey O
of O
feelings O
unsatisfied O

yet O
unquenched O

He O
is O
dead O
who O
called O
me O
into O
being O
; O

when O
I O
shall O
be O
no O
more O
, O
the O
very O
remembrance O
of O
us O
both O
will O
speedily O
vanish O

I O
shall O
no O
longer O
see O
the O
sun O

the O
winds O
play O
on O
my O
cheeks O

Light O
, O
feeling O
, O

sense O
, O
will O
pass O
away O
; O
and O
in O
this O
condition O
must O
I O
find O
my O
happiness O
. O
Some O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
the O
images O
which O
this O
world O
affords O
first O
opened O
upon O
me O
, O
when O
I O
felt O
the O
cheering O
warmth O
of O
summer O
, O
and O
heard O
the O
rustling O
of O
the O
leaves O
and O
the O
chirping O
of O
the O
birds O
, O
and O
these O
were O
all O
to O
me O
, O
I O
should O
have O
wept O
to O
die O
; O
now O
it O
is O
my O
only O
consolation O
. O
Polluted O
by O
crimes O
, O
and O
torn O
by O
the O
bitterest O
remorse O
, O
where O
can O
I O
find O
rest O
but O
in O
death O
? O
" O
Farewell O
! O
I O
leave O
you O
, O
and O
in O
you O
the O
last O
of O
human O
kind O
whom O
these O
eyes O
will O
ever O
behold O
. O
Farewell O
, O
Frankenstein O
! O
If O
thou O
wert O
yet O
alive O
, O
and O
yet O
cherished O
a O
desire O
of O
revenge O
against O
me O
, O
it O
would O
be O
better O
satiated O
in O
my O
life O
than O
in O
my O
destruction O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
so O
; O
thou O
didst O
seek O
my O
extinction O
, O
that O
I O
might O
not O
cause O
greater O
wretchedness O
; O
and O
if O
yet O
, O
in O
some O
mode O
unknown O
to O
me O
, O
thou O
hast O
not O
yet O
ceased O
to O
think O
and O
feel O
, O
thou O
desirest O
not O
my O
life O
for O
my O
own O
misery O
. O
Blasted O
as O
thou O
wert O
, O
my O
agony O
was O
still O
superior O
to O
thine O
; O
for O
the O
bitter O
sting O
of O
remorse O
may O
not O
cease O
to O
rankle O
in O
my O
wounds O
until O
death O
shall O
close O
them O
for O
ever O
. O
" O
But O
soon O
, O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
with O
sad O
and O
solemn O
enthusiasm O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
die O
, O
and O
what O
I O
now O
feel O
be O
no O
longer O
felt O
. O
Soon O
these O
burning O
miseries O
will O
be O
extinct O
. O
I O
shall O
ascend O
my O
funeral O
pile O
triumphantly O
, O
and O
exult O
in O
the O
agony O
of O
the O
torturing O
flames O
. O
The O
light O
of O
that O
conflagration O
will O
fade O
away O
; O
my O
ashes O
will O
be O
swept O
into O
the O
sea O
by O
the O
winds O
. O
My O
spirit O
will O
sleep O
in O
peace O
; O
or O
if O
it O
thinks O
, O
it O
will O
not O
surely O
think O
thus O
. O
Farewell O
. O
" O
He O
sprung O
from O
the O
cabin-window O
, O
as O
he O
said O
this O
, O
upon O
the O
ice-raft O
which O
lay O
close O
to O
the O
vessel O

He O
was O
soon O
borne O
away O
by O
the O
waves O
