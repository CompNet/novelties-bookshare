SAVILLE O

Archangel O

28th O
March O

17— O
. O
How O
slowly O
the O
time O
passes O
here O
, O
encompassed O
as O
I O
am O
by O
frost O
and O
snow O
; O
yet O
a O
second O
step O
is O
taken O
towards O
my O
enterprise O
. O
I O
have O
hired O
a O
vessel O
, O
and O
am O
occupied O
in O
collecting O
my O
sailors O
; O
those O
whom O
I O
have O
already O
engaged O
appear O
to O
be O
men O
on O
whom O
I O
can O
depend O
, O
and O
are O
certainly O
possessed O
of O
dauntless O
courage O
. O
But O
I O
have O
one O
want O
which O
I O
have O
never O
yet O
been O
able O
to O
satisfy O
; O
and O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
object O
of O
which O
I O
now O
feel O
as O
a O
most O
severe O
evil O
. O
I O
have O
no O
friend O
, O
Margaret O
: O
when O
I O
am O
glowing O
with O
the O
enthusiasm O
of O
success O
, O
there O
will O
be O
none O
to O
participate O
my O
joy O
; O
if O
I O
am O
assailed O
by O
disappointment O
, O
no O
one O
will O
endeavour O
to O
sustain O
me O
in O
dejection O
. O
I O
shall O
commit O
my O
thoughts O
to O
paper O
, O
it O
is O
true O
; O
but O
that O
is O
a O
poor O
medium O
for O
the O
communication O
of O
feeling O
. O
I O
desire O
the O
company O
of O
a O
man O
who O
could O
sympathize O
with O
me O
; O
whose O
eyes O
would O
reply O
to O
mine O
. O
You O
may O
deem O
me O
romantic O
, O
my O
dear O
sister O
, O
but O
I O
bitterly O
feel O
the O
want O
of O
a O
friend O
. O
I O
have O
no O
one O
near O
me O
, O
gentle O
yet O
courageous O
, O
possessed O
of O
a O
cultivated O
as O
well O
as O
of O
a O
capacious O
mind O
, O
whose O
tastes O
are O
like O
my O
own O
, O
to O
approve O
or O
amend O
my O
plans O
. O
How O
would O
such O
a O
friend O
repair O
the O
faults O
of O
your O
poor O
brother O
! O
I O
am O
too O
ardent O
in O
execution O
, O
and O
too O
impatient O
of O
difficulties O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
still O
greater O
evil O
to O
me O
that O
I O
am O
self-educated O
: O
for O
the O
first O
fourteen O
years O
of O
my O
life O
I O
ran O
wild O
on O
a O
common O
, O
and O
read O
nothing O
but O
our O
uncle O
Thomas O
's O
books O
of O
voyages O
. O
At O
that O
age O
I O
became O
acquainted O
with O
the O
celebrated O
poets O
of O
our O
own O
country O
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
when O
it O
had O
ceased O
to O
be O
in O
my O
power O
to O
derive O
its O
most O
important O
benefits O
from O
such O
a O
conviction O
, O
that O
I O
perceived O
the O
necessity O
of O
becoming O
acquainted O
with O
more O
languages O
than O
that O
of O
my O
native O
country O
. O
Now O
I O
am O
twenty-eight O
, O
and O
am O
in O
reality O
more O
illiterate O
than O
many O
school-boys O
of O
fifteen O
. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
I O
have O
thought O
more O
, O
and O
that O
my O
day O
dreams O
are O
more O
extended O
and O
magnificent O
; O
but O
they O
want O
( O
as O
the O
painters O
call O
it O
) O
keeping O
; O
and O
I O
greatly O
need O
a O
friend O
who O
would O
have O
sense O
enough O
not O
to O
despise O
me O
as O
romantic O
, O
and O
affection O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
endeavour O
to O
regulate O
my O
mind O
. O
Well O
, O
these O
are O
useless O
complaints O
; O
I O
shall O
certainly O
find O
no O
friend O
on O
the O
wide O
ocean O
, O
nor O
even O
here O
in O
Archangel O
, O
among O
merchants O
and O
seamen O
. O
Yet O
some O
feelings O
, O
unallied O
to O
the O
dross O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
beat O
even O
in O
these O
rugged O
bosoms O
. O
My O
lieutenant O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
is O
a O
man O
of O
wonderful O
courage O
and O
enterprise O
; O
he O
is O
madly O
desirous O
of O
glory O
. O
He O
is O
an O
Englishman O
, O
and O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
national O
and O
professional O
prejudices O
, O
unsoftened O
by O
cultivation O
, O
retains O
some O
of O
the O
noblest O
endowments O
of O
humanity O
. O
I O
first O
became O
acquainted O
with O
him O
on O
board O
a O
whale O
vessel O
: O
finding O
that O
he O
was O
unemployed O
in O
this O
city O
, O
I O
easily O
engaged O
him O
to O
assist O
in O
my O
enterprise O
. O
The O
master O
is O
a O
person O
of O
an O
excellent O
disposition O
, O
and O
is O
remarkable O
in O
the O
ship O
for O
his O
gentleness O
, O
and O
the O
mildness O
of O
his O
discipline O
. O
He O
is O
, O
indeed O
, O
of O
so O
amiable O
a O
nature O
, O
that O
he O
will O
not O
hunt O
( O
a O
favourite O
, O
and O
almost O
the O
only O
amusement O
here O
) O
, O
because O
he O
can O
not O
endure O
to O
spill O
blood O
. O
He O
is O
, O
moreover O
, O
heroically O
generous O
. O
Some O
years O
ago O
he O
loved O
a O
young O
Russian O
lady O
, O
of O
moderate O
fortune O
; O
and O
having O
amassed O
a O
considerable O
sum O
in O
prize-money O
, O
the O
father O
of O
the O
girl O
consented O
to O
the O
match O
. O
He O
saw O
his O
mistress O
once O
before O
the O
destined O
ceremony O
; O
but O
she O
was O
bathed O
in O
tears O
, O
and O
, O
throwing O
herself O
at O
his O
feet O
, O
entreated O
him O
to O
spare O
her O
, O
confessing O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
she O
loved O
another O
, O
but O
that O
he O
was O
poor O
, O
and O
that O
her O
father O
would O
never O
consent O
to O
the O
union O
. O
My O
generous O
friend O
reassured O
the O
suppliant O
, O
and O
on O
being O
informed O
of O
the O
name O
of O
her O
lover O
instantly O
abandoned O
his O
pursuit O
. O
He O
had O
already O
bought O
a O
farm O
with O
his O
money O
, O
on O
which O
he O
had O
designed O
to O
pass O
the O
remainder O
of O
his O
life O
; O
but O
he O
bestowed O
the O
whole O
on O
his O
rival O
, O
together O
with O
the O
remains O
of O
his O
prize-money O
to O
purchase O
stock O
, O
and O
then O
himself O
solicited O
the O
young O
woman O
's O
father O
to O
consent O
to O
her O
marriage O
with O
her O
lover O
. O
But O
the O
old O
man O
decidedly O
refused O
, O
thinking O
himself O
bound O
in O
honour O
to O
my O
friend O
; O
who O
, O
when O
he O
found O
the O
father O
inexorable O
, O
quitted O
his O
country O
, O
nor O
returned O
until O
he O
heard O
that O
his O
former O
mistress O
was O
married O
according O
to O
her O
inclinations O
. O
" O
What O
a O
noble O
fellow O
! O
" O
you O
will O
exclaim O
. O
He O
is O
so O
; O
but O
then O
he O
has O
passed O
all O
his O
life O
on O
board O
a O
vessel O
, O
and O
has O
scarcely O
an O
idea O
beyond O
the O
rope O
and O
the O
shroud O
. O
But O
do O
not O
suppose O
that O
, O
because O
I O
complain O
a O
little O
, O
or O
because O
I O
can O
conceive O
a O
consolation O
for O
my O
toils O
which O
I O
may O
never O
know O
, O
that O
I O
am O
wavering O
in O
my O
resolutions O
. O
Those O
are O
as O
fixed O
as O
fate O
; O
and O
my O
voyage O
is O
only O
now O
delayed O
until O
the O
weather O
shall O
permit O
my O
embarkation O
. O
The O
winter O
has O
been O
dreadfully O
severe O
; O
but O
the O
spring O
promises O
well O
, O
and O
it O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
remarkably O
early O
season O
; O
so O
that O
, O
perhaps O
, O
I O
may O
sail O
sooner O
than O
I O
expected O
. O
I O
shall O
do O
nothing O
rashly O
; O
you O
know O
me O
sufficiently O
to O
confide O
in O
my O
prudence O
and O
considerateness O
whenever O
the O
safety O
of O
others O
is O
committed O
to O
my O
care O
. O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
to O
you O
my O
sensations O
on O
the O
near O
prospect O
of O
my O
undertaking O
. O
It O
is O
impossible O
to O
communicate O
to O
you O
a O
conception O
of O
the O
trembling O
sensation O
, O
half O
pleasurable O
and O
half O
fearful O
, O
with O
which O
I O
am O
preparing O
to O
depart O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
unexplored O
regions O
, O
to O
" O
the O
land O
of O
mist O
and O
snow O
; O
" O
but O
I O
shall O
kill O
no O
albatross O
, O
therefore O
do O
not O
be O
alarmed O
for O
my O
safety O
. O
Shall O
I O
meet O
you O
again O
, O
after O
having O
traversed O
immense O
seas O
, O
and O
returned O
by O
the O
most O
southern O
cape O
of O
Africa O
or O
America O
? O
I O
dare O
not O
expect O
such O
success O
, O
yet O
I O
can O
not O
bear O
to O
look O
on O
the O
reverse O
of O
the O
picture O
. O
Continue O
to O
write O
to O
me O
by O
every O
opportunity O
: O
I O
may O
receive O
your O
letters O
( O
though O
the O
chance O
is O
very O
doubtful O
) O
on O
some O
occasions O
when O
I O
need O
them O
most O
to O
support O
my O
spirits O
. O
I O
love O
you O
very O
tenderly O
. O
Remember O
me O
with O
affection O
, O
should O
you O
never O
hear O
from O
me O
again O
. O

affectionate O
brother O
