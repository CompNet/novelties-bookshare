DAY O
after O
day O
, O
week O
after O
week O
, O
passed O
away O
on O
my O
return O
to O
Geneva O
; O
and O
I O
could O
not O
collect O
the O
courage O
to O
recommence O
my O
work O
. O
I O
feared O
the O
vengeance O
of O
the O
disappointed O
fiend O
, O
yet O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
overcome O
my O
repugnance O
to O
the O
task O
which O
was O
enjoined O
me O
. O
I O
found O
that O
I O
could O
not O
compose O
a O
female O
without O
again O
devoting O
several O
months O
to O
profound O
study O
and O
laborious O
disquisition O
. O
I O
had O
heard O
of O
some O
discoveries O
having O
been O
made O
by O
an O
English O
philosopher O
, O
the O
knowledge O
of O
which O
was O
material O
to O
my O
success O
, O
and O
I O
sometimes O
thought O
of O
obtaining O
my O
father O
's O
consent O
to O
visit O
England O
for O
this O
purpose O
; O
but O
I O
clung O
to O
every O
pretence O
of O
delay O
, O
and O
could O
not O
resolve O
to O
interrupt O
my O
returning O
tranquillity O
. O
My O
health O
, O
which O
had O
hitherto O
declined O
, O
was O
now O
much O
restored O
; O
and O
my O
spirits O
, O
when O
unchecked O
by O
the O
memory O
of O
my O
unhappy O
promise O
, O
rose O
proportionably O
. O
My O
father O
saw O
this O
change O
with O
pleasure O
, O
and O
he O
turned O
his O
thoughts O
towards O
the O
best O
method O
of O
eradicating O
the O
remains O
of O
my O
melancholy O
, O
which O
every O
now O
and O
then O
would O
return O
by O
fits O
, O
and O
with O
a O
devouring O
blackness O
overcast O
the O
approaching O
sunshine O
. O
At O
these O
moments O
I O
took O
refuge O
in O
the O
most O
perfect O
solitude O
. O
I O
passed O
whole O
days O
on O
the O
lake O
alone O
in O
a O
little O
boat O
, O
watching O
the O
clouds O
, O
and O
listening O
to O
the O
rippling O
of O
the O
waves O
, O
silent O
and O
listless O
. O
But O
the O
fresh O
air O
and O
bright O
sun O
seldom O
failed O
to O
restore O
me O
to O
some O
degree O
of O
composure O
; O
and O
, O
on O
my O
return O
, O
I O
met O
the O
salutations O
of O
my O
friends O
with O
a O
readier O
smile O
and O
a O
more O
cheerful O
heart O
. O
It O
was O
after O
my O
return O
from O
one O
of O
these O
rambles O
that O
my O
father O
, O
calling O
me O
aside O
, O
thus O
addressed O
me O
: O
— O
" O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
remark O
, O
my O
dear O
son O
, O
that O
you O
have O
resumed O
your O
former O
pleasures O
, O
and O
seem O
to O
be O
returning O
to O
yourself O
. O
And O
yet O
you O
are O
still O
unhappy O
, O
and O
still O
avoid O
our O
society O
. O
For O
some O
time O
I O
was O
lost O
in O
conjecture O
as O
to O
the O
cause O
of O
this O
; O
but O
yesterday O
an O
idea O
struck O
me O
, O
and O
if O
it O
is O
well O
founded O
, O
I O
conjure O
you O
to O
avow O
it O
. O
Reserve O
on O
such O
a O
point O
would O
be O
not O
only O
useless O
, O
but O
draw O
down O
treble O
misery O
on O
us O
all O
. O
" O
I O
trembled O
violently O
at O
this O
exordium O
, O
and O
my O
father O
continued— O
" O
I O
confess O
, O
my O
son O
, O
that O
I O
have O
always O
looked O
forward O
to O
your O
marriage O
with O
your O
cousin O
as O
the O
tie O
of O
our O
domestic O
comfort O
, O
and O
the O
stay O
of O
my O
declining O
years O
. O
You O
were O
attached O
to O
each O
other O
from O
your O
earliest O
infancy O
; O
you O
studied O
together O
, O
and O
appeared O
, O
in O
dispositions O
and O
tastes O
, O
entirely O
suited O
to O
one O
another O
. O
But O
so O
blind O
is O
the O
experience O
of O
man O
, O
that O
what O
I O
conceived O
to O
be O
the O
best O
assistants O
to O
my O
plan O
may O
have O
entirely O
destroyed O
it O
. O
You O
, O
perhaps O
, O
regard O
her O
as O
your O
sister O
, O
without O
any O
wish O
that O
she O
might O
become O
your O
wife O
. O
Nay O
, O
you O
may O
have O
met O
with O
another O
whom O
you O
may O
love O
; O
and O
, O
considering O
yourself O
as O
bound O
in O
honour O
to O
your O
cousin O
, O
this O
struggle O
may O
occasion O
the O
poignant O
misery O
which O
you O
appear O
to O
feel O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
father O
, O
re-assure O
yourself O
. O
I O
love O
my O
cousin O
tenderly O
and O
sincerely O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
any O
woman O
who O
excited O
, O
as O
Elizabeth O
does O
, O
my O
warmest O
admiration O
and O
affection O
. O
My O
future O
hopes O
and O
prospects O
are O
entirely O
bound O
up O
in O
the O
expectation O
of O
our O
union O
. O
" O
" O
The O
expression O
of O
your O
sentiments O
on O
this O
subject O
, O
my O
dear O
Victor O
, O
gives O
me O
more O
pleasure O
than O
I O
have O
for O
some O
time O
experienced O
. O
If O
you O
feel O
thus O
, O
we O
shall O
assuredly O
be O
happy O
, O
however O
present O
events O
may O
cast O
a O
gloom O
over O
us O
. O
But O
it O
is O
this O
gloom O
, O
which O
appears O
to O
have O
taken O
so O
strong O
a O
hold O
of O
your O
mind O
, O
that O
I O
wish O
to O
dissipate O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
therefore O
, O
whether O
you O
object O
to O
an O
immediate O
solemnization O
of O
the O
marriage O
. O
We O
have O
been O
unfortunate O
, O
and O
recent O
events O
have O
drawn O
us O
from O
that O
every-day O
tranquillity O
befitting O
my O
years O
and O
infirmities O
. O
You O
are O
younger O
; O
yet O
I O
do O
not O
suppose O
, O
possessed O
as O
you O
are O
of O
a O
competent O
fortune O
, O
that O
an O
early O
marriage O
would O
at O
all O
interfere O
with O
any O
future O
plans O
of O
honour O
and O
utility O
that O
you O
may O
have O
formed O
. O
Do O
not O
suppose O
, O
however O
, O
that O
I O
wish O
to O
dictate O
happiness O
to O
you O
, O
or O
that O
a O
delay O
on O
your O
part O
would O
cause O
me O
any O
serious O
uneasiness O
. O
Interpret O
my O
words O
with O
candour O
, O
and O
answer O
me O
, O
I O
conjure O
you O
, O
with O
confidence O
and O
sincerity O
. O
" O
I O
listened O
to O
my O
father O
in O
silence O
, O
and O
remained O
for O
some O
time O
incapable O
of O
offering O
any O
reply O
. O
I O
revolved O
rapidly O
in O
my O
mind O
a O
multitude O
of O
thoughts O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
arrive O
at O
some O
conclusion O
. O
Alas O
! O
to O
me O
the O
idea O
of O
an O
immediate O
union O
with O
my O
cousin O
was O
one O
of O
horror O
and O
dismay O
. O
I O
was O
bound O
by O
a O
solemn O
promise O
, O
which O
I O
had O
not O
yet O
fulfilled O
, O
and O
dared O
not O
break O
; O
or O
, O
if O
I O
did O
, O
what O
manifold O
miseries O
might O
not O
impend O
over O
me O
and O
my O
devoted O
family O
! O
Could O
I O
enter O
into O
a O
festival O
with O
this O
deadly O
weight O
yet O
hanging O
round O
my O
neck O
, O
and O
bowing O
me O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
I O
must O
perform O
my O
engagement O
, O
and O
let O
the O
monster O
depart O
with O
his O
mate O
, O
before O
I O
allowed O
myself O
to O
enjoy O
the O
delight O
of O
an O
union O
from O
which O
I O
expected O
peace O
. O
I O
remembered O
also O
the O
necessity O
imposed O
upon O
me O
of O
either O
journeying O
to O
England O
, O
or O
entering O
into O
a O
long O
correspondence O
with O
those O
philosophers O
of O
that O
country O
, O
whose O
knowledge O
and O
discoveries O
were O
of O
indispensable O
use O
to O
me O
in O
my O
present O
undertaking O
. O
The O
latter O
method O
of O
obtaining O
the O
desired O
intelligence O
was O
dilatory O
and O
unsatisfactory O
: O
besides O
, O
any O
variation O
was O
agreeable O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
was O
delighted O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
spending O
a O
year O
or O
two O
in O
change O
of O
scene O
and O
variety O
of O
occupation O
, O
in O
absence O
from O
my O
family O
; O
during O
which O
period O
some O
event O
might O
happen O
which O
would O
restore O
me O
to O
them O
in O
peace O
and O
happiness O
: O
my O
promise O
might O
be O
fulfilled O
, O
and O
the O
monster O
have O
departed O
; O
or O
some O
accident O
might O
occur O
to O
destroy O
him O
, O
and O
put O
an O
end O
to O
my O
slavery O
for O
ever O
. O
These O
feelings O
dictated O
my O
answer O
to O
my O
father O
. O
I O
expressed O
a O
wish O
to O
visit O
England O
; O
but O
, O
concealing O
the O
true O
reasons O
of O
this O
request O
, O
I O
clothed O
my O
desires O
under O
the O
guise O
of O
wishing O
to O
travel O
and O
see O
the O
world O
before O
I O
sat O
down O
for O
life O
within O
the O
walls O
of O
my O
native O
town O
. O
I O
urged O
my O
entreaty O
with O
earnestness O
, O
and O
my O
father O
was O
easily O
induced O
to O
comply O
; O
for O
a O
more O
indulgent O
and O
less O
dictatorial O
parent O
did O
not O
exist O
upon O
earth O
. O
Our O
plan O
was O
soon O
arranged O
. O
I O
should O
travel O
to O
Strasburgh O
, O
where O
Clerval O
would O
join O
me O
. O
Some O
short O
time O
would O
be O
spent O
in O
the O
towns O
of O
Holland O
, O
and O
our O
principal O
stay O
would O
be O
in O
England O
. O
We O
should O
return O
by O
France O
; O
and O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
the O
tour O
should O
occupy O
the O
space O
of O
two O
years O
. O
My O
father O
pleased O
himself O
with O
the O
reflection O
, O
that O
my O
union O
with O
Elizabeth O
should O
take O
place O
immediately O
on O
my O
return O
to O
Geneva O
. O
" O
These O
two O
years O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
will O
pass O
swiftly O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
the O
last O
delay O
that O
will O
oppose O
itself O
to O
your O
happiness O
. O
And O
, O
indeed O
, O
I O
earnestly O
desire O
that O
period O
to O
arrive O
, O
when O
we O
shall O
all O
be O
united O
, O
and O
neither O
hopes O
or O
fears O
arise O
to O
disturb O
our O
domestic O
calm O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
content O
, O
" O
I O
replied O
, O
" O
with O
your O
arrangement O
. O
By O
that O
time O
we O
shall O
both O
have O
become O
wiser O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
happier O
, O
than O
we O
at O
present O
are O
. O
" O
I O
sighed O
; O
but O
my O
father O
kindly O
forbore O
to O
question O
me O
further O
concerning O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
dejection O
. O
He O
hoped O
that O
new O
scenes O
, O
and O
the O
amusement O
of O
travelling O
, O
would O
restore O
my O
tranquillity O
. O
I O
now O
made O
arrangements O
for O
my O
journey O
; O
but O
one O
feeling O
haunted O
me O
, O
which O
filled O
me O
with O
fear O
and O
agitation O
. O
During O
my O
absence O
I O
should O
leave O
my O
friends O
unconscious O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
their O
enemy O
, O
and O
unprotected O
from O
his O
attacks O
, O
exasperated O
as O
he O
might O
be O
by O
my O
departure O
. O
But O
he O
had O
promised O
to O
follow O
me O
wherever O
I O
might O
go O
; O
and O
would O
he O
not O
accompany O
me O
to O
England O
? O
This O
imagination O
was O
dreadful O
in O
itself O
, O
but O
soothing O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
supposed O
the O
safety O
of O
my O
friends O
. O
I O
was O
agonized O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
reverse O
of O
this O
might O
happen O
. O
But O
through O
the O
whole O
period O
during O
which O
I O
was O
the O
slave O
of O
my O
creature O
, O
I O
allowed O
myself O
to O
be O
governed O
by O
the O
impulses O
of O
the O
moment O
; O
and O
my O
present O
sensations O
strongly O
intimated O
that O
the O
fiend O
would O
follow O
me O
, O
and O
exempt O
my O
family O
from O
the O
danger O
of O
his O
machinations O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
latter O
end O
of O
August O
that O
I O
departed O
, O
to O
pass O
two O
years O
of O
exile O
. O
Elizabeth O
approved O
of O
the O
reasons O
of O
my O
departure O
, O
and O
only O
regretted O
that O
she O
had O
not O
the O
same O
opportunities O
of O
enlarging O
her O
experience O
, O
and O
cultivating O
her O
understanding O
. O
She O
wept O
, O
however O
, O
as O
she O
bade O
me O
farewell O
, O
and O
entreated O
me O
to O
return O
happy O
and O
tranquil O
. O
" O
We O
all O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
depend O
upon O
you O
; O
and O
if O
you O
are O
miserable O
, O
what O
must O
be O
our O
feelings O
? O
" O
I O
threw O
myself O
into O
the O
carriage O
that O
was O
to O
convey O
me O
away O
, O
hardly O
knowing O
whither O
I O
was O
going O
, O
and O
careless O
of O
what O
was O
passing O
around O
. O
I O
remembered O
only O
, O
and O
it O
was O
with O
a O
bitter O
anguish O
that O
I O
reflected O
on O
it O
, O
to O
order O
that O
my O
chemical O
instruments O
should O
be O
packed O
to O
go O
with O
me O
: O
for O
I O
resolved O
to O
fulfil O
my O
promise O
while O
abroad O
, O
and O
return O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
a O
free O
man O
. O
Filled O
with O
dreary O
imaginations O
, O
I O
passed O
through O
many O
beautiful O
and O
majestic O
scenes O
; O
but O
my O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
and O
unobserving O
. O
I O
could O
only O
think O
of O
the O
bourne O
of O
my O
travels O
, O
and O
the O
work O
which O
was O
to O
occupy O
me O
whilst O
they O
endured O
. O
After O
some O
days O
spent O
in O
listless O
indolence O
, O
during O
which O
I O
traversed O
many O
leagues O
, O
I O
arrived O
at O
Strasburgh O
, O
where O
I O
waited O
two O
days O
for O
Clerval O
. O
He O
came O
. O
Alas O
, O
how O
great O
was O
the O
contrast O
between O
us O
! O
He O
was O
alive O
to O
every O
new O
scene O
; O
joyful O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
beauties O
of O
the O
setting O
sun O
, O
and O
more O
happy O
when O
he O
beheld O
it O
rise O
, O
and O
recommence O
a O
new O
day O
. O
He O
pointed O
out O
to O
me O
the O
shifting O
colours O
of O
the O
landscape O
, O
and O
the O
appearances O
of O
the O
sky O
. O
" O
This O
is O
what O
it O
is O
to O
live O
, O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
" O
now O
I O
enjoy O
existence O
! O
But O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
Frankenstein O
, O
wherefore O
are O
you O
desponding O
and O
sorrowful O
? O
" O
In O
truth O
, O
I O
was O
occupied O
by O
gloomy O
thoughts O
, O
and O
neither O
saw O
the O
descent O
of O
the O
evening O
star O
, O
nor O
the O
golden O
sun-rise O
reflected O
in O
the O
Rhine.—And O
you O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
would O
be O
far O
more O
amused O
with O
the O
journal O
of O
Clerval O
, O
who O
observed O
the O
scenery O
with O
an O
eye O
of O
feeling O
and O
delight O
, O
than O
to O
listen O
to O
my O
reflections O
. O
I O
, O
a O
miserable O
wretch O
, O
haunted O
by O
a O
curse O
that O
shut O
up O
every O
avenue O
to O
enjoyment O
. O
We O
had O
agreed O
to O
descend O
the O
Rhine O
in O
a O
boat O
from O
Strasburgh O
to O
Rotterdam O
, O
whence O
we O
might O
take O
shipping O
for O
London O
. O
During O
this O
voyage O
, O
we O
passed O
by O
many O
willowy O
islands O
, O
and O
saw O
several O
beautiful O
towns O
. O
We O
staid O
a O
day O
at O
Manheim O
, O
and O
, O
on O
the O
fifth O
from O
our O
departure O
from O
Strasburgh O
, O
arrived O
at O
Mayence O
. O
The O
course O
of O
the O
Rhine O
below O
Mayence O
becomes O
much O
more O
picturesque O
. O
The O
river O
descends O
rapidly O
, O
and O
winds O
between O
hills O
, O
not O
high O
, O
but O
steep O
, O
and O
of O
beautiful O
forms O
. O
We O
saw O
many O
ruined O
castles O
standing O
on O
the O
edges O
of O
precipices O
, O
surrounded O
by O
black O
woods O
, O
high O
and O
inaccessible O
. O
This O
part O
of O
the O
Rhine O
, O
indeed O
, O
presents O
a O
singularly O
variegated O
landscape O
. O
In O
one O
spot O
you O
view O
rugged O
hills O
, O
ruined O
castles O
overlooking O
tremendous O
precipices O
, O
with O
the O
dark O
Rhine O
rushing O
beneath O
; O
and O
, O
on O
the O
sudden O
turn O
of O
a O
promontory O
, O
flourishing O
vineyards O
, O
with O
green O
sloping O
banks O
, O
and O
a O
meandering O
river O
, O
and O
populous O
towns O
, O
occupy O
the O
scene O
. O
We O
travelled O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
vintage O
, O
and O
heard O
the O
song O
of O
the O
labourers O
, O
as O
we O
glided O
down O
the O
stream O
. O
Even O
I O
, O
depressed O
in O
mind O
, O
and O
my O
spirits O
continually O
agitated O
by O
gloomy O
feelings O
, O
even O
I O
was O
pleased O
. O
I O
lay O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
, O
as O
I O
gazed O
on O
the O
cloudless O
blue O
sky O
, O
I O
seemed O
to O
drink O
in O
a O
tranquillity O
to O
which O
I O
had O
long O
been O
a O
stranger O
. O
And O
if O
these O
were O
my O
sensations O
, O
who O
can O
describe O
those O
of O
Henry O
? O
He O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
transported O
to O
Fairy-land O
, O
and O
enjoyed O
a O
happiness O
seldom O
tasted O
by O
man O
. O
" O
I O
have O
seen O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
the O
most O
beautiful O
scenes O
of O
my O
own O
country O
; O
I O
have O
visited O
the O
lakes O
of O
Lucerne O
and O
Uri O
, O
where O
the O
snowy O
mountains O
descend O
almost O
perpendicularly O
to O
the O
water O
, O
casting O
black O
and O
impenetrable O
shades O
, O
which O
would O
cause O
a O
gloomy O
and O
mournful O
appearance O
, O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
most O
verdant O
islands O
that O
relieve O
the O
eye O
by O
their O
gay O
appearance O
; O
I O
have O
seen O
this O
lake O
agitated O
by O
a O
tempest O
, O
when O
the O
wind O
tore O
up O
whirlwinds O
of O
water O
, O
and O
gave O
you O
an O
idea O
of O
what O
the O
water-spout O
must O
be O
on O
the O
great O
ocean O
, O
and O
the O
waves O
dash O
with O
fury O
the O
base O
of O
the O
mountain O
, O
where O
the O
priest O
and O
his O
mistress O
were O
overwhelmed O
by O
an O
avalanche O
, O
and O
where O
their O
dying O
voices O
are O
still O
said O
to O
be O
heard O
amid O
the O
pauses O
of O
the O
nightly O
wind O
; O
I O
have O
seen O
the O
mountains O
of O
La O
Valais O
, O
and O
the O
Pays O
de O
Vaud O
: O
but O
this O
country O
, O
Victor O
, O
pleases O
me O
more O
than O
all O
those O
wonders O
. O
The O
mountains O
of O
Switzerland O
are O
more O
majestic O
and O
strange O
; O
but O
there O
is O
a O
charm O
in O
the O
banks O
of O
this O
divine O
river O
, O
that O
I O
never O
before O
saw O
equalled O
. O
Look O
at O
that O
castle O
which O
overhangs O
yon O
precipice O
; O
and O
that O
also O
on O
the O
island O
, O
almost O
concealed O
amongst O
the O
foliage O
of O
those O
lovely O
trees O
; O
and O
now O
that O
group O
of O
labourers O
coming O
from O
among O
their O
vines O
; O
and O
that O
village O
half-hid O
in O
the O
recess O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O
Oh O
, O
surely O
, O
the O
spirit O
that O
inhabits O
and O
guards O
this O
place O
has O
a O
soul O
more O
in O
harmony O
with O
man O
, O
than O
those O
who O
pile O
the O
glacier O
, O
or O
retire O
to O
the O
inaccessible O
peaks O
of O
the O
mountains O
of O
our O
own O
country O

overflowing O
with O
the O
anguish O
which O
his O
remembrance O
creates O

I O
will O
proceed O
with O
my O
tale O
. O
Beyond O
Cologne O
we O
descended O
to O
the O
plains O
of O
Holland O
; O
and O
we O
resolved O
to O
post O
the O
remainder O
of O
our O
way O
; O
for O
the O
wind O
was O
contrary O
, O
and O
the O
stream O
of O
the O
river O
was O
too O
gentle O
to O
aid O
us O
. O
Our O
journey O
here O
lost O
the O
interest O
arising O
from O
beautiful O
scenery O
; O
but O
we O
arrived O
in O
a O
few O
days O
at O
Rotterdam O
, O
whence O
we O
proceeded O
by O
sea O
to O
England O
. O
It O
was O
on O
a O
clear O
morning O
, O
in O
the O
latter O
days O
of O
December O
, O
that O
I O
first O
saw O
the O
white O
cliffs O
of O
Britain O
. O
The O
banks O
of O
the O
Thames O
presented O
a O
new O
scene O
; O
they O
were O
flat O
, O
but O
fertile O
, O
and O
almost O
every O
town O
was O
marked O
by O
the O
remembrance O
of O
some O
story O
. O
We O
saw O
Tilbury O
Fort O
, O
and O
remembered O
the O
Spanish O
armada O
; O
Gravesend O
, O
Woolwich O
, O
and O
Greenwich O
, O
places O
which O
I O
had O
heard O
of O
even O
in O
my O
country O
. O
At O
length O
we O
saw O
the O
numerous O
steeples O
of O
London O
, O
St. O
Paul O
's O
towering O
above O
all O
, O
and O
the O
Tower O
famed O
in O

history O
