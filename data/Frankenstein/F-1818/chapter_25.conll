WE O
had O
resolved O
not O
to O
go O
to O
London O
, O
but O
to O
cross O
the O
country O
to O
Portsmouth O
, O
and O
thence O
to O
embark O
for O
Havre O
. O
I O
preferred O
this O
plan O
principally O
because O
I O
dreaded O
to O
see O
again O
those O
places O
in O
which O
I O
had O
enjoyed O
a O
few O
moments O
of O
tranquillity O
with O
my O
beloved O
Clerval O
. O
I O
thought O
with O
horror O
of O
seeing O
again O
those O
persons O
whom O
we O
had O
been O
accustomed O
to O
visit O
together O
, O
and O
who O
might O
make O
inquiries O
concerning O
an O
event O
, O
the O
very O
remembrance O
of O
which O
made O
me O
again O
feel O
the O
pang O
I O
endured O
when O
I O
gazed O
on O
his O
lifeless O
form O
in O
the O
inn O
at—— O
. O
As O
for O
my O
father O
, O
his O
desires O
and O
exertions O
were O
bounded O
to O
the O
again O
seeing O
me O
restored O
to O
health O
and O
peace O
of O
mind O
. O
His O
tenderness O
and O
attentions O
were O
unremitting O
; O
my O
grief O
and O
gloom O
was O
obstinate O
, O
but O
he O
would O
not O
despair O
. O
Sometimes O
he O
thought O
that O
I O
felt O
deeply O
the O
degradation O
of O
being O
obliged O
to O
answer O
a O
charge O
of O
murder O
, O
and O
he O
endeavoured O
to O
prove O
to O
me O
the O
futility O
of O
pride O
. O
" O
Alas O
! O
my O
father O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
how O
little O
do O
you O
know O
me O
. O
Human O
beings O
, O
their O
feelings O
and O
passions O
, O
would O
indeed O
be O
degraded O
, O
if O
such O
a O
wretch O
as O
I O
felt O
pride O
. O
Justine O
, O
poor O
unhappy O
Justine O
, O
was O
as O
innocent O
as O
I O
, O
and O
she O
suffered O
the O
same O
charge O
; O
she O
died O
for O
it O
; O
and O
I O
am O
the O
cause O
of O
this—I O
murdered O
her O
. O
William O
, O
Justine O
, O
and O
Henry—they O
all O
died O
by O
my O
hands O
. O
" O
My O
father O
had O
often O
, O
during O
my O
imprisonment O
, O
heard O
me O
make O
the O
same O
assertion O
; O
when O
I O
thus O
accused O
myself O
, O
he O
sometimes O
seemed O
to O
desire O
an O
explanation O
, O
and O
at O
others O
he O
appeared O
to O
consider O
it O
as O
caused O
by O
delirium O
, O
and O
that O
, O
during O
my O
illness O
, O
some O
idea O
of O
this O
kind O
had O
presented O
itself O
to O
my O
imagination O
, O
the O
remembrance O
of O
which O
I O
preserved O
in O
my O
convalescence O
. O
I O
avoided O
explanation O
, O
and O
maintained O
a O
continual O
silence O
concerning O
the O
wretch O
I O
had O
created O
. O
I O
had O
a O
feeling O
that O
I O
should O
be O
supposed O
mad O
, O
and O
this O
for O
ever O
chained O
my O
tongue O
, O
when O
I O
would O
have O
given O
the O
whole O
world O
to O
have O
confided O
the O
fatal O
secret O
. O
Upon O
this O
occasion O
my O
father O
said O
, O
with O
an O
expression O
of O
unbounded O
wonder O
, O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
, O
Victor O
? O
are O
you O
mad O
? O
My O
dear O
son O
, O
I O
entreat O
you O
never O
to O
make O
such O
an O
assertion O
again O
. O
" O
" O
I O
am O
not O
mad O
, O
" O
I O
cried O
energetically O
; O
" O
the O
sun O
and O
the O
heavens O
, O
who O
have O
viewed O
my O
operations O
, O
can O
bear O
witness O
of O
my O
truth O
. O
I O
am O
the O
assassin O
of O
those O
most O
innocent O
victims O
; O
they O
died O
by O
my O
machinations O
. O
A O
thousand O
times O
would O
I O
have O
shed O
my O
own O
blood O
, O
drop O
by O
drop O
, O
to O
have O
saved O
their O
lives O
; O
but O
I O
could O
not O
, O
my O
father O
, O
indeed O
I O
could O
not O
sacrifice O
the O
whole O
human O
race O
. O
" O
The O
conclusion O
of O
this O
speech O
convinced O
my O
father O
that O
my O
ideas O
were O
deranged O
, O
and O
he O
instantly O
changed O
the O
subject O
of O
our O
conversation O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
alter O
the O
course O
of O
my O
thoughts O
. O
He O
wished O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
to O
obliterate O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
scenes O
that O
had O
taken O
place O
in O
Ireland O
, O
and O
never O
alluded O
to O
them O
, O
or O
suffered O
me O
to O
speak O
of O
my O
misfortunes O
. O
As O
time O
passed O
away O
I O
became O
more O
calm O
: O
misery O
had O
her O
dwelling O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
but O
I O
no O
longer O
talked O
in O
the O
same O
incoherent O
manner O
of O
my O
own O
crimes O
; O
sufficient O
for O
me O
was O
the O
consciousness O
of O
them O
. O
By O
the O
utmost O
self-violence O
, O
I O
curbed O
the O
imperious O
voice O
of O
wretchedness O
, O
which O
sometimes O
desired O
to O
declare O
itself O
to O
the O
whole O
world O
; O
and O
my O
manners O
were O
calmer O
and O
more O
composed O
than O
they O
had O
ever O
been O
since O
my O
journey O
to O
the O
sea O
of O
ice O
. O
We O
arrived O
at O
Havre O
on O
the O
8th O
of O
May O
, O
and O
instantly O
proceeded O
to O
Paris O
, O
where O
my O
father O
had O
some O
business O
which O
detained O
us O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O
In O
this O
city O
, O
I O
received O
the O
following O
letter O
from O
Elizabeth O
: O
— O
" O
To O
VICTOR O
FRANKENSTEIN O
. O
" O
MY O
DEAREST O
FRIEND O
, O
" O
It O
gave O
me O
the O
greatest O
pleasure O
to O
receive O
a O
letter O
from O
my O
uncle O
dated O
at O
Paris O
; O
you O
are O
no O
longer O
at O
a O
formidable O
distance O
, O
and O
I O
may O
hope O
to O
see O
you O
in O
less O
than O
a O
fortnight O
. O
My O
poor O
cousin O
, O
how O
much O
you O
must O
have O
suffered O
! O
I O
expect O
to O
see O
you O
looking O
even O
more O
ill O
than O
when O
you O
quitted O
Geneva O
. O
This O
winter O
has O
been O
passed O
most O
miserably O
, O
tortured O
as O
I O
have O
been O
by O
anxious O
suspense O
; O
yet O
I O
hope O
to O
see O
peace O
in O
your O
countenance O
, O
and O
to O
find O
that O
your O
heart O
is O
not O
totally O
devoid O
of O
comfort O
and O
tranquillity O
. O
" O
Yet O
I O
fear O
that O
the O
same O
feelings O
now O
exist O
that O
made O
you O
so O
miserable O
a O
year O
ago O
, O
even O
perhaps O
augmented O
by O
time O
. O
I O
would O
not O
disturb O
you O
at O
this O
period O
, O
when O
so O
many O
misfortunes O
weigh O
upon O
you O
; O
but O
a O
conversation O
that O
I O
had O
with O
my O
uncle O
previous O
to O
his O
departure O
renders O
some O
explanation O
necessary O
before O
we O
meet O
. O
" O
Explanation O
! O
you O
may O
possibly O
say O
; O
what O
can O
Elizabeth O
have O
to O
explain O
? O
If O
you O
really O
say O
this O
, O
my O
questions O
are O
answered O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
more O
to O
do O
than O
to O
sign O
myself O
your O
affectionate O
cousin O
. O
But O
you O
are O
distant O
from O
me O
, O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
that O
you O
may O
dread O
, O
and O
yet O
be O
pleased O
with O
this O
explanation O
; O
and O
, O
in O
a O
probability O
of O
this O
being O
the O
case O
, O
I O
dare O
not O
any O
longer O
postpone O
writing O
what O
, O
during O
your O
absence O
, O
I O
have O
often O
wished O
to O
express O
to O
you O
, O
but O
have O
never O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
begin O
. O
" O
You O
well O
know O
, O
Victor O
, O
that O
our O
union O
had O
been O
the O
favourite O
plan O
of O
your O
parents O
ever O
since O
our O
infancy O
. O
We O
were O
told O
this O
when O
young O
, O
and O
taught O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
it O
as O
an O
event O
that O
would O
certainly O
take O
place O
. O
We O
were O
affectionate O
playfellows O
during O
childhood O
, O
and O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
dear O
and O
valued O
friends O
to O
one O
another O
as O
we O
grew O
older O
. O
But O
as O
brother O
and O
sister O
often O
entertain O
a O
lively O
affection O
towards O
each O
other O
, O
without O
desiring O
a O
more O
intimate O
union O
, O
may O
not O
such O
also O
be O
our O
case O
? O
Tell O
me O
, O
dearest O
Victor O
. O
Answer O
me O
, O
I O
conjure O
you O
, O
by O
our O
mutual O
happiness O
, O
with O
simple O
truth—Do O
you O
not O
love O
another O
? O
" O
You O
have O
travelled O
; O
you O
have O
spent O
several O
years O
of O
your O
life O
at O
Ingolstadt O
; O
and O
I O
confess O
to O
you O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
that O
when O
I O
saw O
you O
last O
autumn O
so O
unhappy O
, O
flying O
to O
solitude O
, O
from O
the O
society O
of O
every O
creature O
, O
I O
could O
not O
help O
supposing O
that O
you O
might O
regret O
our O
connexion O
, O
and O
believe O
yourself O
bound O
in O
honour O
to O
fulfil O
the O
wishes O
of O
your O
parents O
, O
although O
they O
opposed O
themselves O
to O
your O
inclinations O
. O
But O
this O
is O
false O
reasoning O
. O
I O
confess O
to O
you O
, O
my O
cousin O
, O
that O
I O
love O
you O
, O
and O
that O
in O
my O
airy O
dreams O
of O
futurity O
you O
have O
been O
my O
constant O
friend O
and O
companion O
. O
But O
it O
is O
your O
happiness O
I O
desire O
as O
well O
as O
my O
own O
, O
when O
I O
declare O
to O
you O
, O
that O
our O
marriage O
would O
render O
me O
eternally O
miserable O
, O
unless O
it O
were O
the O
dictate O
of O
your O
own O
free O
choice O
. O
Even O
now O
I O
weep O
to O
think O
, O
that O
, O
borne O
down O
as O
you O
are O
by O
the O
cruelest O
misfortunes O
, O
you O
may O
stifle O
, O
by O
the O
word O
honour O
, O
all O
hope O
of O
that O
love O
and O
happiness O
which O
would O
alone O
restore O
you O
to O
yourself O
. O
I O
, O
who O
have O
so O
interested O
an O
affection O
for O
you O
, O
may O
increase O
your O
miseries O
ten-fold O
, O
by O
being O
an O
obstacle O
to O
your O
wishes O
. O
Ah O
, O
Victor O
, O
be O
assured O
that O
your O
cousin O
and O
playmate O
has O
too O
sincere O
a O
love O
for O
you O
not O
to O
be O
made O
miserable O
by O
this O
supposition O
. O
Be O
happy O
, O
my O
friend O
; O
and O
if O
you O
obey O
me O
in O
this O
one O
request O
, O
remain O
satisfied O
that O
nothing O
on O
earth O
will O
have O
the O
power O
to O
interrupt O
my O
tranquillity O

Do O

this O

it O
will O
give O
you O
pain O

your O
health O

see O

one O
smile O
on O
your O
lips O

18th O

17— O
. O
" O
This O
letter O
revived O
in O
my O
memory O
what O
I O
had O
before O
forgotten O
, O
the O
threat O
of O
the O
fiend— O
" O
I O
will O
be O
with O
you O
on O
your O
wedding-night O
! O
" O
Such O
was O
my O
sentence O
, O
and O
on O
that O
night O
would O
the O
dæmon O
employ O
every O
art O
to O
destroy O
me O
, O
and O
tear O
me O
from O
the O
glimpse O
of O
happiness O
which O
promised O
partly O
to O
console O
my O
sufferings O
. O
On O
that O
night O
he O
had O
determined O
to O
consummate O
his O
crimes O
by O
my O
death O
. O
Well O
, O
be O
it O
so O
; O
a O
deadly O
struggle O
would O
then O
assuredly O
take O
place O
, O
in O
which O
if O
he O
was O
victorious O
, O
I O
should O
be O
at O
peace O
, O
and O
his O
power O
over O
me O
be O
at O
an O
end O
. O
If O
he O
were O
vanquished O
, O
I O
should O
be O
a O
free O
man O
. O
Alas O
! O
what O
freedom O
? O
such O
as O
the O
peasant O
enjoys O
when O
his O
family O
have O
been O
massacred O
before O
his O
eyes O
, O
his O
cottage O
burnt O
, O
his O
lands O
laid O
waste O
, O
and O
he O
is O
turned O
adrift O
, O
homeless O
, O
pennyless O
, O
and O
alone O
, O
but O
free O
. O
Such O
would O
be O
my O
liberty O
, O
except O
that O
in O
my O
Elizabeth O
I O
possessed O
a O
treasure O
; O
alas O
! O
balanced O
by O
those O
horrors O
of O
remorse O
and O
guilt O
, O
which O
would O
pursue O
me O
until O
death O
. O
Sweet O
and O
beloved O
Elizabeth O
! O
I O
read O
and O
re-read O
her O
letter O
, O
and O
some O
softened O
feelings O
stole O
into O
my O
heart O
, O
and O
dared O
to O
whisper O
paradisaical O
dreams O
of O
love O
and O
joy O
; O
but O
the O
apple O
was O
already O
eaten O
, O
and O
the O
angel O
's O
arm O
bared O
to O
drive O
me O
from O
all O
hope O
. O
Yet O
I O
would O
die O
to O
make O
her O
happy O
. O
If O
the O
monster O
executed O
his O
threat O
, O
death O
was O
inevitable O
; O
yet O
, O
again O
, O
I O
considered O
whether O
my O
marriage O
would O
hasten O
my O
fate O
. O
My O
destruction O
might O
indeed O
arrive O
a O
few O
months O
sooner O
; O
but O
if O
my O
torturer O
should O
suspect O
that O
I O
postponed O
it O
, O
influenced O
by O
his O
menaces O
, O
he O
would O
surely O
find O
other O
, O
and O
perhaps O
more O
dreadful O
means O
of O
revenge O
. O
He O
had O
vowed O
to O
be O
with O
me O
on O
my O
wedding-night O
, O
yet O
he O
did O
not O
consider O
that O
threat O
as O
binding O
him O
to O
peace O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
; O
for O
, O
as O
if O
to O
shew O
me O
that O
he O
was O
not O
yet O
satiated O
with O
blood O
, O
he O
had O
murdered O
Clerval O
immediately O
after O
the O
enunciation O
of O
his O
threats O
. O
I O
resolved O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
if O
my O
immediate O
union O
with O
my O
cousin O
would O
conduce O
either O
to O
her O
's O
or O
my O
father O
's O
happiness O
, O
my O
adversary O
's O
designs O
against O
my O
life O
should O
not O
retard O
it O
a O
single O
hour O
. O
In O
this O
state O
of O
mind O
I O
wrote O
to O
Elizabeth O
. O
My O
letter O
was O
calm O
and O
affectionate O
. O
" O
I O
fear O
, O
my O
beloved O
girl O
, O
" O
I O
said O
, O
" O
little O
happiness O
remains O
for O
us O
on O
earth O
; O
yet O
all O
that O
I O
may O
one O
day O
enjoy O
is O
concentered O
in O
you O
. O
Chase O
away O
your O
idle O
fears O
; O
to O
you O
alone O
do O
I O
consecrate O
my O
life O
, O
and O
my O
endeavours O
for O
contentment O
. O
I O
have O
one O
secret O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
a O
dreadful O
one O
; O
when O
revealed O
to O
you O
, O
it O
will O
chill O
your O
frame O
with O
horror O
, O
and O
then O
, O
far O
from O
being O
surprised O
at O
my O
misery O
, O
you O
will O
only O
wonder O
that O
I O
survive O
what O
I O
have O
endured O
. O
I O
will O
confide O
this O
tale O
of O
misery O
and O
terror O
to O
you O
the O
day O
after O
our O
marriage O
shall O
take O
place O
; O
for O
, O
my O
sweet O
cousin O
, O
there O
must O
be O
perfect O
confidence O
between O
us O
. O
But O
until O
then O
, O
I O
conjure O
you O
, O
do O
not O
mention O
or O
allude O
to O
it O
. O
This O
I O
most O
earnestly O
entreat O
, O
and O
I O
know O
you O
will O
comply O
. O
" O
In O
about O
a O
week O
after O
the O
arrival O
of O
Elizabeth O
's O
letter O
, O
we O
returned O
to O
Geneva O
. O
My O
cousin O
welcomed O
me O
with O
warm O
affection O
; O
yet O
tears O
were O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
as O
she O
beheld O
my O
emaciated O
frame O
and O
feverish O
cheeks O
. O
I O
saw O
a O
change O
in O
her O
also O
. O
She O
was O
thinner O
, O
and O
had O
lost O
much O
of O
that O
heavenly O
vivacity O
that O
had O
before O
charmed O
me O
; O
but O
her O
gentleness O
, O
and O
soft O
looks O
of O
compassion O
, O
made O
her O
a O
more O
fit O
companion O
for O
one O
blasted O
and O
miserable O
as O
I O
was O
. O
The O
tranquillity O
which O
I O
now O
enjoyed O
did O
not O
endure O
. O
Memory O
brought O
madness O
with O
it O
; O
and O
when O
I O
thought O
of O
what O
had O
passed O
, O
a O
real O
insanity O
possessed O
me O
; O
sometimes O
I O
was O
furious O
, O
and O
burnt O
with O
rage O
, O
sometimes O
low O
and O
despondent O
. O
I O
neither O
spoke O
or O
looked O
, O
but O
sat O
motionless O
, O
bewildered O
by O
the O
multitude O
of O
miseries O
that O
overcame O
me O
. O
Elizabeth O
alone O
had O
the O
power O
to O
draw O
me O
from O
these O
fits O
; O
her O
gentle O
voice O
would O
soothe O
me O
when O
transported O
by O
passion O
, O
and O
inspire O
me O
with O
human O
feelings O
when O
sunk O
in O
torpor O
. O
She O
wept O
with O
me O
, O
and O
for O
me O
. O
When O
reason O
returned O
, O
she O
would O
remonstrate O
, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
inspire O
me O
with O
resignation O
. O
Ah O
! O
it O
is O
well O
for O
the O
unfortunate O
to O
be O
resigned O
, O
but O
for O
the O
guilty O
there O
is O
no O
peace O
. O
The O
agonies O
of O
remorse O
poison O
the O
luxury O
there O
is O
otherwise O
sometimes O
found O
in O
indulging O
the O
excess O
of O
grief O
. O
Soon O
after O
my O
arrival O
my O
father O
spoke O
of O
my O
immediate O
marriage O
with O
my O
cousin O
. O
I O
remained O
silent O
. O
" O
Have O
you O
, O
then O
, O
some O
other O
attachment O
? O
" O
" O
None O
on O
earth O
. O
I O
love O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
look O
forward O
to O
our O
union O
with O
delight O
. O
Let O
the O
day O
therefore O
be O
fixed O
; O
and O
on O
it O
I O
will O
consecrate O
myself O
, O
in O
life O
or O
death O
, O
to O
the O
happiness O
of O
my O
cousin O
. O
" O
" O
My O
dear O
Victor O
, O
do O
not O
speak O
thus O
. O
Heavy O
misfortunes O
have O
befallen O
us O
; O
but O
let O
us O
only O
cling O
closer O
to O
what O
remains O
, O
and O
transfer O
our O
love O
for O
those O
whom O
we O
have O
lost O
to O
those O
who O
yet O
live O
. O
Our O
circle O
will O
be O
small O
, O
but O
bound O
close O
by O
the O
ties O
of O
affection O
and O
mutual O
misfortune O
. O
And O
when O
time O
shall O
have O
softened O
your O
despair O
, O
new O
and O
dear O
objects O
of O
care O
will O
be O
born O
to O
replace O
those O
of O
whom O
we O
have O
been O
so O
cruelly O
deprived O
. O
" O
Such O
were O
the O
lessons O
of O
my O
father O
. O
But O
to O
me O
the O
remembrance O
of O
the O
threat O
returned O
: O
nor O
can O
you O
wonder O
, O
that O
, O
omnipotent O
as O
the O
fiend O
had O
yet O
been O
in O
his O
deeds O
of O
blood O
, O
I O
should O
almost O
regard O
him O
as O
invincible O
; O
and O
that O
when O
he O
had O
pronounced O
the O
words O
, O
" O
I O
shall O
be O
with O
you O
on O
your O
wedding-night O
, O
" O
I O
should O
regard O
the O
threatened O
fate O
as O
unavoidable O
. O
But O
death O
was O
no O
evil O
to O
me O
, O
if O
the O
loss O
of O
Elizabeth O
were O
balanced O
with O
it O
; O
and O
I O
therefore O
, O
with O
a O
contented O
and O
even O
cheerful O
countenance O
, O
agreed O
with O
my O
father O
, O
that O
if O
my O
cousin O
would O
consent O
, O
the O
ceremony O
should O
take O
place O
in O
ten O
days O
, O
and O
thus O
put O
, O
as O
I O
imagined O
, O
the O
seal O
to O
my O
fate O
. O
Great O
God O
! O
if O
for O
one O
instant O
I O
had O
thought O
what O
might O
be O
the O
hellish O
intention O
of O
my O
fiendish O
adversary O
, O
I O
would O
rather O
have O
banished O
myself O
for O
ever O
from O
my O
native O
country O
, O
and O
wandered O
a O
friendless O
outcast O
over O
the O
earth O
, O
than O
have O
consented O
to O
this O
miserable O
marriage O
. O
But O
, O
as O
if O
possessed O
of O
magic O
powers O
, O
the O
monster O
had O
blinded O
me O
to O
his O
real O
intentions O
; O
and O
when O
I O
thought O
that O
I O
prepared O
only O
my O
own O
death O
, O
I O
hastened O
that O
of O
a O
far O
dearer O
victim O
. O
As O
the O
period O
fixed O
for O
our O
marriage O
drew O
nearer O
, O
whether O
from O
cowardice O
or O
a O
prophetic O
feeling O
, O
I O
felt O
my O
heart O
sink O
within O
me O
. O
But O
I O
concealed O
my O
feelings O
by O
an O
appearance O
of O
hilarity O
, O
that O
brought O
smiles O
and O
joy O
to O
the O
countenance O
of O
my O
father O
, O
but O
hardly O
deceived O
the O
ever-watchful O
and O
nicer O
eye O
of O
Elizabeth O
. O
She O
looked O
forward O
to O
our O
union O
with O
placid O
contentment O
, O
not O
unmingled O
with O
a O
little O
fear O
, O
which O
past O
misfortunes O
had O
impressed O
, O
that O
what O
now O
appeared O
certain O
and O
tangible O
happiness O
, O
might O
soon O
dissipate O
into O
an O
airy O
dream O
, O
and O
leave O
no O
trace O
but O
deep O
and O
everlasting O
regret O
. O
Preparations O
were O
made O
for O
the O
event O
; O
congratulatory O
visits O
were O
received O
; O
and O
all O
wore O
a O
smiling O
appearance O
. O
I O
shut O
up O
, O
as O
well O
as O
I O
could O
, O
in O
my O
own O
heart O
the O
anxiety O
that O
preyed O
there O
, O
and O
entered O
with O
seeming O
earnestness O
into O
the O
plans O
of O
my O
father O
, O
although O
they O
might O
only O
serve O
as O
the O
decorations O
of O
my O
tragedy O
. O
A O
house O
was O
purchased O
for O
us O
near O
Cologny O
, O
by O
which O
we O
should O
enjoy O
the O
pleasures O
of O
the O
country O
, O
and O
yet O
be O
so O
near O
Geneva O
as O
to O
see O
my O
father O
every O
day O
; O
who O
would O
still O
reside O
within O
the O
walls O
, O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
Ernest O
, O
that O
he O
might O
follow O
his O
studies O
at O
the O
schools O
. O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
I O
took O
every O
precaution O
to O
defend O
my O
person O
, O
in O
case O
the O
fiend O
should O
openly O
attack O
me O
. O
I O
carried O
pistols O
and O
a O
dagger O
constantly O
about O
me O
, O
and O
was O
ever O
on O
the O
watch O
to O
prevent O
artifice O
; O
and O
by O
these O
means O
gained O
a O
greater O
degree O
of O
tranquillity O
. O
Indeed O
, O
as O
the O
period O
approached O
, O
the O
threat O
appeared O
more O
as O
a O
delusion O
, O
not O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
worthy O
to O
disturb O
my O
peace O
, O
while O
the O
happiness O
I O
hoped O
for O
in O
my O
marriage O
wore O
a O
greater O
appearance O
of O
certainty O
, O
as O
the O
day O
fixed O
for O
its O
solemnization O
drew O
nearer O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
it O
continually O
spoken O
of O
as O
an O
occurrence O
which O
no O
accident O
could O
possibly O
prevent O
. O
Elizabeth O
seemed O
happy O
; O
my O
tranquil O
demeanour O
contributed O
greatly O
to O
calm O
her O
mind O
. O
But O
on O
the O
day O
that O
was O
to O
fulfil O
my O
wishes O
and O
my O
destiny O
, O
she O
was O
melancholy O
, O
and O
a O
presentiment O
of O
evil O
pervaded O
her O
; O
and O
perhaps O
also O
she O
thought O
of O
the O
dreadful O
secret O
, O
which O
I O
had O
promised O
to O
reveal O
to O
her O
the O
following O
day O
. O
My O
father O
was O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
overjoyed O
; O
and O
, O
in O
the O
bustle O
of O
preparation O
, O
only O
observed O
in O
the O
melancholy O
of O
his O
niece O
the O
diffidence O
of O
a O
bride O
. O
After O
the O
ceremony O
was O
performed O
, O
a O
large O
party O
assembled O
at O
my O
father O
's O
; O
but O
it O
was O
agreed O
that O
Elizabeth O
and O
I O
should O
pass O
the O
afternoon O
and O
night O
at O
Evian O
, O
and O
return O
to O
Cologny O
the O
next O
morning O
. O
As O
the O
day O
was O
fair O
, O
and O
the O
wind O
favourable O
, O
we O
resolved O
to O
go O
by O
water O
. O
Those O
were O
the O
last O
moments O
of O
my O
life O
during O
which O
I O
enjoyed O
the O
feeling O
of O
happiness O
. O
We O
passed O
rapidly O
along O
: O
the O
sun O
was O
hot O
, O
but O
we O
were O
sheltered O
from O
its O
rays O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
canopy O
, O
while O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
beauty O
of O
the O
scene O
, O
sometimes O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
lake O
, O
where O
we O
saw O
Mont O
Salêve O
, O
the O
pleasant O
banks O
of O
Montalêgre O
, O
and O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
surmounting O
all O
, O
the O
beautiful O
Mont O
Blânc O
, O
and O
the O
assemblage O
of O
snowy O
mountains O
that O
in O
vain O
endeavour O
to O
emulate O
her O
; O
sometimes O
coasting O
the O
opposite O
banks O
, O
we O
saw O
the O
mighty O
Jura O
opposing O
its O
dark O
side O
to O
the O
ambition O
that O
would O
quit O
its O
native O
country O
, O
and O
an O
almost O
insurmountable O
barrier O
to O
the O
invader O
who O
should O
wish O
to O
enslave O
it O
. O
I O
took O
the O
hand O
of O
Elizabeth O
: O
" O
You O
are O
sorrowful O
, O
my O
love O
. O
Ah O
! O
if O
you O
knew O
what O
I O
have O
suffered O
, O
and O
what O
I O
may O
yet O
endure O
, O
you O
would O
endeavour O
to O
let O
me O
taste O
the O
quiet O
, O
and O
freedom O
from O
despair O
, O
that O
this O
one O
day O
at O
least O
permits O
me O
to O
enjoy O
. O
" O
" O
Be O
happy O
, O
my O
dear O
Victor O
, O
" O
replied O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
there O
is O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
nothing O
to O
distress O
you O
; O
and O
be O
assured O
that O
if O
a O
lively O
joy O
is O
not O
painted O
in O
my O
face O
, O
my O
heart O
is O
contented O
. O
Something O
whispers O
to O
me O
not O
to O
depend O
too O
much O
on O
the O
prospect O
that O
is O
opened O
before O
us O
; O
but O
I O
will O
not O
listen O
to O
such O
a O
sinister O
voice O
. O
Observe O
how O
fast O
we O
move O
along O
, O
and O
how O
the O
clouds O
which O
sometimes O
obscure O
, O
and O
sometimes O
rise O
above O
the O
dome O
of O
Mont O
Blânc O
, O
render O
this O
scene O
of O
beauty O
still O
more O
interesting O
. O
Look O
also O
at O
the O
innumerable O
fish O
that O
are O
swimming O
in O
the O
clear O
waters O
, O
where O
we O
can O
distinguish O
every O
pebble O
that O
lies O
at O
the O
bottom O
. O
What O
a O
divine O
day O
! O
how O
happy O
and O
serene O
all O
nature O
appears O
! O
" O
Thus O
Elizabeth O
endeavoured O
to O
divert O
her O
thoughts O
and O
mine O
from O
all O
reflection O
upon O
melancholy O
subjects O
. O
But O
her O
temper O
was O
fluctuating O
; O
joy O
for O
a O
few O
instants O
shone O
in O
her O
eyes O
, O
but O
it O
continually O
gave O
place O
to O
distraction O
and O
reverie O
. O
The O
sun O
sunk O
lower O
in O
the O
heavens O
; O
we O
passed O
the O
river O
Drance O
, O
and O
observed O
its O
path O
through O
the O
chasms O
of O
the O
higher O
, O
and O
the O
glens O
of O
the O
lower O
hills O
. O
The O
Alps O
here O
come O
closer O
to O
the O
lake O
, O
and O
we O
approached O
the O
amphitheatre O
of O
mountains O
which O
forms O
its O
eastern O
boundary O
. O
The O
spire O
of O
Evian O
shone O
under O
the O
woods O
that O
surrounded O
it O
, O
and O
the O
range O
of O
mountain O
above O
mountain O
by O
which O
it O
was O
overhung O
. O
The O
wind O
, O
which O
had O
hitherto O
carried O
us O
along O
with O
amazing O
rapidity O
, O
sunk O
at O
sunset O
to O
a O
light O
breeze O
; O
the O
soft O
air O
just O
ruffled O
the O
water O
, O
and O
caused O
a O
pleasant O
motion O
among O
the O
trees O
as O
we O
approached O
the O
shore O
, O
from O
which O
it O
wafted O
the O
most O
delightful O
scent O
of O
flowers O
and O
hay O
. O
The O
sun O
sunk O
beneath O
the O
horizon O
as O
we O
landed O
; O
and O
as O
I O
touched O
the O
shore O
, O
I O
felt O
those O
cares O
and O
fears O
revive O
, O
which O
soon O
were O
to O
clasp O
me O
, O
and O
cling O
to O
me O
for O
ever O
. O
