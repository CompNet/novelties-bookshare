So O
strange O
an O
accident O
has O
happened O
to O
us O
, O
that O
I O
can O
not O
forbear O
recording O
it O
, O
although O
it O
is O
very O
probable O
that O
you O
will O
see O
me O
before O
these O
papers O
can O
come O
into O
your O
possession O
. O
Last O
Monday O
( O
July O
31st O
) O
, O
we O
were O
nearly O
surrounded O
by O
ice O
, O
which O
closed O
in O
the O
ship O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
scarcely O
leaving O
her O
the O
sea-room O
in O
which O
she O
floated O
. O
Our O
situation O
was O
somewhat O
dangerous O
, O
especially O
as O
we O
were O
compassed O
round O
by O
a O
very O
thick O
fog O
. O
We O
accordingly O
lay O
to O
, O
hoping O
that O
some O
change O
would O
take O
place O
in O
the O
atmosphere O
and O
weather O
. O
About O
two O
o'clock O
the O
mist O
cleared O
away O
, O
and O
we O
beheld O
, O
stretched O
out O
in O
every O
direction O
, O
vast O
and O
irregular O
plains O
of O
ice O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
no O
end O
. O
Some O
of O
my O
comrades O
groaned O
, O
and O
my O
own O
mind O
began O
to O
grow O
watchful O
with O
anxious O
thoughts O
, O
when O
a O
strange O
sight O
suddenly O
attracted O
our O
attention O
, O
and O
diverted O
our O
solicitude O
from O
our O
own O
situation O
. O
We O
perceived O
a O
low O
carriage O
, O
fixed O
on O
a O
sledge O
and O
drawn O
by O
dogs O
, O
pass O
on O
towards O
the O
north O
, O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
half O
a O
mile O
: O
a O
being O
which O
had O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
man O
, O
but O
apparently O
of O
gigantic O
stature O
, O
sat O
in O
the O
sledge O
, O
and O
guided O
the O
dogs O
. O
We O
watched O
the O
rapid O
progress O
of O
the O
traveller O
with O
our O
telescopes O
, O
until O
he O
was O
lost O
among O
the O
distant O
inequalities O
of O
the O
ice O
. O
This O
appearance O
excited O
our O
unqualified O
wonder O
. O
We O
were O
, O
as O
we O
believed O
, O
many O
hundred O
miles O
from O
any O
land O
; O
but O
this O
apparition O
seemed O
to O
denote O
that O
it O
was O
not O
, O
in O
reality O
, O
so O
distant O
as O
we O
had O
supposed O
. O
Shut O
in O
, O
however O
, O
by O
ice O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
follow O
his O
track O
, O
which O
we O
had O
observed O
with O
the O
greatest O
attention O
. O
About O
two O
hours O
after O
this O
occurrence O
, O
we O
heard O
the O
ground O
sea O
; O
and O
before O
night O
the O
ice O
broke O
, O
and O
freed O
our O
ship O
. O
We O
, O
however O
, O
lay O
to O
until O
the O
morning O
, O
fearing O
to O
encounter O
in O
the O
dark O
those O
large O
loose O
masses O
which O
float O
about O
after O
the O
breaking O
up O
of O
the O
ice O
. O
I O
profited O
of O
this O
time O
to O
rest O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
, O
however O
, O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
was O
light O
, O
I O
went O
upon O
deck O
, O
and O
found O
all O
the O
sailors O
busy O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
vessel O
, O
apparently O
talking O
to O
some O
one O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
It O
was O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
a O
sledge O
, O
like O
that O
we O
had O
seen O
before O
, O
which O
had O
drifted O
towards O
us O
in O
the O
night O
, O
on O
a O
large O
fragment O
of O
ice O
. O
Only O
one O
dog O
remained O
alive O
; O
but O
there O
was O
a O
human O
being O
within O
it O
, O
whom O
the O
sailors O
were O
persuading O
to O
enter O
the O
vessel O
. O
He O
was O
not O
, O
as O
the O
other O
traveller O
seemed O
to O
be O
, O
a O
savage O
inhabitant O
of O
some O
undiscovered O
island O
, O
but O
an O
European O
. O
When O
I O
appeared O
on O
deck O
, O
the O
master O
said O
, O
" O
Here O
is O
our O
captain O
, O
and O
he O
will O
not O
allow O
you O
to O
perish O
on O
the O
open O
sea O
. O
" O
On O
perceiving O
me O
, O
the O
stranger O
addressed O
me O
in O
English O
, O
although O
with O
a O
foreign O
accent O
. O
" O
Before O
I O
come O
on O
board O
your O
vessel O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
will O
you O
have O
the O
kindness O
to O
inform O
me O
whither O
you O
are O
bound O
? O
" O
You O
may O
conceive O
my O
astonishment O
on O
hearing O
such O
a O
question O
addressed O
to O
me O
from O
a O
man O
on O
the O
brink O
of O
destruction O
, O
and O
to O
whom O
I O
should O
have O
supposed O
that O
my O
vessel O
would O
have O
been O
a O
resource O
which O
he O
would O
not O
have O
exchanged O
for O
the O
most O
precious O
wealth O
the O
earth O
can O
afford O
. O
I O
replied O
, O
however O
, O
that O
we O
were O
on O
a O
voyage O
of O
discovery O
towards O
the O
northern O
pole O
. O
Upon O
hearing O
this O
he O
appeared O
satisfied O
, O
and O
consented O
to O
come O
on O
board O
. O
Good O
God O
! O
Margaret O
, O
if O
you O
had O
seen O
the O
man O
who O
thus O
capitulated O
for O
his O
safety O
, O
your O
surprise O
would O
have O
been O
boundless O
. O
His O
limbs O
were O
nearly O
frozen O
, O
and O
his O
body O
dreadfully O
emaciated O
by O
fatigue O
and O
suffering O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
man O
in O
so O
wretched O
a O
condition O
. O
We O
attempted O
to O
carry O
him O
into O
the O
cabin O
; O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
had O
quitted O
the O
fresh O
air O
, O
he O
fainted O
. O
We O
accordingly O
brought O
him O
back O
to O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
restored O
him O
to O
animation O
by O
rubbing O
him O
with O
brandy O
, O
and O
forcing O
him O
to O
swallow O
a O
small O
quantity O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
showed O
signs O
of O
life O
we O
wrapped O
him O
up O
in O
blankets O
, O
and O
placed O
him O
near O
the O
chimney O
of O
the O
kitchen O
stove O
. O
By O
slow O
degrees O
he O
recovered O
, O
and O
ate O
a O
little O
soup O
, O
which O
restored O
him O
wonderfully O
. O
Two O
days O
passed O
in O
this O
manner O
before O
he O
was O
able O
to O
speak O
; O
and O
I O
often O
feared O
that O
his O
sufferings O
had O
deprived O
him O
of O
understanding O
. O
When O
he O
had O
in O
some O
measure O
recovered O
, O
I O
removed O
him O
to O
my O
own O
cabin O
, O
and O
attended O
on O
him O
as O
much O
as O
my O
duty O
would O
permit O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
a O
more O
interesting O
creature O
: O
his O
eyes O
have O
generally O
an O
expression O
of O
wildness O
, O
and O
even O
madness O
; O
but O
there O
are O
moments O
when O
, O
if O
any O
one O
performs O
an O
act O
of O
kindness O
towards O
him O
, O
or O
does O
him O
any O
the O
most O
trifling O
service O
, O
his O
whole O
countenance O
is O
lighted O
up O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
with O
a O
beam O
of O
benevolence O
and O
sweetness O
that O
I O
never O
saw O
equalled O
. O
But O
he O
is O
generally O
melancholy O
and O
despairing O
; O
and O
sometimes O
he O
gnashes O
his O
teeth O
, O
as O
if O
impatient O
of O
the O
weight O
of O
woes O
that O
oppresses O
him O
. O
When O
my O
guest O
was O
a O
little O
recovered O
, O
I O
had O
great O
trouble O
to O
keep O
off O
the O
men O
, O
who O
wished O
to O
ask O
him O
a O
thousand O
questions O
; O
but O
I O
would O
not O
allow O
him O
to O
be O
tormented O
by O
their O
idle O
curiosity O
, O
in O
a O
state O
of O
body O
and O
mind O
whose O
restoration O
evidently O
depended O
upon O
entire O
repose O
. O
Once O
, O
however O
, O
the O
lieutenant O
asked O
, O
Why O
he O
had O
come O
so O
far O
upon O
the O
ice O
in O
so O
strange O
a O
vehicle O
? O
His O
countenance O
instantly O
assumed O
an O
aspect O
of O
the O
deepest O
gloom O
; O
and O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
To O
seek O
one O
who O
fled O
from O
me O
. O
" O
" O
And O
did O
the O
man O
whom O
you O
pursued O
travel O
in O
the O
same O
fashion O
? O
" O
" O
Yes O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
I O
fancy O
we O
have O
seen O
him O
; O
for O
the O
day O
before O
we O
picked O
you O
up O
, O
we O
saw O
some O
dogs O
drawing O
a O
sledge O
, O
with O
a O
man O
in O
it O
, O
across O
the O
ice O
. O
" O
This O
aroused O
the O
stranger O
's O
attention O
; O
and O
he O
asked O
a O
multitude O
of O
questions O
concerning O
the O
route O
which O
the O
d√¶mon O
, O
as O
he O
called O
him O
, O
had O
pursued O
. O
Soon O
after O
, O
when O
he O
was O
alone O
with O
me O
, O
he O
said O
, O
-- O
" O
I O
have O
, O
doubtless O
, O
excited O
your O
curiosity O
, O
as O
well O
as O
that O
of O
these O
good O
people O
; O
but O
you O
are O
too O
considerate O
to O
make O
enquiries O
. O
" O
" O
Certainly O
; O
it O
would O
indeed O
be O
very O
impertinent O
and O
inhuman O
in O
me O
to O
trouble O
you O
with O
any O
inquisitiveness O
of O
mine O
. O
" O
" O
And O
yet O
you O
rescued O
me O
from O
a O
strange O
and O
perilous O
situation O
; O
you O
have O
benevolently O
restored O
me O
to O
life O
. O
" O
Soon O
after O
this O
he O
enquired O
if O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
breaking O
up O
of O
the O
ice O
had O
destroyed O
the O
other O
sledge O
? O
I O
replied O
, O
that O
I O
could O
not O
answer O
with O
any O
degree O
of O
certainty O
; O
for O
the O
ice O
had O
not O
broken O
until O
near O
midnight O
, O
and O
the O
traveller O
might O
have O
arrived O
at O
a O
place O
of O
safety O
before O
that O
time O
; O
but O
of O
this O
I O
could O
not O
judge O
. O
From O
this O
time O
a O
new O
spirit O
of O
life O
animated O
the O
decaying O
frame O
of O
the O
stranger O
. O
He O
manifested O
the O
greatest O
eagerness O
to O
be O
upon O
deck O
, O
to O
watch O
for O
the O
sledge O
which O
had O
before O
appeared O
; O
but O
I O
have O
persuaded O
him O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
cabin O
, O
for O
he O
is O
far O
too O
weak O
to O
sustain O
the O
rawness O
of O
the O
atmosphere O
. O
I O
have O
promised O
that O
some O
one O
should O
watch O
for O
him O
, O
and O
give O
him O
instant O
notice O
if O
any O
new O
object O
should O
appear O
in O
sight O
. O
Such O
is O
my O
journal O
of O
what O
relates O
to O
this O
strange O
occurrence O
up O
to O
the O
present O
day O
. O
The O
stranger O
has O
gradually O
improved O
in O
health O
, O
but O
is O
very O
silent O
, O
and O
appears O
uneasy O
when O
any O
one O
except O
myself O
enters O
his O
cabin O
. O
Yet O
his O
manners O
are O
so O
conciliating O
and O
gentle O
, O
that O
the O
sailors O
are O
all O
interested O
in O
him O
, O
although O
they O
have O
had O
very O
little O
communication O
with O
him O
. O
For O
my O
own O
part O
, O
I O
begin O
to O
love O
him O
as O
a O
brother O
; O
and O
his O
constant O
and O
deep O
grief O
fills O
me O
with O
sympathy O
and O
compassion O
. O
He O
must O
have O
been O
a O
noble O
creature O
in O
his O
better O
days O
, O
being O
even O
now O
in O
wreck O
so O
attractive O
and O
amiable O
. O
I O
said O
in O
one O
of O
my O
letters O
, O
my O
dear O
Margaret O
, O
that O
I O
should O
find O
no O
friend O
on O
the O
wide O
ocean O
; O
yet O
I O
have O
found O
a O
man O
who O
, O
before O
his O
spirit O
had O
been O
broken O
by O
misery O
, O
I O
should O
have O
been O
happy O
to O
have O
possessed O
as O
the O
brother O
of O
my O
heart O
. O
I O
shall O
continue O
my O
journal O
concerning O
the O
stranger O
at O
intervals O
, O
should O
I O
have O
any O
fresh O
incidents O
to O
record O
. O
August O
13th O
, O
17 O
-- O
. O
My O
affection O
for O
my O
guest O
increases O
every O
day O
. O
He O
excites O
at O
once O
my O
admiration O
and O
my O
pity O
to O
an O
astonishing O
degree O
. O
How O
can O
I O
see O
so O
noble O
a O
creature O
destroyed O
by O
misery O
, O
without O
feeling O
the O
most O
poignant O
grief O
? O
He O
is O
so O
gentle O
, O
yet O
so O
wise O
; O
his O
mind O
is O
so O
cultivated O
; O
and O
when O
he O
speaks O
, O
although O
his O
words O
are O
culled O
with O
the O
choicest O
art O
, O
yet O
they O
flow O
with O
rapidity O
and O
unparalleled O
eloquence O
. O
He O
is O
now O
much O
recovered O
from O
his O
illness O
, O
and O
is O
continually O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
apparently O
watching O
for O
the O
sledge O
that O
preceded O
his O
own O
. O
Yet O
, O
although O
unhappy O
, O
he O
is O
not O
so O
utterly O
occupied O
by O
his O
own O
misery O
, O
but O
that O
he O
interests O
himself O
deeply O
in O
the O
projects O
of O
others O
. O
He O
has O
frequently O
conversed O
with O
me O
on O
mine O
, O
which O
I O
have O
communicated O
to O
him O
without O
disguise O
. O
He O
entered O
attentively O
into O
all O
my O
arguments O
in O
favour O
of O
my O
eventual O
success O
, O
and O
into O
every O
minute O
detail O
of O
the O
measures O
I O
had O
taken O
to O
secure O
it O
. O
I O
was O
easily O
led O
by O
the O
sympathy O
which O
he O
evinced O
, O
to O
use O
the O
language O
of O
my O
heart O
; O
to O
give O
utterance O
to O
the O
burning O
ardour O
of O
my O
soul O
; O
and O
to O
say O
, O
with O
all O
the O
fervour O
that O
warmed O
me O
, O
how O
gladly O
I O
would O
sacrifice O
my O
fortune O
, O
my O
existence O
, O
my O
every O
hope O
, O
to O
the O
furtherance O
of O
my O
enterprise O
. O
One O
man O
's O
life O
or O
death O
were O
but O
a O
small O
price O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
acquirement O
of O
the O
knowledge O
which O
I O
sought O
; O
for O
the O
dominion O
I O
should O
acquire O
and O
transmit O
over O
the O
elemental O
foes O
of O
our O
race O
. O
As O
I O
spoke O
, O
a O
dark O
gloom O
spread O
over O
my O
listener O
's O
countenance O
. O
At O
first O
I O
perceived O
that O
he O
tried O
to O
suppress O
his O
emotion O
; O
he O
placed O
his O
hands O
before O
his O
eyes O
; O
and O
my O
voice O
quivered O
and O
failed O
me O
, O
as O
I O
beheld O
tears O
trickle O
fast O
from O
between O
his O
fingers O
, O
-- O
a O
groan O
burst O
from O
his O
heaving O
breast O
. O
I O
paused O
; O
-- O
at O
length O
he O
spoke O
, O
in O
broken O
accents O
: O
-- O
" O
Unhappy O
man O
! O
Do O
you O
share O
my O
madness O
? O
Have O
you O
drank O
also O
of O
the O
intoxicating O
draught O
? O
Hear O
me O
, O
-- O
let O
me O
reveal O
my O
tale O
, O
and O
you O
will O
dash O
the O
cup O
from O
your O
lips O
! O
" O
Such O
words O
, O
you O
may O
imagine O
, O
strongly O
excited O
my O
curiosity O
; O
but O
the O
paroxysm O
of O
grief O
that O
had O
seized O
the O
stranger O
overcame O
his O
weakened O
powers O
, O
and O
many O
hours O
of O
repose O
and O
tranquil O
conversation O
were O
necessary O
to O
restore O
his O
composure O
. O
Having O
conquered O
the O
violence O
of O
his O
feelings O
, O
he O
appeared O
to O
despise O
himself O
for O
being O
the O
slave O
of O
passion O
; O
and O
quelling O
the O
dark O
tyranny O
of O
despair O
, O
he O
led O
me O
again O
to O
converse O
concerning O
myself O
personally O
. O
He O
asked O
me O
the O
history O
of O
my O
earlier O
years O
. O
The O
tale O
was O
quickly O
told O
: O
but O
it O
awakened O
various O
trains O
of O
reflection O
. O
I O
spoke O
of O
my O
desire O
of O
finding O
a O
friend O
-- O
of O
my O
thirst O
for O
a O
more O
intimate O
sympathy O
with O
a O
fellow O
mind O
than O
had O
ever O
fallen O
to O
my O
lot O
; O
and O
expressed O
my O
conviction O
that O
a O
man O
could O
boast O
of O
little O
happiness O
, O
who O
did O
not O
enjoy O
this O
blessing O
. O
" O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
, O
" O
replied O
the O
stranger O
; O
" O
we O
are O
unfashioned O
creatures O
, O
but O
half O
made O
up O
, O
if O
one O
wiser O
, O
better O
, O
dearer O
than O
ourselves O
-- O
such O
a O
friend O
ought O
to O
be O
-- O
do O
not O
lend O
his O
aid O
to O
perfectionate O
our O
weak O
and O
faulty O
natures O
. O
I O
once O
had O
a O
friend O
, O
the O
most O
noble O
of O
human O
creatures O
, O
and O
am O
entitled O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
judge O
respecting O
friendship O
. O
You O
have O
hope O
, O
and O
the O
world O
before O
you O
, O
and O
have O
no O
cause O
for O
despair O
. O
But O
I O
-- O
I O
have O
lost O
every O
thing O
, O
and O
can O
not O
begin O
life O
anew O
. O
" O
As O
he O
said O
this O
, O
his O
countenance O
became O
expressive O
of O
a O
calm O
settled O
grief O
, O
that O
touched O
me O
to O
the O
heart O
. O
But O
he O
was O
silent O
, O
and O
presently O
retired O
to O
his O
cabin O
. O
Even O
broken O
in O
spirit O
as O
he O
is O
, O
no O
one O
can O
feel O
more O
deeply O
than O
he O
does O
the O
beauties O
of O
nature O
. O
The O
starry O
sky O
, O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
every O
sight O
afforded O
by O
these O
wonderful O
regions O
, O
seems O
still O
to O
have O
the O
power O
of O
elevating O
his O
soul O
from O
earth O
. O
Such O
a O
man O
has O
a O
double O
existence O
: O
he O
may O
suffer O
misery O
, O
and O
be O
overwhelmed O
by O
disappointments O
; O
yet O
, O
when O
he O
has O
retired O
into O
himself O
, O
he O
will O
be O
like O
a O
celestial O
spirit O
, O
that O
has O
a O
halo O
around O
him O
, O
within O
whose O
circle O
no O
grief O
or O
folly O
ventures O
. O
Will O
you O
smile O
at O
the O
enthusiasm O
I O
express O
concerning O
this O
divine O
wanderer O
? O
You O
would O
not O
, O
if O
you O
saw O
him O
. O
You O
have O
been O
tutored O
and O
refined O
by O
books O
and O
retirement O
from O
the O
world O
, O
and O
you O
are O
, O
therefore O
, O
somewhat O
fastidious O
; O
but O
this O
only O
renders O
you O
the O
more O
fit O
to O
appreciate O
the O
extraordinary O
merits O
of O
this O
wonderful O
man O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
discover O
what O
quality O
it O
is O
which O
he O
possesses O
, O
that O
elevates O
him O
so O
immeasurably O
above O
any O
other O
person O
I O
ever O
knew O
. O
I O
believe O
it O
to O
be O
an O
intuitive O
discernment O
; O
a O
quick O
but O
never-failing O
power O
of O
judgment O
; O
a O
penetration O
into O
the O
causes O
of O
things O
, O
unequalled O
for O
clearness O
and O
precision O
; O
add O
to O
this O
a O
facility O
of O
expression O
, O
and O
a O
voice O
whose O
varied O
intonations O
are O
soul-subduing O
music O
. O

Yesterday O
the O
stranger O
said O
to O
me O
, O
" O
You O
may O
easily O
perceive O
, O
Captain O
Walton O
, O
that O
I O
have O
suffered O
great O
and O
unparalleled O
misfortunes O
. O
I O
had O
determined O
, O
at O
one O
time O
, O
that O
the O
memory O
of O
these O
evils O
should O
die O
with O
me O
; O
but O
you O
have O
won O
me O
to O
alter O
my O
determination O
. O
You O
seek O
for O
knowledge O
and O
wisdom O
, O
as O
I O
once O
did O
; O
and O
I O
ardently O
hope O
that O
the O
gratification O
of O
your O
wishes O
may O
not O
be O
a O
serpent O
to O
sting O
you O
, O
as O
mine O
has O
been O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
that O
the O
relation O
of O
my O
disasters O
will O
be O
useful O
to O
you O
; O
yet O
, O
when O
I O
reflect O
that O
you O
are O
pursuing O
the O
same O
course O
, O
exposing O
yourself O
to O
the O
same O
dangers O
which O
have O
rendered O
me O
what O
I O
am O
, O
I O
imagine O
that O
you O
may O
deduce O
an O
apt O
moral O
from O
my O
tale O
; O
one O
that O
may O
direct O
you O
if O
you O
succeed O
in O
your O
undertaking O
, O
and O
console O
you O
in O
case O
of O
failure O
. O
Prepare O
to O
hear O
of O
occurrences O
which O
are O
usually O
deemed O
marvellous O
. O
Were O
we O
among O
the O
tamer O
scenes O
of O
nature O
, O
I O
might O
fear O
to O
encounter O
your O
unbelief O
, O
perhaps O
your O
ridicule O
; O
but O
many O
things O
will O
appear O
possible O
in O
these O
wild O
and O
mysterious O
regions O
, O
which O
would O
provoke O
the O
laughter O
of O
those O
unacquainted O
with O
the O
ever-varied O
powers O
of O
nature O
: O
-- O
nor O
can O
I O
doubt O
but O
that O
my O
tale O
conveys O
in O
its O
series O
internal O
evidence O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
events O
of O
which O
it O
is O
composed O
. O
" O
You O
may O
easily O
imagine O
that O
I O
was O
much O
gratified O
by O
the O
offered O
communication O
; O
yet O
I O
could O
not O
endure O
that O
he O
should O
renew O
his O
grief O
by O
a O
recital O
of O
his O
misfortunes O
. O
I O
felt O
the O
greatest O
eagerness O
to O
hear O
the O
promised O
narrative O
, O
partly O
from O
curiosity O
, O
and O
partly O
from O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
ameliorate O
his O
fate O
, O
if O
it O
were O
in O
my O
power O
. O
I O
expressed O
these O
feelings O
in O
my O
answer O
. O
" O
I O
thank O
you O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
for O
your O
sympathy O
, O
but O
it O
is O
useless O
; O
my O
fate O
is O
nearly O
fulfilled O
. O
I O
wait O
but O
for O
one O
event O
, O
and O
then O
I O
shall O
repose O
in O
peace O
. O
I O
understand O
your O
feeling O
, O
" O
continued O
he O
, O
perceiving O
that O
I O
wished O
to O
interrupt O
him O
; O
" O
but O
you O
are O
mistaken O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
if O
thus O
you O
will O
allow O
me O
to O
name O
you O
; O
nothing O
can O
alter O
my O
destiny O
: O
listen O
to O
my O
history O
, O
and O
you O
will O
perceive O
how O
irrevocably O
it O
is O
determined O
. O
" O
He O
then O
told O
me O
, O
that O
he O
would O
commence O
his O
narrative O
the O
next O
day O
when O
I O
should O
be O
at O
leisure O
. O
This O
promise O
drew O
from O
me O
the O
warmest O
thanks O
. O
I O
have O
resolved O
every O
night O
, O
when O
I O
am O
not O
imperatively O
occupied O
by O
my O
duties O
, O
to O
record O
, O
as O
nearly O
as O
possible O
in O
his O
own O
words O
, O
what O
he O
has O
related O
during O
the O
day O
. O
If O
I O
should O
be O
engaged O
, O
I O
will O
at O
least O
make O
notes O
. O
This O
manuscript O
will O
doubtless O
afford O
you O
the O
greatest O
pleasure O
: O
but O
to O
me O
, O
who O
know O
him O
, O
and O
who O
hear O
it O
from O
his O
own O
lips O
, O
with O
what O
interest O
and O
sympathy O
shall O
I O
read O
it O
in O
some O
future O
day O
! O
Even O
now O
, O
as O
I O
commence O
my O
task O
, O
his O
full-toned O
voice O
swells O
in O
my O
ears O
; O
his O
lustrous O
eyes O
dwell O
on O
me O
with O
all O
their O
melancholy O
sweetness O
; O
I O
see O
his O
thin O
hand O
raised O
in O
animation O
, O
while O
the O
lineaments O
of O
his O
face O
are O
irradiated O
by O
the O
soul O
within O
. O
Strange O
and O
harrowing O
must O
be O
his O
story O
; O
frightful O
the O
storm O
which O
embraced O
the O
gallant O
vessel O
on O
its O
course O
, O
and O
wrecked O
it O
-- O
thus O
! O
