We O
passed O
a O
few O
sad O
hours O
, O
until O
eleven O
o'clock O
, O
when O
the O
trial O
was O
to O
commence O
. O
My O
father O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
family O
being O
obliged O
to O
attend O
as O
witnesses O
, O
I O
accompanied O
them O
to O
the O
court O
. O
During O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
wretched O
mockery O
of O
justice O
I O
suffered O
living O
torture O
. O
It O
was O
to O
be O
decided O
, O
whether O
the O
result O
of O
my O
curiosity O
and O
lawless O
devices O
would O
cause O
the O
death O
of O
two O
of O
my O
fellow-beings O
: O
one O
a O
smiling O
babe O
, O
full O
of O
innocence O
and O
joy O
; O
the O
other O
far O
more O
dreadfully O
murdered O
, O
with O
every O
aggravation O
of O
infamy O
that O
could O
make O
the O
murder O
memorable O
in O
horror O
. O
Justine O
also O
was O
a O
girl O
of O
merit O
, O
and O
possessed O
qualities O
which O
promised O
to O
render O
her O
life O
happy O
: O
now O
all O
was O
to O
be O
obliterated O
in O
an O
ignominious O
grave O
; O
and O
I O
the O
cause O
! O
A O
thousand O
times O
rather O
would O
I O
have O
confessed O
myself O
guilty O
of O
the O
crime O
ascribed O
to O
Justine O
; O
but O
I O
was O
absent O
when O
it O
was O
committed O
, O
and O
such O
a O
declaration O
would O
have O
been O
considered O
as O
the O
ravings O
of O
a O
madman O
, O
and O
would O
not O
have O
exculpated O
her O
who O
suffered O
through O
me O
. O
The O
appearance O
of O
Justine O
was O
calm O
. O
She O
was O
dressed O
in O
mourning O
; O
and O
her O
countenance O
, O
always O
engaging O
, O
was O
rendered O
, O
by O
the O
solemnity O
of O
her O
feelings O
, O
exquisitely O
beautiful O
. O
Yet O
she O
appeared O
confident O
in O
innocence O
, O
and O
did O
not O
tremble O
, O
although O
gazed O
on O
and O
execrated O
by O
thousands O
; O
for O
all O
the O
kindness O
which O
her O
beauty O
might O
otherwise O
have O
excited O
, O
was O
obliterated O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
spectators O
by O
the O
imagination O
of O
the O
enormity O
she O
was O
supposed O
to O
have O
committed O
. O
She O
was O
tranquil O
, O
yet O
her O
tranquillity O
was O
evidently O
constrained O
; O
and O
as O
her O
confusion O
had O
before O
been O
adduced O
as O
a O
proof O
of O
her O
guilt O
, O
she O
worked O
up O
her O
mind O
to O
an O
appearance O
of O
courage O
. O
When O
she O
entered O
the O
court O
, O
she O
threw O
her O
eyes O
round O
it O
, O
and O
quickly O
discovered O
where O
we O
were O
seated O
. O
A O
tear O
seemed O
to O
dim O
her O
eye O
when O
she O
saw O
us O
; O
but O
she O
quickly O
recovered O
herself O
, O
and O
a O
look O
of O
sorrowful O
affection O
seemed O
to O
attest O
her O
utter O
guiltlessness O
. O
The O
trial O
began O
; O
and O
, O
after O
the O
advocate O
against O
her O
had O
stated O
the O
charge O
, O
several O
witnesses O
were O
called O
. O
Several O
strange O
facts O
combined O
against O
her O
, O
which O
might O
have O
staggered O
any O
one O
who O
had O
not O
such O
proof O
of O
her O
innocence O
as O
I O
had O
. O
She O
had O
been O
out O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
night O
on O
which O
the O
murder O
had O
been O
committed O
, O
and O
towards O
morning O
had O
been O
perceived O
by O
a O
market-woman O
not O
far O
from O
the O
spot O
where O
the O
body O
of O
the O
murdered O
child O
had O
been O
afterwards O
found O
. O
The O
woman O
asked O
her O
what O
she O
did O
there O
; O
but O
she O
looked O
very O
strangely O
, O
and O
only O
returned O
a O
confused O
and O
unintelligible O
answer O
. O
She O
returned O
to O
the O
house O
about O
eight O
o'clock O
; O
and O
, O
when O
one O
enquired O
where O
she O
had O
passed O
the O
night O
, O
she O
replied O
that O
she O
had O
been O
looking O
for O
the O
child O
, O
and O
demanded O
earnestly O
if O
any O
thing O
had O
been O
heard O
concerning O
him O
. O
When O
shown O
the O
body O
, O
she O
fell O
into O
violent O
hysterics O
, O
and O
kept O
her O
bed O
for O
several O
days O
. O
The O
picture O
was O
then O
produced O
, O
which O
the O
servant O
had O
found O
in O
her O
pocket O
; O
and O
when O
Elizabeth O
, O
in O
a O
faltering O
voice O
, O
proved O
that O
it O
was O
the O
same O
which O
, O
an O
hour O
before O
the O
child O
had O
been O
missed O
, O
she O
had O
placed O
round O
his O
neck O
, O
a O
murmur O
of O
horror O
and O
indignation O
filled O
the O
court O
. O
Justine O
was O
called O
on O
for O
her O
defence O
. O
As O
the O
trial O
had O
proceeded O
, O
her O
countenance O
had O
altered O
. O
Surprise O
, O
horror O
, O
and O
misery O
were O
strongly O
expressed O
. O
Sometimes O
she O
struggled O
with O
her O
tears O
; O
but O
, O
when O
she O
was O
desired O
to O
plead O
, O
she O
collected O
her O
powers O
, O
and O
spoke O
, O
in O
an O
audible O
, O
although O
variable O
voice O
. O
" O
God O
knows O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
how O
entirely O
I O
am O
innocent O
. O
But O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
that O
my O
protestations O
should O
acquit O
me O
: O
I O
rest O
my O
innocence O
on O
a O
plain O
and O
simple O
explanation O
of O
the O
facts O
which O
have O
been O
adduced O
against O
me O
; O
and O
I O
hope O
the O
character O
I O
have O
always O
borne O
will O
incline O
my O
judges O
to O
a O
favourable O
interpretation O
, O
where O
any O
circumstance O
appears O
doubtful O
or O
suspicious O
. O
" O
She O
then O
related O
that O
, O
by O
the O
permission O
of O
Elizabeth O
, O
she O
had O
passed O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
night O
on O
which O
the O
murder O
had O
been O
committed O
at O
the O
house O
of O
an O
aunt O
at O
ChÃªne O
, O
a O
village O
situated O
at O
about O
a O
league O
from O
Geneva O
. O
On O
her O
return O
, O
at O
about O
nine O
o'clock O
, O
she O
met O
a O
man O
, O
who O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
had O
seen O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
child O
who O
was O
lost O
. O
She O
was O
alarmed O
by O
this O
account O
, O
and O
passed O
several O
hours O
in O
looking O
for O
him O
, O
when O
the O
gates O
of O
Geneva O
were O
shut O
, O
and O
she O
was O
forced O
to O
remain O
several O
hours O
of O
the O
night O
in O
a O
barn O
belonging O
to O
a O
cottage O
, O
being O
unwilling O
to O
call O
up O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
to O
whom O
she O
was O
well O
known O
. O
Most O
of O
the O
night O
she O
spent O
here O
watching O
; O
towards O
morning O
she O
believed O
that O
she O
slept O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
; O
some O
steps O
disturbed O
her O
, O
and O
she O
awoke O
. O
It O
was O
dawn O
, O
and O
she O
quitted O
her O
asylum O
, O
that O
she O
might O
again O
endeavour O
to O
find O
my O
brother O
. O
If O
she O
had O
gone O
near O
the O
spot O
where O
his O
body O
lay O
, O
it O
was O
without O
her O
knowledge O
. O
That O
she O
had O
been O
bewildered O
when O
questioned O
by O
the O
market-woman O
was O
not O
surprising O
, O
since O
she O
had O
passed O
a O
sleepless O
night O
, O
and O
the O
fate O
of O
poor O
William O
was O
yet O
uncertain O
. O
Concerning O
the O
picture O
she O
could O
give O
no O
account O
. O
" O
I O
know O
, O
" O
continued O
the O
unhappy O
victim O
, O
" O
how O
heavily O
and O
fatally O
this O
one O
circumstance O
weighs O
against O
me O
, O
but O
I O
have O
no O
power O
of O
explaining O
it O
; O
and O
when O
I O
have O
expressed O
my O
utter O
ignorance O
, O
I O
am O
only O
left O
to O
conjecture O
concerning O
the O
probabilities O
by O
which O
it O
might O
have O
been O
placed O
in O
my O
pocket O
. O
But O
here O
also O
I O
am O
checked O
. O
I O
believe O
that O
I O
have O
no O
enemy O
on O
earth O
, O
and O
none O
surely O
would O
have O
been O
so O
wicked O
as O
to O
destroy O
me O
wantonly O
. O
Did O
the O
murderer O
place O
it O
there O
? O
I O
know O
of O
no O
opportunity O
afforded O
him O
for O
so O
doing O
; O
or O
, O
if O
I O
had O
, O
why O
should O
he O
have O
stolen O
the O
jewel O
, O
to O
part O
with O
it O
again O
so O
soon O
? O
" O
I O
commit O
my O
cause O
to O
the O
justice O
of O
my O
judges O
, O
yet O
I O
see O
no O
room O
for O
hope O
. O
I O
beg O
permission O
to O
have O
a O
few O
witnesses O
examined O
concerning O
my O
character O
; O
and O
if O
their O
testimony O
shall O
not O
overweigh O
my O
supposed O
guilt O
, O
I O
must O
be O
condemned O
, O
although O
I O
would O
pledge O
my O
salvation O
on O
my O
innocence O
. O
" O
Several O
witnesses O
were O
called O
, O
who O
had O
known O
her O
for O
many O
years O
, O
and O
they O
spoke O
well O
of O
her O
; O
but O
fear O
, O
and O
hatred O
of O
the O
crime O
of O
which O
they O
supposed O
her O
guilty O
, O
rendered O
them O
timorous O
, O
and O
unwilling O
to O
come O
forward O
. O
Elizabeth O
saw O
even O
this O
last O
resource O
, O
her O
excellent O
dispositions O
and O
irreproachable O
conduct O
, O
about O
to O
fail O
the O
accused O
, O
when O
, O
although O
violently O
agitated O
, O
she O
desired O
permission O
to O
address O
the O
court O
. O
" O
I O
am O
, O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
the O
cousin O
of O
the O
unhappy O
child O
who O
was O
murdered O
, O
or O
rather O
his O
sister O
, O
for O
I O
was O
educated O
by O
, O
and O
have O
lived O
with O
his O
parents O
ever O
since O
and O
even O
long O
before O
, O
his O
birth O
. O
It O
may O
therefore O
be O
judged O
indecent O
in O
me O
to O
come O
forward O
on O
this O
occasion O
; O
but O
when O
I O
see O
a O
fellow-creature O
about O
to O
perish O
through O
the O
cowardice O
of O
her O
pretended O
friends O
, O
I O
wish O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
speak O
, O
that O
I O
may O
say O
what O
I O
know O
of O
her O
character O
. O
I O
am O
well O
acquainted O
with O
the O
accused O
. O
I O
have O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
house O
with O
her O
, O
at O
one O
time O
for O
five O
, O
and O
at O
another O
for O
nearly O
two O
years O
. O
During O
all O
that O
period O
she O
appeared O
to O
me O
the O
most O
amiable O
and O
benevolent O
of O
human O
creatures O
. O
She O
nursed O
Madame O
Frankenstein O
, O
my O
aunt O
, O
in O
her O
last O
illness O
, O
with O
the O
greatest O
affection O
and O
care O
; O
and O
afterwards O
attended O
her O
own O
mother O
during O
a O
tedious O
illness O
, O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
excited O
the O
admiration O
of O
all O
who O
knew O
her O
; O
after O
which O
she O
again O
lived O
in O
my O
uncle O
's O
house O
, O
where O
she O
was O
beloved O
by O
all O
the O
family O
. O
She O
was O
warmly O
attached O
to O
the O
child O
who O
is O
now O
dead O
, O
and O
acted O
towards O
him O
like O
a O
most O
affectionate O
mother O
. O
For O
my O
own O
part O
, O
I O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
say O
, O
that O
, O
notwithstanding O
all O
the O
evidence O
produced O
against O
her O
, O
I O
believe O
and O
rely O
on O
her O
perfect O
innocence O
. O
She O
had O
no O
temptation O
for O
such O
an O
action O
: O
as O
to O
the O
bauble O
on O
which O
the O
chief O
proof O
rests O
, O
if O
she O
had O
earnestly O
desired O
it O
, O
I O
should O
have O
willingly O
given O
it O
to O
her O
; O
so O
much O
do O
I O
esteem O
and O
value O
her O
. O
" O
A O
murmur O
of O
approbation O
followed O
Elizabeth O
's O
simple O
and O
powerful O
appeal O
; O
but O
it O
was O
excited O
by O
her O
generous O
interference O
, O
and O
not O
in O
favour O
of O
poor O
Justine O
, O
on O
whom O
the O
public O
indignation O
was O
turned O
with O
renewed O
violence O
, O
charging O
her O
with O
the O
blackest O
ingratitude O
. O
She O
herself O
wept O
as O
Elizabeth O
spoke O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
answer O
. O
My O
own O
agitation O
and O
anguish O
was O
extreme O
during O
the O
whole O
trial O
. O
I O
believed O
in O
her O
innocence O
; O
I O
knew O
it O
. O
Could O
the O
dÃ¦mon O
, O
who O
had O
( O
I O
did O
not O
for O
a O
minute O
doubt O
) O
murdered O
my O
brother O
, O
also O
in O
his O
hellish O
sport O
have O
betrayed O
the O
innocent O
to O
death O
and O
ignominy O
? O
I O
could O
not O
sustain O
the O
horror O
of O
my O
situation O
; O
and O
when O
I O
perceived O
that O
the O
popular O
voice O
, O
and O
the O
countenances O
of O
the O
judges O
, O
had O
already O
condemned O
my O
unhappy O
victim O
, O
I O
rushed O
out O
of O
the O
court O
in O
agony O
. O
The O
tortures O
of O
the O
accused O
did O
not O
equal O
mine O
; O
she O
was O
sustained O
by O
innocence O
, O
but O
the O
fangs O
of O
remorse O
tore O
my O
bosom O
, O
and O
would O
not O
forego O
their O
hold O
. O
I O
passed O
a O
night O
of O
unmingled O
wretchedness O
. O
In O
the O
morning O
I O
went O
to O
the O
court O
; O
my O
lips O
and O
throat O
were O
parched O
. O
I O
dared O
not O
ask O
the O
fatal O
question O
; O
but O
I O
was O
known O
, O
and O
the O
officer O
guessed O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
visit O
. O
The O
ballots O
had O
been O
thrown O
; O
they O
were O
all O
black O
, O
and O
Justine O
was O
condemned O
. O
I O
can O
not O
pretend O
to O
describe O
what O
I O
then O
felt O
. O
I O
had O
before O
experienced O
sensations O
of O
horror O
; O
and O
I O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
bestow O
upon O
them O
adequate O
expressions O
, O
but O
words O
can O
not O
convey O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
heart-sickening O
despair O
that O
I O
then O
endured O
. O
The O
person O
to O
whom O
I O
addressed O
myself O
added O
, O
that O
Justine O
had O
already O
confessed O
her O
guilt O
. O
" O
That O
evidence O
, O
" O
he O
observed O
, O
" O
was O
hardly O
required O
in O
so O
glaring O
a O
case O
, O
but O
I O
am O
glad O
of O
it O
; O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
none O
of O
our O
judges O
like O
to O
condemn O
a O
criminal O
upon O
circumstantial O
evidence O
, O
be O
it O
ever O
so O
decisive O
. O
" O
This O
was O
strange O
and O
unexpected O
intelligence O
; O
what O
could O
it O
mean O
? O
Had O
my O
eyes O
deceived O
me O
? O
and O
was O
I O
really O
as O
mad O
as O
the O
whole O
world O
would O
believe O
me O
to O
be O
, O
if O
I O
disclosed O
the O
object O
of O
my O
suspicions O
? O
I O
hastened O
to O
return O
home O
, O
and O
Elizabeth O
eagerly O
demanded O
the O
result O
. O
" O
My O
cousin O
, O
" O
replied O
I O
, O
" O
it O
is O
decided O
as O
you O
may O
have O
expected O
; O
all O
judges O
had O
rather O
that O
ten O
innocent O
should O
suffer O
, O
than O
that O
one O
guilty O
should O
escape O
. O
But O
she O
has O
confessed O
. O
" O
This O
was O
a O
dire O
blow O
to O
poor O
Elizabeth O
, O
who O
had O
relied O
with O
firmness O
upon O
Justine O
's O
innocence O
. O
" O
Alas O
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
how O
shall O
I O
ever O
again O
believe O
in O
human O
goodness O
? O
Justine O
, O
whom O
I O
loved O
and O
esteemed O
as O
my O
sister O
, O
how O
could O
she O
put O
on O
those O
smiles O
of O
innocence O
only O
to O
betray O
? O
her O
mild O
eyes O
seemed O
incapable O
of O
any O
severity O
or O
guile O
, O
and O
yet O
she O
has O
committed O
a O
murder O
. O
" O
Soon O
after O
we O
heard O
that O
the O
poor O
victim O
had O
expressed O
a O
desire O
to O
see O
my O
cousin O
. O
My O
father O
wished O
her O
not O
to O
go O
; O
but O
said O
, O
that O
he O
left O
it O
to O
her O
own O
judgment O
and O
feelings O
to O
decide O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
I O
will O
go O
, O
although O
she O
is O
guilty O
; O
and O
you O
, O
Victor O
, O
shall O
accompany O
me O
: O
I O
can O
not O
go O
alone O
. O
" O
The O
idea O
of O
this O
visit O
was O
torture O
to O
me O
, O
yet O
I O
could O
not O
refuse O
. O
We O
entered O
the O
gloomy O
prison-chamber O
, O
and O
beheld O
Justine O
sitting O
on O
some O
straw O
at O
the O
farther O
end O
; O
her O
hands O
were O
manacled O
, O
and O
her O
head O
rested O
on O
her O
knees O
. O
She O
rose O
on O
seeing O
us O
enter O
; O
and O
when O
we O
were O
left O
alone O
with O
her O
, O
she O
threw O
herself O
at O
the O
feet O
of O
Elizabeth O
, O
weeping O
bitterly O
. O
My O
cousin O
wept O
also O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
Justine O
! O
" O
said O
she O
, O
" O
why O
did O
you O
rob O
me O
of O
my O
last O
consolation O
? O
I O
relied O
on O
your O
innocence O
; O
and O
although O
I O
was O
then O
very O
wretched O
, O
I O
was O
not O
so O
miserable O
as O
I O
am O
now O
. O
" O
" O
And O
do O
you O
also O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
so O
very O
, O
very O
wicked O
? O
Do O
you O
also O
join O
with O
my O
enemies O
to O
crush O
me O
, O
to O
condemn O
me O
as O
a O
murderer O
? O
" O
Her O
voice O
was O
suffocated O
with O
sobs O
. O
" O
Rise O
, O
my O
poor O
girl O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
, O
" O
why O
do O
you O
kneel O
, O
if O
you O
are O
innocent O
? O
I O
am O
not O
one O
of O
your O
enemies O
; O
I O
believed O
you O
guiltless O
, O
notwithstanding O
every O
evidence O
, O
until O
I O
heard O
that O
you O
had O
yourself O
declared O
your O
guilt O
. O
That O
report O
, O
you O
say O
, O
is O
false O
; O
and O
be O
assured O
, O
dear O
Justine O
, O
that O
nothing O
can O
shake O
my O
confidence O
in O
you O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
but O
your O
own O
confession O
. O
" O
" O
I O
did O
confess O
; O
but O
I O
confessed O
a O
lie O
. O
I O
confessed O
, O
that O
I O
might O
obtain O
absolution O
; O
but O
now O
that O
falsehood O
lies O
heavier O
at O
my O
heart O
than O
all O
my O
other O
sins O
. O
The O
God O
of O
heaven O
forgive O
me O
! O
Ever O
since O
I O
was O
condemned O
, O
my O
confessor O
has O
besieged O
me O
; O
he O
threatened O
and O
menaced O
, O
until O
I O
almost O
began O
to O
think O
that O
I O
was O
the O
monster O
that O
he O
said O
I O
was O
. O
He O
threatened O
excommunication O
and O
hell O
fire O
in O
my O
last O
moments O
, O
if O
I O
continued O
obdurate O
. O
Dear O
lady O
, O
I O
had O
none O
to O
support O
me O
; O
all O
looked O
on O
me O
as O
a O
wretch O
doomed O
to O
ignominy O
and O
perdition O
. O
What O
could O
I O
do O
? O
In O
an O
evil O
hour O
I O
subscribed O
to O
a O
lie O
; O
and O
now O
only O
am O
I O
truly O
miserable O
. O
" O
She O
paused O
, O
weeping O
, O
and O
then O
continued O
-- O
" O
I O
thought O
with O
horror O
, O
my O
sweet O
lady O
, O
that O
you O
should O
believe O
your O
Justine O
, O
whom O
your O
blessed O
aunt O
had O
so O
highly O
honoured O
, O
and O
whom O
you O
loved O
, O
was O
a O
creature O
capable O
of O
a O
crime O
which O
none O
but O
the O
devil O
himself O
could O
have O
perpetrated O
. O
Dear O
William O
! O
dearest O
blessed O
child O
! O
I O
soon O
shall O
see O
you O
again O
in O
heaven O
, O
where O
we O
shall O
all O
be O
happy O
; O
and O
that O
consoles O
me O
, O
going O
as O
I O
am O
to O
suffer O
ignominy O
and O
death O
. O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
Justine O
! O
forgive O
me O
for O
having O
for O
one O
moment O
distrusted O
you O
. O
Why O
did O
you O
confess O
? O
But O
do O
not O
mourn O
, O
dear O
girl O
. O
Do O
not O
fear O
. O
I O
will O
proclaim O
, O
I O
will O
prove O
your O
innocence O
. O
I O
will O
melt O
the O
stony O
hearts O
of O
your O
enemies O
by O
my O
tears O
and O
prayers O
. O
You O
shall O
not O
die O
! O
-- O
You O
, O
my O
play-fellow O
, O
my O
companion O
, O
my O
sister O
, O
perish O
on O
the O
scaffold O
! O
No O
! O
no O
! O
I O
never O
could O
survive O
so O
horrible O
a O
misfortune O
. O
" O
Justine O
shook O
her O
head O
mournfully O
. O
" O
I O
do O
now O
not O
fear O
to O
die O
, O
" O
she O
said O
; O
" O
that O
pang O
is O
past O
. O
God O
raises O
my O
weakness O
, O
and O
gives O
me O
courage O
to O
endure O
the O
worst O
. O
I O
leave O
a O
sad O
and O
bitter O
world O
; O
and O
if O
you O
remember O
me O
, O
and O
think O
of O
me O
as O
of O
one O
unjustly O
condemned O
, O
I O
am O
resigned O
to O
the O
fate O
awaiting O
me O
. O
Learn O
from O
me O
, O
dear O
lady O
, O
to O
submit O
in O
patience O
to O
the O
will O
of O
Heaven O
! O
" O
During O
this O
conversation O
I O
had O
retired O
to O
a O
corner O
of O
the O
prison-room O
, O
where O
I O
could O
conceal O
the O
horrid O
anguish O
that O
possessed O
me O
. O
Despair O
! O
Who O
dared O
talk O
of O
that O
? O
The O
poor O
victim O
, O
who O
on O
the O
morrow O
was O
to O
pass O
the O
awful O
boundary O
between O
life O
and O
death O
, O
felt O
not O
as O
I O
did O
, O
such O
deep O
and O
bitter O
agony O
. O
I O
gnashed O
my O
teeth O
, O
and O
ground O
them O
together O
, O
uttering O
a O
groan O
that O
came O
from O
my O
inmost O
soul O
. O
Justine O
started O
. O
When O
she O
saw O
who O
it O
was O
, O
she O
approached O
me O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Dear O
sir O
, O
you O
are O
very O
kind O
to O
visit O
me O
; O
you O
, O
I O
hope O
, O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
I O
am O
guilty O
? O
" O
I O
could O
not O
answer O
. O
" O
No O
, O
Justine O
, O
" O
said O
Elizabeth O
; O
" O
he O
is O
more O
convinced O
of O
your O
innocence O
than O
I O
was O
; O
for O
even O
when O
he O
heard O
that O
you O
had O
confessed O
, O
he O
did O
not O
credit O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
truly O
thank O
him O
. O
In O
these O
last O
moments O
I O
feel O
the O
sincerest O
gratitude O
towards O
those O
who O
think O
of O
me O
with O
kindness O
. O
How O
sweet O
is O
the O
affection O
of O
others O
to O
such O
a O
wretch O
as O
I O
am O
! O
It O
removes O
more O
than O
half O
my O
misfortune O
; O
and O
I O
feel O
as O
if O
I O
could O
die O
in O
peace O
, O
now O
that O
my O
innocence O
is O
acknowledged O
by O
you O
, O
dear O
lady O
, O
and O
your O
cousin O
. O
" O
Thus O
the O
poor O
sufferer O
tried O
to O
comfort O
others O
and O
herself O
. O
She O
indeed O
gained O
the O
resignation O
she O
desired O
. O
But O
I O
, O
the O
true O
murderer O
, O
felt O
the O
never-dying O
worm O
alive O
in O
my O
bosom O
, O
which O
allowed O
of O
no O
hope O
or O
consolation O
. O
Elizabeth O
also O
wept O
, O
and O
was O
unhappy O
; O
but O
her O
's O
also O
was O
the O
misery O
of O
innocence O
, O
which O
, O
like O
a O
cloud O
that O
passes O
over O
the O
fair O
moon O
, O
for O
a O
while O
hides O
but O
can O
not O
tarnish O
its O
brightness O
. O
Anguish O
and O
despair O
had O
penetrated O
into O
the O
core O
of O
my O
heart O
; O
I O
bore O
a O
hell O
within O
me O
, O
which O
nothing O
could O
extinguish O
. O
We O
stayed O
several O
hours O
with O
Justine O
; O
and O
it O
was O
with O
great O
difficulty O
that O
Elizabeth O
could O
tear O
herself O
away O
. O
" O
I O
wish O
, O
" O
cried O
she O
, O
" O
that O
I O
were O
to O
die O
with O
you O
; O
I O
can O
not O
live O
in O
this O
world O
of O
misery O
. O
" O
Justine O
assumed O
an O
air O
of O
cheerfulness O
, O
while O
she O
with O
difficulty O
repressed O
her O
bitter O
tears O
. O
She O
embraced O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
said O
, O
in O
a O
voice O
of O
half-suppressed O
emotion O
, O
" O
Farewell O
, O
sweet O
lady O
, O
dearest O
Elizabeth O
, O
my O
beloved O
and O
only O
friend O
; O
may O
Heaven O
, O
in O
its O
bounty O
, O
bless O
and O
preserve O
you O
; O
may O
this O
be O
the O
last O
misfortune O
that O
you O
will O
ever O
suffer O
! O
Live O
, O
and O
be O
happy O
, O
and O
make O
others O
so O
. O
" O
And O
on O
the O
morrow O
Justine O
died O
. O
Elizabeth O
's O
heart-rending O
eloquence O
failed O
to O
move O
the O
judges O
from O
their O
settled O
conviction O
in O
the O
criminality O
of O
the O
saintly O
sufferer O
. O
My O
passionate O
and O
indignant O
appeals O
were O
lost O
upon O
them O
. O
And O
when O
I O
received O
their O
cold O
answers O
, O
and O
heard O
the O
harsh O
unfeeling O
reasoning O
of O
these O
men O
, O
my O
purposed O
avowal O
died O
away O
on O
my O
lips O
. O
Thus O
I O
might O
proclaim O
myself O
a O
madman O
, O
but O
not O
revoke O
the O
sentence O
passed O
upon O
my O
wretched O
victim O
. O
She O
perished O
on O
the O
scaffold O
as O
a O
murderess O
! O
From O
the O
tortures O
of O
my O
own O
heart O
, O
I O
turned O
to O
contemplate O
the O
deep O
and O
voiceless O
grief O
of O
my O
Elizabeth O
. O
This O
also O
was O
my O
doing O
! O
And O
my O
father O
's O
woe O
, O
and O
the O
desolation O
of O
that O
late O
so O
smiling O
home O
-- O
all O
was O
the O
work O
of O
my O
thrice-accursed O
hands O
! O
Ye O
weep O
, O
unhappy O
ones O
; O
but O
these O
are O
not O
your O
last O
tears O
! O
Again O
shall O
you O
raise O
the O
funeral O
wail O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
your O
lamentations O
shall O
again O
and O
again O
be O
heard O
! O
Frankenstein O
, O
your O
son O
, O
your O
kinsman O
, O
your O
early O
, O
much-loved O
friend O
; O
he O
who O
would O
spend O
each O
vital O
drop O
of O
blood O
for O
your O
sakes O
-- O
who O
has O
no O
thought O
nor O
sense O
of O
joy O
, O
except O
as O
it O
is O
mirrored O
also O
in O
your O
dear O
countenances O
-- O
who O
would O
fill O
the O
air O
with O
blessings O
, O
and O
spend O
his O
life O
in O
serving O
you O
-- O
he O
bids O
you O
weep O
-- O
to O
shed O
countless O
tears O
; O
happy O
beyond O
his O
hopes O
, O
if O
thus O
inexorable O
fate O
be O
satisfied O
, O
and O
if O
the O
destruction O
pause O
before O
the O
peace O
of O
the O
grave O
have O
succeeded O
to O
your O
sad O
torments O
! O
Thus O
spoke O
my O
prophetic O
soul O
, O
as O
, O
torn O
by O
remorse O
, O
horror O
, O
and O
despair O
, O
I O
beheld O
those O
I O
loved O
spend O
vain O
sorrow O
upon O
the O
graves O
of O
William O
and O
Justine O
, O
the O
first O
hapless O
victims O
to O
my O
unhallowed O
arts O
. O
