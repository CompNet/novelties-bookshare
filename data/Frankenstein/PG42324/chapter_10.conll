Clerval O
then O
put O
the O
following O
letter O
into O
my O
hands O
. O
It O
was O
from O
my O
own O
Elizabeth O
: O
-- O
" O
My O
dearest O
Cousin O
, O
" O
You O
have O
been O
ill O
, O
very O
ill O
, O
and O
even O
the O
constant O
letters O
of O
dear O
kind O
Henry O
are O
not O
sufficient O
to O
reassure O
me O
on O
your O
account O
. O
You O
are O
forbidden O
to O
write O
-- O
to O
hold O
a O
pen O
; O
yet O
one O
word O
from O
you O
, O
dear O
Victor O
, O
is O
necessary O
to O
calm O
our O
apprehensions O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
have O
thought O
that O
each O
post O
would O
bring O
this O
line O
, O
and O
my O
persuasions O
have O
restrained O
my O
uncle O
from O
undertaking O
a O
journey O
to O
Ingolstadt O
. O
I O
have O
prevented O
his O
encountering O
the O
inconveniences O
and O
perhaps O
dangers O
of O
so O
long O
a O
journey O
; O
yet O
how O
often O
have O
I O
regretted O
not O
being O
able O
to O
perform O
it O
myself O
! O
I O
figure O
to O
myself O
that O
the O
task O
of O
attending O
on O
your O
sick O
bed O
has O
devolved O
on O
some O
mercenary O
old O
nurse O
, O
who O
could O
never O
guess O
your O
wishes O
, O
nor O
minister O
to O
them O
with O
the O
care O
and O
affection O
of O
your O
poor O
cousin O
. O
Yet O
that O
is O
over O
now O
: O
Clerval O
writes O
that O
indeed O
you O
are O
getting O
better O
. O
I O
eagerly O
hope O
that O
you O
will O
confirm O
this O
intelligence O
soon O
in O
your O
own O
handwriting O
. O
" O
Get O
well O
-- O
and O
return O
to O
us O
. O
You O
will O
find O
a O
happy O
, O
cheerful O
home O
, O
and O
friends O
who O
love O
you O
dearly O
. O
Your O
father O
's O
health O
is O
vigorous O
, O
and O
he O
asks O
but O
to O
see O
you O
, O
-- O
but O
to O
be O
assured O
that O
you O
are O
well O
; O
and O
not O
a O
care O
will O
ever O
cloud O
his O
benevolent O
countenance O
. O
How O
pleased O
you O
would O
be O
to O
remark O
the O
improvement O
of O
our O
Ernest O
! O
He O
is O
now O
sixteen O
, O
and O
full O
of O
activity O
and O
spirit O
. O
He O
is O
desirous O
to O
be O
a O
true O
Swiss O
, O
and O
to O
enter O
into O
foreign O
service O
; O
but O
we O
can O
not O
part O
with O
him O
, O
at O
least O
until O
his O
elder O
brother O
return O
to O
us O
. O
My O
uncle O
is O
not O
pleased O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
military O
career O
in O
a O
distant O
country O
; O
but O
Ernest O
never O
had O
your O
powers O
of O
application O
. O
He O
looks O
upon O
study O
as O
an O
odious O
fetter O
; O
-- O
his O
time O
is O
spent O
in O
the O
open O
air O
, O
climbing O
the O
hills O
or O
rowing O
on O
the O
lake O
. O
I O
fear O
that O
he O
will O
become O
an O
idler O
, O
unless O
we O
yield O
the O
point O
, O
and O
permit O
him O
to O
enter O
on O
the O
profession O
which O
he O
has O
selected O
. O
" O
Little O
alteration O
, O
except O
the O
growth O
of O
our O
dear O
children O
, O
has O
taken O
place O
since O
you O
left O
us O
. O
The O
blue O
lake O
, O
and O
snow-clad O
mountains O
, O
they O
never O
change O
; O
-- O
and O
I O
think O
our O
placid O
home O
, O
and O
our O
contented O
hearts O
are O
regulated O
by O
the O
same O
immutable O
laws O
. O
My O
trifling O
occupations O
take O
up O
my O
time O
and O
amuse O
me O
, O
and O
I O
am O
rewarded O
for O
any O
exertions O
by O
seeing O
none O
but O
happy O
, O
kind O
faces O
around O
me O
. O
Since O
you O
left O
us O
, O
but O
one O
change O
has O
taken O
place O
in O
our O
little O
household O
. O
Do O
you O
remember O
on O
what O
occasion O
Justine O
Moritz O
entered O
our O
family O
? O
Probably O
you O
do O
not O
; O
I O
will O
relate O
her O
history O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
a O
few O
words O
. O
Madame O
Moritz O
, O
her O
mother O
, O
was O
a O
widow O
with O
four O
children O
, O
of O
whom O
Justine O
was O
the O
third O
. O
This O
girl O
had O
always O
been O
the O
favourite O
of O
her O
father O
; O
but O
, O
through O
a O
strange O
perversity O
, O
her O
mother O
could O
not O
endure O
her O
, O
and O
, O
after O
the O
death O
of O
M O
. O
Moritz O
, O
treated O
her O
very O
ill. O
My O
aunt O
observed O
this O
; O
and O
, O
when O
Justine O
was O
twelve O
years O
of O
age O
, O
prevailed O
on O
her O
mother O
to O
allow O
her O
to O
live O
at O
our O
house O
. O
The O
republican O
institutions O
of O
our O
country O
have O
produced O
simpler O
and O
happier O
manners O
than O
those O
which O
prevail O
in O
the O
great O
monarchies O
that O
surround O
it O
. O
Hence O
there O
is O
less O
distinction O
between O
the O
several O
classes O
of O
its O
inhabitants O
; O
and O
the O
lower O
orders O
, O
being O
neither O
so O
poor O
nor O
so O
despised O
, O
their O
manners O
are O
more O
refined O
and O
moral O
. O
A O
servant O
in O
Geneva O
does O
not O
mean O
the O
same O
thing O
as O
a O
servant O
in O
France O
and O
England O
. O
Justine O
, O
thus O
received O
in O
our O
family O
, O
learned O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
servant O
; O
a O
condition O
which O
, O
in O
our O
fortunate O
country O
, O
does O
not O
include O
the O
idea O
of O
ignorance O
, O
and O
a O
sacrifice O
of O
the O
dignity O
of O
a O
human O
being O
. O
" O
Justine O
, O
you O
may O
remember O
, O
was O
a O
great O
favourite O
of O
yours O
; O
and O
I O
recollect O
you O
once O
remarked O
, O
that O
if O
you O
were O
in O
an O
ill-humour O
, O
one O
glance O
from O
Justine O
could O
dissipate O
it O
, O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
that O
Ariosto O
gives O
concerning O
the O
beauty O
of O
Angelica O
-- O
she O
looked O
so O
frank-hearted O
and O
happy O
. O
My O
aunt O
conceived O
a O
great O
attachment O
for O
her O
, O
by O
which O
she O
was O
induced O
to O
give O
her O
an O
education O
superior O
to O
that O
which O
she O
had O
at O
first O
intended O
. O
This O
benefit O
was O
fully O
repaid O
; O
Justine O
was O
the O
most O
grateful O
little O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
: O
I O
do O
not O
mean O
that O
she O
made O
any O
professions O
; O
I O
never O
heard O
one O
pass O
her O
lips O
; O
but O
you O
could O
see O
by O
her O
eyes O
that O
she O
almost O
adored O
her O
protectress O
. O
Although O
her O
disposition O
was O
gay O
, O
and O
in O
many O
respects O
inconsiderate O
, O
yet O
she O
paid O
the O
greatest O
attention O
to O
every O
gesture O
of O
my O
aunt O
. O
She O
thought O
her O
the O
model O
of O
all O
excellence O
, O
and O
endeavoured O
to O
imitate O
her O
phraseology O
and O
manners O
, O
so O
that O
even O
now O
she O
often O
reminds O
me O
of O
her O
. O
" O
When O
my O
dearest O
aunt O
died O
, O
every O
one O
was O
too O
much O
occupied O
in O
their O
own O
grief O
to O
notice O
poor O
Justine O
, O
who O
had O
attended O
her O
during O
her O
illness O
with O
the O
most O
anxious O
affection O
. O
Poor O
Justine O
was O
very O
ill O
; O
but O
other O
trials O
were O
reserved O
for O
her O
. O
" O
One O
by O
one O
, O
her O
brothers O
and O
sister O
died O
; O
and O
her O
mother O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
her O
neglected O
daughter O
, O
was O
left O
childless O
. O
The O
conscience O
of O
the O
woman O
was O
troubled O
; O
she O
began O
to O
think O
that O
the O
deaths O
of O
her O
favourites O
was O
a O
judgment O
from O
heaven O
to O
chastise O
her O
partiality O
. O
She O
was O
a O
Roman O
catholic O
; O
and O
I O
believe O
her O
confessor O
confirmed O
the O
idea O
which O
she O
had O
conceived O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
a O
few O
months O
after O
your O
departure O
for O
Ingolstadt O
, O
Justine O
was O
called O
home O
by O
her O
repentant O
mother O
. O
Poor O
girl O
! O
she O
wept O
when O
she O
quitted O
our O
house O
; O
she O
was O
much O
altered O
since O
the O
death O
of O
my O
aunt O
; O
grief O
had O
given O
softness O
and O
a O
winning O
mildness O
to O
her O
manners O
, O
which O
had O
before O
been O
remarkable O
for O
vivacity O
. O
Nor O
was O
her O
residence O
at O
her O
mother O
's O
house O
of O
a O
nature O
to O
restore O
her O
gaiety O
. O
The O
poor O
woman O
was O
very O
vacillating O
in O
her O
repentance O
. O
She O
sometimes O
begged O
Justine O
to O
forgive O
her O
unkindness O
, O
but O
much O
oftener O
accused O
her O
of O
having O
caused O
the O
deaths O
of O
her O
brothers O
and O
sister O
. O
Perpetual O
fretting O
at O
length O
threw O
Madame O
Moritz O
into O
a O
decline O
, O
which O
at O
first O
increased O
her O
irritability O
, O
but O
she O
is O
now O
at O
peace O
for O
ever O
. O
She O
died O
on O
the O
first O
approach O
of O
cold O
weather O
, O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
this O
last O
winter O
. O
Justine O
has O
returned O
to O
us O
; O
and O
I O
assure O
you O
I O
love O
her O
tenderly O
. O
She O
is O
very O
clever O
and O
gentle O
, O
and O
extremely O
pretty O
; O
as O
I O
mentioned O
before O
, O
her O
mien O
and O
her O
expressions O
continually O
remind O
me O
of O
my O
dear O
aunt O
. O
" O
I O
must O
say O
also O
a O
few O
words O
to O
you O
, O
my O
dear O
cousin O
, O
of O
little O
darling O
William O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
could O
see O
him O
; O
he O
is O
very O
tall O
of O
his O
age O
, O
with O
sweet O
laughing O
blue O
eyes O
, O
dark O
eyelashes O
, O
and O
curling O
hair O
. O
When O
he O
smiles O
, O
two O
little O
dimples O
appear O
on O
each O
cheek O
, O
which O
are O
rosy O
with O
health O
. O
He O
has O
already O
had O
one O
or O
two O
little O
_wives_ O
, O
but O
Louisa O
Biron O
is O
his O
favourite O
, O
a O
pretty O
little O
girl O
of O
five O
years O
of O
age O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
dear O
Victor O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
you O
wish O
to O
be O
indulged O
in O
a O
little O
gossip O
concerning O
the O
good O
people O
of O
Geneva O
. O
The O
pretty O
Miss O
Mansfield O
has O
already O
received O
the O
congratulatory O
visits O
on O
her O
approaching O
marriage O
with O
a O
young O
Englishman O
, O
John O
Melbourne O
, O
Esq O
. O
Her O
ugly O
sister O
, O
Manon O
, O
married O
M. O
Duvillard O
, O
the O
rich O
banker O
, O
last O
autumn O
. O
Your O
favourite O
schoolfellow O
, O
Louis O
Manoir O
, O
has O
suffered O
several O
misfortunes O
since O
the O
departure O
of O
Clerval O
from O
Geneva O
. O
But O
he O
has O
already O
recovered O
his O
spirits O
, O
and O
is O
reported O
to O
be O
on O
the O
point O
of O
marrying O
a O
very O
lively O
pretty O
Frenchwoman O
, O
Madame O
Tavernier O
. O
She O
is O
a O
widow O
, O
and O
much O
older O
than O
Manoir O
; O
but O
she O
is O
very O
much O
admired O
, O
and O
a O
favourite O
with O
everybody O
. O
" O
I O
have O
written O
myself O
into O
better O
spirits O

my O
anxiety O
returns O
upon O
me O

one O
line O

Dear O
, O
dear O
Elizabeth O
! O
" O
I O
exclaimed O
, O
when O
I O
had O
read O
her O
letter O
, O
" O
I O
will O
write O
instantly O
, O
and O
relieve O
them O
from O
the O
anxiety O
they O
must O
feel O
. O
" O
I O
wrote O
, O
and O
this O
exertion O
greatly O
fatigued O
me O
; O
but O
my O
convalescence O
had O
commenced O
, O
and O
proceeded O
regularly O
. O
In O
another O
fortnight O
I O
was O
able O
to O
leave O
my O
chamber O
. O
One O
of O
my O
first O
duties O
on O
my O
recovery O
was O
to O
introduce O
Clerval O
to O
the O
several O
professors O
of O
the O
university O
. O
In O
doing O
this O
, O
I O
underwent O
a O
kind O
of O
rough O
usage O
, O
ill O
befitting O
the O
wounds O
that O
my O
mind O
had O
sustained O
. O
Ever O
since O
the O
fatal O
night O
, O
the O
end O
of O
my O
labours O
, O
and O
the O
beginning O
of O
my O
misfortunes O
, O
I O
had O
conceived O
a O
violent O
antipathy O
even O
to O
the O
name O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
. O
When O
I O
was O
otherwise O
quite O
restored O
to O
health O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
chemical O
instrument O
would O
renew O
all O
the O
agony O
of O
my O
nervous O
symptoms O
. O
Henry O
saw O
this O
, O
and O
had O
removed O
all O
my O
apparatus O
from O
my O
view O
. O
He O
had O
also O
changed O
my O
apartment O
; O
for O
he O
perceived O
that O
I O
had O
acquired O
a O
dislike O
for O
the O
room O
which O
had O
previously O
been O
my O
laboratory O
. O
But O
these O
cares O
of O
Clerval O
were O
made O
of O
no O
avail O
when O
I O
visited O
the O
professors O
. O
M O
. O
Waldman O
inflicted O
torture O
when O
he O
praised O
, O
with O
kindness O
and O
warmth O
, O
the O
astonishing O
progress O
I O
had O
made O
in O
the O
sciences O
. O
He O
soon O
perceived O
that O
I O
disliked O
the O
subject O
; O
but O
not O
guessing O
the O
real O
cause O
, O
he O
attributed O
my O
feelings O
to O
modesty O
, O
and O
changed O
the O
subject O
from O
my O
improvement O
, O
to O
the O
science O
itself O
, O
with O
a O
desire O
, O
as O
I O
evidently O
saw O
, O
of O
drawing O
me O
out O
. O
What O
could O
I O
do O
? O
He O
meant O
to O
please O
, O
and O
he O
tormented O
me O
. O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
he O
had O
placed O
carefully O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
in O
my O
view O
those O
instruments O
which O
were O
to O
be O
afterwards O
used O
in O
putting O
me O
to O
a O
slow O
and O
cruel O
death O
. O
I O
writhed O
under O
his O
words O
, O
yet O
dared O
not O
exhibit O
the O
pain O
I O
felt O
. O
Clerval O
, O
whose O
eyes O
and O
feelings O
were O
always O
quick O
in O
discerning O
the O
sensations O
of O
others O
, O
declined O
the O
subject O
, O
alleging O
, O
in O
excuse O
, O
his O
total O
ignorance O
; O
and O
the O
conversation O
took O
a O
more O
general O
turn O
. O
I O
thanked O
my O
friend O
from O
my O
heart O
, O
but O
I O
did O
not O
speak O
. O
I O
saw O
plainly O
that O
he O
was O
surprised O
, O
but O
he O
never O
attempted O
to O
draw O
my O
secret O
from O
me O
; O
and O
although O
I O
loved O
him O
with O
a O
mixture O
of O
affection O
and O
reverence O
that O
knew O
no O
bounds O
, O
yet O
I O
could O
never O
persuade O
myself O
to O
confide O
to O
him O
that O
event O
which O
was O
so O
often O
present O
to O
my O
recollection O
, O
but O
which O
I O
feared O
the O
detail O
to O
another O
would O
only O
impress O
more O
deeply O
. O
M. O
Krempe O
was O
not O
equally O
docile O
; O
and O
in O
my O
condition O
at O
that O
time O
, O
of O
almost O
insupportable O
sensitiveness O
, O
his O
harsh O
blunt O
encomiums O
gave O
me O
even O
more O
pain O
than O
the O
benevolent O
approbation O
of O
M. O
Waldman O

A O
youngster O
who O
, O
but O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
believed O
in O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
as O
firmly O
as O
in O
the O
gospel O
, O
has O
now O
set O
himself O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
university O
; O
and O
if O
he O
is O
not O
soon O
pulled O
down O
, O
we O
shall O
all O
be O
out O
of O
countenance. O

M O

Frankenstein O

modest O

an O
excellent O
quality O

young O
man O

Young O
men O
should O
be O
diffident O
of O
themselves O
, O
you O
know O
, O
M. O
Clerval O
: O
I O
was O
myself O
when O
young O
; O
but O
that O
wears O
out O
in O
a O
very O
short O
time O
. O
" O
M. O
Krempe O
had O
now O
commenced O
an O
eulogy O
on O
himself O
, O
which O
happily O
turned O
the O
conversation O
from O
a O
subject O
that O
was O
so O
annoying O
to O
me O
. O
Clerval O
had O
never O
sympathised O
in O
my O
tastes O
for O
natural O
science O
; O
and O
his O
literary O
pursuits O
differed O
wholly O
from O
those O
which O
had O
occupied O
me O
. O
He O
came O
to O
the O
university O
with O
the O
design O
of O
making O
himself O
complete O
master O
of O
the O
oriental O
languages O
, O
as O
thus O
he O
should O
open O
a O
field O
for O
the O
plan O
of O
life O
he O
had O
marked O
out O
for O
himself O
. O
Resolved O
to O
pursue O
no O
inglorious O
career O
, O
he O
turned O
his O
eyes O
toward O
the O
East O
, O
as O
affording O
scope O
for O
his O
spirit O
of O
enterprise O
. O
The O
Persian O
, O
Arabic O
, O
and O
Sanscrit O
languages O
engaged O
his O
attention O
, O
and O
I O
was O
easily O
induced O
to O
enter O
on O
the O
same O
studies O
. O
Idleness O
had O
ever O
been O
irksome O
to O
me O
, O
and O
now O
that O
I O
wished O
to O
fly O
from O
reflection O
, O
and O
hated O
my O
former O
studies O
, O
I O
felt O
great O
relief O
in O
being O
the O
fellow-pupil O
with O
my O
friend O
, O
and O
found O
not O
only O
instruction O
but O
consolation O
in O
the O
works O
of O
the O
orientalists O
. O
I O
did O
not O
, O
like O
him O
, O
attempt O
a O
critical O
knowledge O
of O
their O
dialects O
, O
for O
I O
did O
not O
contemplate O
making O
any O
other O
use O
of O
them O
than O
temporary O
amusement O
. O
I O
read O
merely O
to O
understand O
their O
meaning O
, O
and O
they O
well O
repaid O
my O
labours O
. O
Their O
melancholy O
is O
soothing O
, O
and O
their O
joy O
elevating O
, O
to O
a O
degree O
I O
never O
experienced O
in O
studying O
the O
authors O
of O
any O
other O
country O
. O
When O
you O
read O
their O
writings O
, O
life O
appears O
to O
consist O
in O
a O
warm O
sun O
and O
a O
garden O
of O
roses O
, O
-- O
in O
the O
smiles O
and O
frowns O
of O
a O
fair O
enemy O
, O
and O
the O
fire O
that O
consumes O
your O
own O
heart O
. O
How O
different O
from O
the O
manly O
and O
heroical O
poetry O
of O
Greece O
and O
Rome O
! O
Summer O
passed O
away O
in O
these O
occupations O
, O
and O
my O
return O
to O
Geneva O
was O
fixed O
for O
the O
latter O
end O
of O
autumn O
; O
but O
being O
delayed O
by O
several O
accidents O
, O
winter O
and O
snow O
arrived O
, O
the O
roads O
were O
deemed O
impassable O
, O
and O
my O
journey O
was O
retarded O
until O
the O
ensuing O
spring O
. O
I O
felt O
this O
delay O
very O
bitterly O
; O
for O
I O
longed O
to O
see O
my O
native O
town O
and O
my O
beloved O
friends O
. O
My O
return O
had O
only O
been O
delayed O
so O
long O
, O
from O
an O
unwillingness O
to O
leave O
Clerval O
in O
a O
strange O
place O
, O
before O
he O
had O
become O
acquainted O
with O
any O
of O
its O
inhabitants O
. O
The O
winter O
, O
however O
, O
was O
spent O
cheerfully O
; O
and O
although O
the O
spring O
was O
uncommonly O
late O
, O
when O
it O
came O
its O
beauty O
compensated O
for O
its O
dilatoriness O
. O
The O
month O
of O
May O
had O
already O
commenced O
, O
and O
I O
expected O
the O
letter O
daily O
which O
was O
to O
fix O
the O
date O
of O
my O
departure O
, O
when O
Henry O
proposed O
a O
pedestrian O
tour O
in O
the O
environs O
of O
Ingolstadt O
, O
that O
I O
might O
bid O
a O
personal O
farewell O
to O
the O
country O
I O
had O
so O
long O
inhabited O
. O
I O
acceded O
with O
pleasure O
to O
this O
proposition O
: O
I O
was O
fond O
of O
exercise O
, O
and O
Clerval O
had O
always O
been O
my O
favourite O
companion O
in O
the O
rambles O
of O
this O
nature O
that O
I O
had O
taken O
among O
the O
scenes O
of O
my O
native O
country O
. O
We O
passed O
a O
fortnight O
in O
these O
perambulations O
: O
my O
health O
and O
spirits O
had O
long O
been O
restored O
, O
and O
they O
gained O
additional O
strength O
from O
the O
salubrious O
air O
I O
breathed O
, O
the O
natural O
incidents O
of O
our O
progress O
, O
and O
the O
conversation O
of O
my O
friend O
. O
Study O
had O
before O
secluded O
me O
from O
the O
intercourse O
of O
my O
fellow-creatures O
, O
and O
rendered O
me O
unsocial O
; O
but O
Clerval O
called O
forth O
the O
better O
feelings O
of O
my O
heart O
; O
he O
again O
taught O
me O
to O
love O
the O
aspect O
of O
nature O
, O
and O
the O
cheerful O
faces O
of O
children O
. O
Excellent O
friend O
! O
how O
sincerely O
did O
you O
love O
me O
, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
elevate O
my O
mind O
until O
it O
was O
on O
a O
level O
with O
your O
own O
! O
A O
selfish O
pursuit O
had O
cramped O
and O
narrowed O
me O
, O
until O
your O
gentleness O
and O
affection O
warmed O
and O
opened O
my O
senses O
; O
I O
became O
the O
same O
happy O
creature O
who O
, O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
, O
loved O
and O
beloved O
by O
all O
, O
had O
no O
sorrow O
or O
care O
. O
When O
happy O
, O
inanimate O
nature O
had O
the O
power O
of O
bestowing O
on O
me O
the O
most O
delightful O
sensations O
. O
A O
serene O
sky O
and O
verdant O
fields O
filled O
me O
with O
ecstasy O
. O
The O
present O
season O
was O
indeed O
divine O
; O
the O
flowers O
of O
spring O
bloomed O
in O
the O
hedges O
, O
while O
those O
of O
summer O
were O
already O
in O
bud O
. O
I O
was O
undisturbed O
by O
thoughts O
which O
during O
the O
preceding O
year O
had O
pressed O
upon O
me O
, O
notwithstanding O
my O
endeavours O
to O
throw O
them O
off O
, O
with O
an O
invincible O
burden O
. O
Henry O
rejoiced O
in O
my O
gaiety O
, O
and O
sincerely O
sympathised O
in O
my O
feelings O
: O
he O
exerted O
himself O
to O
amuse O
me O
, O
while O
he O
expressed O
the O
sensations O
that O
filled O
his O
soul O
. O
The O
resources O
of O
his O
mind O
on O
this O
occasion O
were O
truly O
astonishing O
: O
his O
conversation O
was O
full O
of O
imagination O
; O
and O
very O
often O
, O
in O
imitation O
of O
the O
Persian O
and O
Arabic O
writers O
, O
he O
invented O
tales O
of O
wonderful O
fancy O
and O
passion O
. O
At O
other O
times O
he O
repeated O
my O
favourite O
poems O
, O
or O
drew O
me O
out O
into O
arguments O
, O
which O
he O
supported O
with O
great O
ingenuity O
. O
We O
returned O
to O
our O
college O
on O
a O
Sunday O
afternoon O
: O
the O
peasants O
were O
dancing O
, O
and O
every O
one O
we O
met O
appeared O
gay O
and O
happy O
. O
My O
own O
spirits O
were O
high O
, O
and O
I O
bounded O
along O
with O
feelings O
of O
unbridled O
joy O
and O
hilarity O
. O
