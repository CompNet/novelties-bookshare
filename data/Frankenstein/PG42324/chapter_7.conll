When O
I O
had O
attained O
the O
age O
of O
seventeen O
, O
my O
parents O
resolved O
that O
I O
should O
become O
a O
student O
at O
the O
university O
of O
Ingolstadt O
. O
I O
had O
hitherto O
attended O
the O
schools O
of O
Geneva O
; O
but O
my O
father O
thought O
it O
necessary O
, O
for O
the O
completion O
of O
my O
education O
, O
that O
I O
should O
be O
made O
acquainted O
with O
other O
customs O
than O
those O
of O
my O
native O
country O
. O
My O
departure O
was O
therefore O
fixed O
at O
an O
early O
date O
; O
but O
, O
before O
the O
day O
resolved O
upon O
could O
arrive O
, O
the O
first O
misfortune O
of O
my O
life O
occurred O
-- O
an O
omen O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
of O
my O
future O
misery O
. O
Elizabeth O
had O
caught O
the O
scarlet O
fever O
; O
her O
illness O
was O
severe O
, O
and O
she O
was O
in O
the O
greatest O
danger O
. O
During O
her O
illness O
, O
many O
arguments O
had O
been O
urged O
to O
persuade O
my O
mother O
to O
refrain O
from O
attending O
upon O
her O
. O
She O
had O
, O
at O
first O
, O
yielded O
to O
our O
entreaties O
; O
but O
when O
she O
heard O
that O
the O
life O
of O
her O
favourite O
was O
menaced O
, O
she O
could O
no O
longer O
control O
her O
anxiety O
. O
She O
attended O
her O
sick O
bed O
, O
-- O
her O
watchful O
attentions O
triumphed O
over O
the O
malignity O
of O
the O
distemper O
, O
-- O
Elizabeth O
was O
saved O
, O
but O
the O
consequences O
of O
this O
imprudence O
were O
fatal O
to O
her O
preserver O
. O
On O
the O
third O
day O
my O
mother O
sickened O
; O
her O
fever O
was O
accompanied O
by O
the O
most O
alarming O
symptoms O
, O
and O
the O
looks O
of O
her O
medical O
attendants O
prognosticated O
the O
worst O
event O
. O
On O
her O
death-bed O
the O
fortitude O
and O
benignity O
of O
this O
best O
of O
women O
did O
not O
desert O
her O
. O
She O
joined O
the O
hands O
of O
Elizabeth O
and O
myself O
: O
-- O
" O
My O
children O
, O
" O
she O
said O
, O
" O
my O
firmest O
hopes O
of O
future O
happiness O
were O
placed O
on O
the O
prospect O
of O
your O
union O
. O
This O
expectation O
will O
now O
be O
the O
consolation O
of O
your O
father O
. O
Elizabeth O
, O
my O
love O
, O
you O
must O
supply O
my O
place O
to O
my O
younger O
children O
. O
Alas O
! O
I O
regret O
that O
I O
am O
taken O
from O
you O
; O
and O
, O
happy O
and O
beloved O
as O
I O
have O
been O
, O
is O
it O
not O
hard O
to O
quit O
you O
all O
? O
But O
these O
are O
not O
thoughts O
befitting O
me O
; O
I O
will O
endeavour O
to O
resign O
myself O
cheerfully O
to O
death O
, O
and O
will O
indulge O
a O
hope O
of O
meeting O
you O
in O
another O
world O
. O
" O
She O
died O
calmly O
; O
and O
her O
countenance O
expressed O
affection O
even O
in O
death O
. O
I O
need O
not O
describe O
the O
feelings O
of O
those O
whose O
dearest O
ties O
are O
rent O
by O
that O
most O
irreparable O
evil O
; O
the O
void O
that O
presents O
itself O
to O
the O
soul O
; O
and O
the O
despair O
that O
is O
exhibited O
on O
the O
countenance O
. O
It O
is O
so O
long O
before O
the O
mind O
can O
persuade O
itself O
that O
she O
, O
whom O
we O
saw O
every O
day O
, O
and O
whose O
very O
existence O
appeared O
a O
part O
of O
our O
own O
, O
can O
have O
departed O
for O
ever O
-- O
that O
the O
brightness O
of O
a O
beloved O
eye O
can O
have O
been O
extinguished O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
a O
voice O
so O
familiar O
, O
and O
dear O
to O
the O
ear O
, O
can O
be O
hushed O
, O
never O
more O
to O
be O
heard O
. O
These O
are O
the O
reflections O
of O
the O
first O
days O
; O
but O
when O
the O
lapse O
of O
time O
proves O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
evil O
, O
then O
the O
actual O
bitterness O
of O
grief O
commences O
. O
Yet O
from O
whom O
has O
not O
that O
rude O
hand O
rent O
away O
some O
dear O
connection O
? O
and O
why O
should O
I O
describe O
a O
sorrow O
which O
all O
have O
felt O
, O
and O
must O
feel O
? O
The O
time O
at O
length O
arrives O
, O
when O
grief O
is O
rather O
an O
indulgence O
than O
a O
necessity O
; O
and O
the O
smile O
that O
plays O
upon O
the O
lips O
, O
although O
it O
may O
be O
deemed O
a O
sacrilege O
, O
is O
not O
banished O
. O
My O
mother O
was O
dead O
, O
but O
we O
had O
still O
duties O
which O
we O
ought O
to O
perform O
; O
we O
must O
continue O
our O
course O
with O
the O
rest O
, O
and O
learn O
to O
think O
ourselves O
fortunate O
, O
whilst O
one O
remains O
whom O
the O
spoiler O
has O
not O
seized O
. O
My O
departure O
for O
Ingolstadt O
, O
which O
had O
been O
deferred O
by O
these O
events O
, O
was O
now O
again O
determined O
upon O
. O
I O
obtained O
from O
my O
father O
a O
respite O
of O
some O
weeks O
. O
It O
appeared O
to O
me O
sacrilege O
so O
soon O
to O
leave O
the O
repose O
, O
akin O
to O
death O
, O
of O
the O
house O
of O
mourning O
, O
and O
to O
rush O
into O
the O
thick O
of O
life O
. O
I O
was O
new O
to O
sorrow O
, O
but O
it O
did O
not O
the O
less O
alarm O
me O
. O
I O
was O
unwilling O
to O
quit O
the O
sight O
of O
those O
that O
remained O
to O
me O
; O
and O
, O
above O
all O
, O
I O
desired O
to O
see O
my O
sweet O
Elizabeth O
in O
some O
degree O
consoled O
. O
She O
indeed O
veiled O
her O
grief O
, O
and O
strove O
to O
act O
the O
comforter O
to O
us O
all O
. O
She O
looked O
steadily O
on O
life O
, O
and O
assumed O
its O
duties O
with O
courage O
and O
zeal O
. O
She O
devoted O
herself O
to O
those O
whom O
she O
had O
been O
taught O
to O
call O
her O
uncle O
and O
cousins O
. O
Never O
was O
she O
so O
enchanting O
as O
at O
this O
time O
, O
when O
she O
recalled O
the O
sunshine O
of O
her O
smiles O
and O
spent O
them O
upon O
us O
. O
She O
forgot O
even O
her O
own O
regret O
in O
her O
endeavours O
to O
make O
us O
forget O
. O
The O
day O
of O
my O
departure O
at O
length O
arrived O
. O
Clerval O
spent O
the O
last O
evening O
with O
us O
. O
He O
had O
endeavoured O
to O
persuade O
his O
father O
to O
permit O
him O
to O
accompany O
me O
, O
and O
to O
become O
my O
fellow O
student O
; O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
His O
father O
was O
a O
narrow-minded O
trader O
, O
and O
saw O
idleness O
and O
ruin O
in O
the O
aspirations O
and O
ambition O
of O
his O
son O
. O
Henry O
deeply O
felt O
the O
misfortune O
of O
being O
debarred O
from O
a O
liberal O
education O
. O
He O
said O
little O
; O
but O
when O
he O
spoke O
, O
I O
read O
in O
his O
kindling O
eye O
and O
in O
his O
animated O
glance O
a O
restrained O
but O
firm O
resolve O
, O
not O
to O
be O
chained O
to O
the O
miserable O
details O
of O
commerce O
. O
[ O
Illustration O
: O
_The O
day O
of O
my O
departure O
at O
length O
arrived._ O
] O
We O
sat O
late O
. O
We O
could O
not O
tear O
ourselves O
away O
from O
each O
other O
, O
nor O
persuade O
ourselves O
to O
say O
the O
word O
" O
Farewell O
! O
" O
It O
was O
said O
; O
and O
we O
retired O
under O
the O
pretence O
of O
seeking O
repose O
, O
each O
fancying O
that O
the O
other O
was O
deceived O
: O
but O
when O
at O
morning O
's O
dawn O
I O
descended O
to O
the O
carriage O
which O
was O
to O
convey O
me O
away O
, O
they O
were O
all O
there O
-- O
my O
father O
again O
to O
bless O
me O
, O
Clerval O
to O
press O
my O
hand O
once O
more O
, O
my O
Elizabeth O
to O
renew O
her O
entreaties O
that O
I O
would O
write O
often O
, O
and O
to O
bestow O
the O
last O
feminine O
attentions O
on O
her O
playmate O
and O
friend O
. O
I O
threw O
myself O
into O
the O
chaise O
that O
was O
to O
convey O
me O
away O
, O
and O
indulged O
in O
the O
most O
melancholy O
reflections O
. O
I O
, O
who O
had O
ever O
been O
surrounded O
by O
amiable O
companions O
, O
continually O
engaged O
in O
endeavouring O
to O
bestow O
mutual O
pleasure O
, O
I O
was O
now O
alone O
. O
In O
the O
university O
, O
whither O
I O
was O
going O
, O
I O
must O
form O
my O
own O
friends O
, O
and O
be O
my O
own O
protector O
. O
My O
life O
had O
hitherto O
been O
remarkably O
secluded O
and O
domestic O
; O
and O
this O
had O
given O
me O
invincible O
repugnance O
to O
new O
countenances O
. O
I O
loved O
my O
brothers O
, O
Elizabeth O
, O
and O
Clerval O
; O
these O
were O
" O
old O
familiar O
faces O
; O
" O
but O
I O
believed O
myself O
totally O
unfitted O
for O
the O
company O
of O
strangers O
. O
Such O
were O
my O
reflections O
as O
I O
commenced O
my O
journey O
; O
but O
as O
I O
proceeded O
, O
my O
spirits O
and O
hopes O
rose O
. O
I O
ardently O
desired O
the O
acquisition O
of O
knowledge O
. O
I O
had O
often O
, O
when O
at O
home O
, O
thought O
it O
hard O
to O
remain O
during O
my O
youth O
cooped O
up O
in O
one O
place O
, O
and O
had O
longed O
to O
enter O
the O
world O
, O
and O
take O
my O
station O
among O
other O
human O
beings O
. O
Now O
my O
desires O
were O
complied O
with O
, O
and O
it O
would O
, O
indeed O
, O
have O
been O
folly O
to O
repent O
. O
I O
had O
sufficient O
leisure O
for O
these O
and O
many O
other O
reflections O
during O
my O
journey O
to O
Ingolstadt O
, O
which O
was O
long O
and O
fatiguing O
. O
At O
length O
the O
high O
white O
steeple O
of O
the O
town O
met O
my O
eyes O
. O
I O
alighted O
, O
and O
was O
conducted O
to O
my O
solitary O
apartment O
, O
to O
spend O
the O
evening O
as O
I O
pleased O
. O
The O
next O
morning O
I O
delivered O
my O
letters O
of O
introduction O
, O
and O
paid O
a O
visit O
to O
some O
of O
the O
principal O
professors O
. O
Chance O
-- O
or O
rather O
the O
evil O
influence O
, O
the O
Angel O
of O
Destruction O
, O
which O
asserted O
omnipotent O
sway O
over O
me O
from O
the O
moment O
I O
turned O
my O
reluctant O
steps O
from O
my O
father O
's O
door O
-- O
led O
me O
first O
to O
Mr. O
Krempe O
, O
professor O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
. O
He O
was O
an O
uncouth O
man O
, O
but O
deeply O
embued O
in O
the O
secrets O
of O
his O
science O
. O
He O
asked O
me O
several O
questions O
concerning O
my O
progress O
in O
the O
different O
branches O
of O
science O
appertaining O
to O
natural O
philosophy O
. O
I O
replied O
carelessly O
; O
and O
, O
partly O
in O
contempt O
, O
mentioned O
the O
names O
of O
my O
alchymists O
as O
the O
principal O
authors O
I O
had O
studied O
. O
The O
professor O
stared O
: O
" O
Have O
you O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
really O
spent O
your O
time O
in O
studying O
such O
nonsense O
? O
" O
I O
replied O
in O
the O
affirmative O
. O
" O
Every O
minute O
, O
" O
continued O
M. O
Krempe O
with O
warmth O
, O
" O
every O
instant O
that O
you O
have O
wasted O
on O
those O
books O
is O
utterly O
and O
entirely O
lost O
. O
You O
have O
burdened O
your O
memory O
with O
exploded O
systems O
and O
useless O
names O
. O
Good O
God O
! O
in O
what O
desert O
land O
have O
you O
lived O
, O
where O
no O
one O
was O
kind O
enough O
to O
inform O
you O
that O
these O
fancies O
, O
which O
you O
have O
so O
greedily O
imbibed O
, O
are O
a O
thousand O
years O
old O
, O
and O
as O
musty O
as O
they O
are O
ancient O
? O
I O
little O
expected O
, O
in O
this O
enlightened O
and O
scientific O
age O
, O
to O
find O
a O
disciple O
of O
Albertus O
Magnus O
and O
Paracelsus O
. O
My O
dear O
sir O
, O
you O
must O
begin O
your O
studies O
entirely O
anew O
. O
" O
So O
saying O
, O
he O
stept O
aside O
, O
and O
wrote O
down O
a O
list O
of O
several O
books O
treating O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
, O
which O
he O
desired O
me O
to O
procure O
; O
and O
dismissed O
me O
, O
after O
mentioning O
that O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
following O
week O
he O
intended O
to O
commence O
a O
course O
of O
lectures O
upon O
natural O
philosophy O
in O
its O
general O
relations O
, O
and O
that O
M. O
Waldman O
, O
a O
fellow-professor O
, O
would O
lecture O
upon O
chemistry O
the O
alternate O
days O
that O
he O
omitted O
. O
I O
returned O
home O
, O
not O
disappointed O
, O
for O
I O
have O
said O
that O
I O
had O
long O
considered O
those O
authors O
useless O
whom O
the O
professor O
reprobated O
; O
but O
I O
returned O
, O
not O
at O
all O
the O
more O
inclined O
to O
recur O
to O
these O
studies O
in O
any O
shape O
. O
M. O
Krempe O
was O
a O
little O
squat O
man O
, O
with O
a O
gruff O
voice O
and O
a O
repulsive O
countenance O
; O
the O
teacher O
, O
therefore O
, O
did O
not O
prepossess O
me O
in O
favour O
of O
his O
pursuits O
. O
In O
rather O
a O
too O
philosophical O
and O
connected O
a O
strain O
, O
perhaps O
, O
I O
have O
given O
an O
account O
of O
the O
conclusions O
I O
had O
come O
to O
concerning O
them O
in O
my O
early O
years O
. O
As O
a O
child O
, O
I O
had O
not O
been O
content O
with O
the O
results O
promised O
by O
the O
modern O
professors O
of O
natural O
science O
. O
With O
a O
confusion O
of O
ideas O
only O
to O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
my O
extreme O
youth O
, O
and O
my O
want O
of O
a O
guide O
on O
such O
matters O
, O
I O
had O
retrod O
the O
steps O
of O
knowledge O
along O
the O
paths O
of O
time O
, O
and O
exchanged O
the O
discoveries O
of O
recent O
enquirers O
for O
the O
dreams O
of O
forgotten O
alchymists O
. O
Besides O
, O
I O
had O
a O
contempt O
for O
the O
uses O
of O
modern O
natural O
philosophy O
. O
It O
was O
very O
different O
, O
when O
the O
masters O
of O
the O
science O
sought O
immortality O
and O
power O
; O
such O
views O
, O
although O
futile O
, O
were O
grand O
: O
but O
now O
the O
scene O
was O
changed O
. O
The O
ambition O
of O
the O
enquirer O
seemed O
to O
limit O
itself O
to O
the O
annihilation O
of O
those O
visions O
on O
which O
my O
interest O
in O
science O
was O
chiefly O
founded O
. O
I O
was O
required O
to O
exchange O
chimeras O
of O
boundless O
grandeur O
for O
realities O
of O
little O
worth O
. O
Such O
were O
my O
reflections O
during O
the O
first O
two O
or O
three O
days O
of O
my O
residence O
at O
Ingolstadt O
, O
which O
were O
chiefly O
spent O
in O
becoming O
acquainted O
with O
the O
localities O
, O
and O
the O
principal O
residents O
in O
my O
new O
abode O
. O
But O
as O
the O
ensuing O
week O
commenced O
, O
I O
thought O
of O
the O
information O
which O
M. O
Krempe O
had O
given O
me O
concerning O
the O
lectures O
. O
And O
although O
I O
could O
not O
consent O
to O
go O
and O
hear O
that O
little O
conceited O
fellow O
deliver O
sentences O
out O
of O
a O
pulpit O
, O
I O
recollected O
what O
he O
had O
said O
of O
M. O
Waldman O
, O
whom O
I O
had O
never O
seen O
, O
as O
he O
had O
hitherto O
been O
out O
of O
town O
. O
Partly O
from O
curiosity O
, O
and O
partly O
from O
idleness O
, O
I O
went O
into O
the O
lecturing O
room O
, O
which O
M. O
Waldman O
entered O
shortly O
after O
. O
This O
professor O
was O
very O
unlike O
his O
colleague O
. O
He O
appeared O
about O
fifty O
years O
of O
age O
, O
but O
with O
an O
aspect O
expressive O
of O
the O
greatest O
benevolence O
; O
a O
few O
grey O
hairs O
covered O
his O
temples O
, O
but O
those O
at O
the O
back O
of O
his O
head O
were O
nearly O
black O
. O
His O
person O
was O
short O
, O
but O
remarkably O
erect O
; O
and O
his O
voice O
the O
sweetest O
I O
had O
ever O
heard O
. O
He O
began O
his O
lecture O
by O
a O
recapitulation O
of O
the O
history O
of O
chemistry O
, O
and O
the O
various O
improvements O
made O
by O
different O
men O
of O
learning O
, O
pronouncing O
with O
fervour O
the O
names O
of O
the O
most O
distinguished O
discoverers O
. O
He O
then O
took O
a O
cursory O
view O
of O
the O
present O
state O
of O
the O
science O
, O
and O
explained O
many O
of O
its O
elementary O
terms O
. O
After O
having O
made O
a O
few O
preparatory O
experiments O
, O
he O
concluded O
with O
a O
panegyric O
upon O
modern O
chemistry O
, O
the O
terms O
of O
which O
I O
shall O
never O
forget O
: O
-- O
" O
The O
ancient O
teachers O
of O
this O
science O
, O
" O
said O
he O
, O
" O
promised O
impossibilities O
, O
and O
performed O
nothing O
. O
The O
modern O
masters O
promise O
very O
little O
; O
they O
know O
that O
metals O
can O
not O
be O
transmuted O
, O
and O
that O
the O
elixir O
of O
life O
is O
a O
chimera O
. O
But O
these O
philosophers O
, O
whose O
hands O
seem O
only O
made O
to O
dabble O
in O
dirt O
, O
and O
their O
eyes O
to O
pore O
over O
the O
microscope O
or O
crucible O
, O
have O
indeed O
performed O
miracles O
. O
They O
penetrate O
into O
the O
recesses O
of O
nature O
, O
and O
show O
how O
she O
works O
in O
her O
hiding O
places O
. O
They O
ascend O
into O
the O
heavens O
: O
they O
have O
discovered O
how O
the O
blood O
circulates O
, O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
air O
we O
breathe O
. O
They O
have O
acquired O
new O
and O
almost O
unlimited O
powers O
; O
they O
can O
command O
the O
thunders O
of O
heaven O
, O
mimic O
the O
earthquake O
, O
and O
even O
mock O
the O
invisible O
world O
with O
its O
own O
shadows O
. O
" O
Such O
were O
the O
professor O
's O
words O
-- O
rather O
let O
me O
say O
such O
the O
words O
of O
fate O
, O
enounced O
to O
destroy O
me O
. O
As O
he O
went O
on O
, O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
my O
soul O
were O
grappling O
with O
a O
palpable O
enemy O
; O
one O
by O
one O
the O
various O
keys O
were O
touched O
which O
formed O
the O
mechanism O
of O
my O
being O
: O
chord O
after O
chord O
was O
sounded O
, O
and O
soon O
my O
mind O
was O
filled O
with O
one O
thought O
, O
one O
conception O
, O
one O
purpose O
. O
So O
much O
has O
been O
done O
, O
exclaimed O
the O
soul O
of O
Frankenstein O
, O
-- O
more O
, O
far O
more O
, O
will O
I O
achieve O
: O
treading O
in O
the O
steps O
already O
marked O
, O
I O
will O
pioneer O
a O
new O
way O
, O
explore O
unknown O
powers O
, O
and O
unfold O
to O
the O
world O
the O
deepest O
mysteries O
of O
creation O
. O
I O
closed O
not O
my O
eyes O
that O
night O
. O
My O
internal O
being O
was O
in O
a O
state O
of O
insurrection O
and O
turmoil O
; O
I O
felt O
that O
order O
would O
thence O
arise O
, O
but O
I O
had O
no O
power O
to O
produce O
it O
. O
By O
degrees O
, O
after O
the O
morning O
's O
dawn O
, O
sleep O
came O
. O
I O
awoke O
, O
and O
my O
yesternight O
's O
thoughts O
were O
as O
a O
dream O
. O
There O
only O
remained O
a O
resolution O
to O
return O
to O
my O
ancient O
studies O
, O
and O
to O
devote O
myself O
to O
a O
science O
for O
which O
I O
believed O
myself O
to O
possess O
a O
natural O
talent O
. O
On O
the O
same O
day O
, O
I O
paid O
M. O
Waldman O
a O
visit O
. O
His O
manners O
in O
private O
were O
even O
more O
mild O
and O
attractive O
than O
in O
public O
; O
for O
there O
was O
a O
certain O
dignity O
in O
his O
mien O
during O
his O
lecture O
, O
which O
in O
his O
own O
house O
was O
replaced O
by O
the O
greatest O
affability O
and O
kindness O
. O
I O
gave O
him O
pretty O
nearly O
the O
same O
account O
of O
my O
former O
pursuits O
as O
I O
had O
given O
to O
his O
fellow-professor O
. O
He O
heard O
with O
attention O
the O
little O
narration O
concerning O
my O
studies O
, O
and O
smiled O
at O
the O
names O
of O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
and O
Paracelsus O
, O
but O
without O
the O
contempt O
that O
M. O
Krempe O
had O
exhibited O
. O
He O
said O
, O
that O
" O
these O
were O
men O
to O
whose O
indefatigable O
zeal O
modern O
philosophers O
were O
indebted O
for O
most O
of O
the O
foundations O
of O
their O
knowledge O
. O
They O
had O
left O
to O
us O
, O
as O
an O
easier O
task O
, O
to O
give O
new O
names O
, O
and O
arrange O
in O
connected O
classifications O
, O
the O
facts O
which O
they O
in O
a O
great O
degree O
had O
been O
the O
instruments O
of O
bringing O
to O
light O
. O
The O
labours O
of O
men O
of O
genius O
, O
however O
erroneously O
directed O
, O
scarcely O
ever O
fail O
in O
ultimately O
turning O
to O
the O
solid O
advantage O
of O
mankind O
. O
" O
I O
listened O
to O
his O
statement O
, O
which O
was O
delivered O
without O
any O
presumption O
or O
affectation O
; O
and O
then O
added O
, O
that O
his O
lecture O
had O
removed O
my O
prejudices O
against O
modern O
chemists O
; O
I O
expressed O
myself O
in O
measured O
terms O
, O
with O
the O
modesty O
and O
deference O
due O
from O
a O
youth O
to O
his O
instructor O
, O
without O
letting O
escape O
( O
inexperience O
in O
life O
would O
have O
made O
me O
ashamed O
) O
any O
of O
the O
enthusiasm O
which O
stimulated O
my O
intended O
labours O
. O
I O
requested O
his O
advice O
concerning O
the O
books O
I O
ought O
to O
procure O
. O
" O
I O
am O
happy O
, O
" O
said O
M. O
Waldman O
, O
" O
to O
have O
gained O
a O
disciple O
; O
and O
if O
your O
application O
equals O
your O
ability O
, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
of O
your O
success O
. O
Chemistry O
is O
that O
branch O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
in O
which O
the O
greatest O
improvements O
have O
been O
and O
may O
be O
made O
: O
it O
is O
on O
that O
account O
that O
I O
have O
made O
it O
my O
peculiar O
study O
; O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
have O
not O
neglected O
the O
other O
branches O
of O
science O
. O
A O
man O
would O
make O
but O
a O
very O
sorry O
chemist O
if O
he O
attended O
to O
that O
department O
of O
human O
knowledge O
alone O
. O
If O
your O
wish O
is O
to O
become O
really O
a O
man O
of O
science O
, O
and O
not O
merely O
a O
petty O
experimentalist O
, O
I O
should O
advise O
you O
to O
apply O
to O
every O
branch O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
, O
including O
mathematics O
. O
" O
He O
then O
took O
me O
into O
his O
laboratory O
, O
and O
explained O
to O
me O
the O
uses O
of O
his O
various O
machines O
; O
instructing O
me O
as O
to O
what O
I O
ought O
to O
procure O
, O
and O
promising O
me O
the O
use O
of O
his O
own O
when O
I O
should O
have O
advanced O
far O
enough O
in O
the O
science O
not O
to O
derange O
their O
mechanism O
. O
He O
also O
gave O
me O
the O
list O
of O
books O
which O
I O
had O
requested O
; O
and O
I O
took O
my O
leave O
. O
Thus O
ended O
a O
day O
memorable O
to O
me O
: O
it O
decided O
my O
future O
destiny O
. O
