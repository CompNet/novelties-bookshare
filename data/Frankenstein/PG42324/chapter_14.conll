I O
spent O
the O
following O
day O
roaming O
through O
the O
valley O
. O
I O
stood O
beside O
the O
sources O
of O
the O
Arveiron O
, O
which O
take O
their O
rise O
in O
a O
glacier O
, O
that O
with O
slow O
pace O
is O
advancing O
down O
from O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
hills O
, O
to O
barricade O
the O
valley O
. O
The O
abrupt O
sides O
of O
vast O
mountains O
were O
before O
me O
; O
the O
icy O
wall O
of O
the O
glacier O
overhung O
me O
; O
a O
few O
shattered O
pines O
were O
scattered O
around O
; O
and O
the O
solemn O
silence O
of O
this O
glorious O
presence-chamber O
of O
imperial O
Nature O
was O
broken O
only O
by O
the O
brawling O
waves O
, O
or O
the O
fall O
of O
some O
vast O
fragment O
, O
the O
thunder O
sound O
of O
the O
avalanche O
, O
or O
the O
cracking O
, O
reverberated O
along O
the O
mountains O
of O
the O
accumulated O
ice O
, O
which O
, O
through O
the O
silent O
working O
of O
immutable O
laws O
, O
was O
ever O
and O
anon O
rent O
and O
torn O
, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
but O
a O
plaything O
in O
their O
hands O
. O
These O
sublime O
and O
magnificent O
scenes O
afforded O
me O
the O
greatest O
consolation O
that O
I O
was O
capable O
of O
receiving O
. O
They O
elevated O
me O
from O
all O
littleness O
of O
feeling O
; O
and O
although O
they O
did O
not O
remove O
my O
grief O
, O
they O
subdued O
and O
tranquillised O
it O
. O
In O
some O
degree O
, O
also O
, O
they O
diverted O
my O
mind O
from O
the O
thoughts O
over O
which O
it O
had O
brooded O
for O
the O
last O
month O
. O
I O
retired O
to O
rest O
at O
night O
; O
my O
slumbers O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
waited O
on O
and O
ministered O
to O
by O
the O
assemblance O
of O
grand O
shapes O
which O
I O
had O
contemplated O
during O
the O
day O
. O
They O
congregated O
round O
me O
; O
the O
unstained O
snowy O
mountain-top O
, O
the O
glittering O
pinnacle O
, O
the O
pine O
woods O
, O
and O
ragged O
bare O
ravine O
; O
the O
eagle O
, O
soaring O
amidst O
the O
clouds O
-- O
they O
all O
gathered O
round O
me O
, O
and O
bade O
me O
be O
at O
peace O
. O
Where O
had O
they O
fled O
when O
the O
next O
morning O
I O
awoke O
? O
All O
of O
soul-inspiriting O
fled O
with O
sleep O
, O
and O
dark O
melancholy O
clouded O
every O
thought O
. O
The O
rain O
was O
pouring O
in O
torrents O
, O
and O
thick O
mists O
hid O
the O
summits O
of O
the O
mountains O
, O
so O
that O
I O
even O
saw O
not O
the O
faces O
of O
those O
mighty O
friends O
. O
Still O
I O
would O
penetrate O
their O
misty O
veil O
, O
and O
seek O
them O
in O
their O
cloudy O
retreats O
. O
What O
were O
rain O
and O
storm O
to O
me O
? O
My O
mule O
was O
brought O
to O
the O
door O
, O
and O
I O
resolved O
to O
ascend O
to O
the O
summit O
of O
Montanvert O
. O
I O
remembered O
the O
effect O
that O
the O
view O
of O
the O
tremendous O
and O
ever-moving O
glacier O
had O
produced O
upon O
my O
mind O
when O
I O
first O
saw O
it O
. O
It O
had O
then O
filled O
me O
with O
a O
sublime O
ecstasy O
, O
that O
gave O
wings O
to O
the O
soul O
, O
and O
allowed O
it O
to O
soar O
from O
the O
obscure O
world O
to O
light O
and O
joy O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
the O
awful O
and O
majestic O
in O
nature O
had O
indeed O
always O
the O
effect O
of O
solemnising O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
causing O
me O
to O
forget O
the O
passing O
cares O
of O
life O
. O
I O
determined O
to O
go O
without O
a O
guide O
, O
for O
I O
was O
well O
acquainted O
with O
the O
path O
, O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
another O
would O
destroy O
the O
solitary O
grandeur O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
The O
ascent O
is O
precipitous O
, O
but O
the O
path O
is O
cut O
into O
continual O
and O
short O
windings O
, O
which O
enable O
you O
to O
surmount O
the O
perpendicularity O
of O
the O
mountain O
. O
It O
is O
a O
scene O
terrifically O
desolate O
. O
In O
a O
thousand O
spots O
the O
traces O
of O
the O
winter O
avalanche O
may O
be O
perceived O
, O
where O
trees O
lie O
broken O
and O
strewed O
on O
the O
ground O
; O
some O
entirely O
destroyed O
, O
others O
bent O
, O
leaning O
upon O
the O
jutting O
rocks O
of O
the O
mountain O
, O
or O
transversely O
upon O
other O
trees O
. O
The O
path O
, O
as O
you O
ascend O
higher O
, O
is O
intersected O
by O
ravines O
of O
snow O
, O
down O
which O
stones O
continually O
roll O
from O
above O
; O
one O
of O
them O
is O
particularly O
dangerous O
, O
as O
the O
slightest O
sound O
, O
such O
as O
even O
speaking O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
, O
produces O
a O
concussion O
of O
air O
sufficient O
to O
draw O
destruction O
upon O
the O
head O
of O
the O
speaker O
. O
The O
pines O
are O
not O
tall O
or O
luxuriant O
, O
but O
they O
are O
sombre O
, O
and O
add O
an O
air O
of O
severity O
to O
the O
scene O
. O
I O
looked O
on O
the O
valley O
beneath O
; O
vast O
mists O
were O
rising O
from O
the O
rivers O
which O
ran O
through O
it O
, O
and O
curling O
in O
thick O
wreaths O
around O
the O
opposite O
mountains O
, O
whose O
summits O
were O
hid O
in O
the O
uniform O
clouds O
, O
while O
rain O
poured O
from O
the O
dark O
sky O
, O
and O
added O
to O
the O
melancholy O
impression O
I O
received O
from O
the O
objects O
around O
me O
. O
Alas O
! O
why O
does O
man O
boast O
of O
sensibilities O
superior O
to O
those O
apparent O
in O
the O
brute O
; O
it O
only O
renders O
them O
more O
necessary O
beings O
. O
If O
our O
impulses O
were O
confined O
to O
hunger O
, O
thirst O
, O
and O
desire O
, O
we O
might O
be O
nearly O
free O
; O
but O
now O
we O
are O
moved O
by O
every O
wind O
that O
blows O
, O
and O
a O
chance O
word O
or O
scene O
that O
that O
word O
may O
convey O
to O
us O
. O
We O
rest O
; O
a O
dream O
has O
power O
to O
poison O
sleep O
. O
We O
rise O
; O
one O
wand'ring O
thought O
pollutes O
the O
day O
. O
We O
feel O
, O
conceive O
, O
or O
reason O
; O
laugh O
or O
weep O
, O
Embrace O
fond O
woe O
, O
or O
cast O
our O
cares O
away O
; O
It O
is O
the O
same O
: O
for O
, O
be O
it O
joy O
or O
sorrow O
, O
The O
path O
of O
its O
departure O
still O
is O
free O
. O
Man O
's O
yesterday O
may O
ne'er O
be O
like O
his O
morrow O
; O
Nought O
may O
endure O
but O
mutability O
! O
It O
was O
nearly O
noon O
when O
I O
arrived O
at O
the O
top O
of O
the O
ascent O
. O
For O
some O
time O
I O
sat O
upon O
the O
rock O
that O
overlooks O
the O
sea O
of O
ice O
. O
A O
mist O
covered O
both O
that O
and O
the O
surrounding O
mountains O
. O
Presently O
a O
breeze O
dissipated O
the O
cloud O
, O
and O
I O
descended O
upon O
the O
glacier O
. O
The O
surface O
is O
very O
uneven O
, O
rising O
like O
the O
waves O
of O
a O
troubled O
sea O
, O
descending O
low O
, O
and O
interspersed O
by O
rifts O
that O
sink O
deep O
. O
The O
field O
of O
ice O
is O
almost O
a O
league O
in O
width O
, O
but O
I O
spent O
nearly O
two O
hours O
in O
crossing O
it O
. O
The O
opposite O
mountain O
is O
a O
bare O
perpendicular O
rock O
. O
From O
the O
side O
where O
I O
now O
stood O
Montanvert O
was O
exactly O
opposite O
, O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
a O
league O
; O
and O
above O
it O
rose O
Mont O
Blanc O
, O
in O
awful O
majesty O
. O
I O
remained O
in O
a O
recess O
of O
the O
rock O
, O
gazing O
on O
this O
wonderful O
and O
stupendous O
scene O
. O
The O
sea O
, O
or O
rather O
the O
vast O
river O
of O
ice O
, O
wound O
among O
its O
dependent O
mountains O
, O
whose O
aerial O
summits O
hung O
over O
its O
recesses O
. O
Their O
icy O
and O
glittering O
peaks O
shone O
in O
the O
sunlight O
over O
the O
clouds O
. O
My O
heart O
, O
which O
was O
before O
sorrowful O
, O
now O
swelled O
with O
something O
like O
joy O
; O
I O
exclaimed O
-- O
" O
Wandering O
spirits O
, O
if O
indeed O
ye O
wander O
, O
and O
do O
not O
rest O
in O
your O
narrow O
beds O
, O
allow O
me O
this O
faint O
happiness O
, O
or O
take O
me O
, O
as O
your O
companion O
, O
away O
from O
the O
joys O
of O
life O
. O
" O
As O
I O
said O
this O
, O
I O
suddenly O
beheld O
the O
figure O
of O
a O
man O
, O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
advancing O
towards O
me O
with O
superhuman O
speed O
. O
He O
bounded O
over O
the O
crevices O
in O
the O
ice O
, O
among O
which O
I O
had O
walked O
with O
caution O
; O
his O
stature O
, O
also O
, O
as O
he O
approached O
, O
seemed O
to O
exceed O
that O
of O
man O
. O
I O
was O
troubled O
: O
a O
mist O
came O
over O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
I O
felt O
a O
faintness O
seize O
me O
; O
but O
I O
was O
quickly O
restored O
by O
the O
cold O
gale O
of O
the O
mountains O
. O
I O
perceived O
, O
as O
the O
shape O
came O
nearer O
( O
sight O
tremendous O
and O
abhorred O
! O
) O
that O
it O
was O
the O
wretch O
whom O
I O
had O
created O
. O
I O
trembled O
with O
rage O
and O
horror O
, O
resolving O
to O
wait O
his O
approach O
, O
and O
then O
close O
with O
him O
in O
mortal O
combat O
. O
He O
approached O
; O
his O
countenance O
bespoke O
bitter O
anguish O
, O
combined O
with O
disdain O
and O
malignity O
, O
while O
its O
unearthly O
ugliness O
rendered O
it O
almost O
too O
horrible O
for O
human O
eyes O
. O
But O
I O
scarcely O
observed O
this O
; O
rage O
and O
hatred O
had O
at O
first O
deprived O
me O
of O
utterance O
, O
and O
I O
recovered O
only O
to O
overwhelm O
him O
with O
words O
expressive O
of O
furious O
detestation O
and O
contempt O
. O
" O
Devil O
, O
" O
I O
exclaimed O
, O
" O
do O
you O
dare O
approach O
me O
? O
and O
do O
not O
you O
fear O
the O
fierce O
vengeance O
of O
my O
arm O
wreaked O
on O
your O
miserable O
head O
? O
Begone O
, O
vile O
insect O
! O
or O
rather O
, O
stay O
, O
that O
I O
may O
trample O
you O
to O
dust O
! O
and O
, O
oh O
! O
that O
I O
could O
, O
with O
the O
extinction O
of O
your O
miserable O
existence O
, O
restore O
those O
victims O
whom O
you O
have O
so O
diabolically O
murdered O
! O
" O
" O
I O
expected O
this O
reception O
, O
" O
said O
the O
dæmon O
. O
" O
All O
men O
hate O
the O
wretched O
; O
how O
, O
then O
, O
must O
I O
be O
hated O
, O
who O
am O
miserable O
beyond O
all O
living O
things O
! O
Yet O
you O
, O
my O
creator O
, O
detest O
and O
spurn O
me O
, O
thy O
creature O
, O
to O
whom O
thou O
art O
bound O
by O
ties O
only O
dissoluble O
by O
the O
annihilation O
of O
one O
of O
us O
. O
You O
purpose O
to O
kill O
me O
. O
How O
dare O
you O
sport O
thus O
with O
life O
? O
Do O
your O
duty O
towards O
me O
, O
and O
I O
will O
do O
mine O
towards O
you O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
mankind O
. O
If O
you O
will O
comply O
with O
my O
conditions O
, O
I O
will O
leave O
them O
and O
you O
at O
peace O
; O
but O
if O
you O
refuse O
, O
I O
will O
glut O
the O
maw O
of O
death O
, O
until O
it O
be O
satiated O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
your O
remaining O
friends O
. O
" O
" O
Abhorred O
monster O
! O
fiend O
that O
thou O
art O
! O
the O
tortures O
of O
hell O
are O
too O
mild O
a O
vengeance O
for O
thy O
crimes O
. O
Wretched O
devil O
! O
you O
reproach O
me O
with O
your O
creation O
; O
come O
on O
, O
then O
, O
that O
I O
may O
extinguish O
the O
spark O
which O
I O
so O
negligently O
bestowed O
. O
" O
My O
rage O
was O
without O
bounds O
; O
I O
sprang O
on O
him O
, O
impelled O
by O
all O
the O
feelings O
which O
can O
arm O
one O
being O
against O
the O
existence O
of O
another O
. O
He O
easily O
eluded O
me O
, O
and O
said O
-- O
" O
Be O
calm O
! O
I O
entreat O
you O
to O
hear O
me O
, O
before O
you O
give O
vent O
to O
your O
hatred O
on O
my O
devoted O
head O
. O
Have O
I O
not O
suffered O
enough O
, O
that O
you O
seek O
to O
increase O
my O
misery O
? O
Life O
, O
although O
it O
may O
only O
be O
an O
accumulation O
of O
anguish O
, O

dear O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
will O
defend O
it O
. O
Remember O
, O
thou O
hast O
made O
me O
more O
powerful O
than O
thyself O
; O
my O
height O
is O
superior O
to O
thine O
; O
my O
joints O
more O
supple O
. O
But O
I O
will O
not O
be O
tempted O
to O
set O
myself O
in O
opposition O
to O
thee O
. O
I O
am O
thy O
creature O

and O
I O
will O
be O
even O
mild O

docile O
to O
my O
natural O
lord O

king O

thou O
wilt O
also O
perform O
thy O
part O

which O
thou O
owest O
me O

be O
not O
equitable O
to O
every O

upon O
me O
alone O
, O
to O
whom O
thy O
justice O
, O
and O
even O
thy O
clemency O

affection O

is O
most O
due O

Remember O
, O
that O
I O
am O
thy O
creature O

I O
ought O
to O
be O
thy O
Adam O
; O
but O
I O
am O
rather O
the O
fallen O
angel O

whom O
thou O
drivest O
from O
joy O
for O
no O
misdeed O

Every O
where O
I O
see O
bliss O
, O
from O
which O
I O
alone O
am O
irrevocably O
excluded O

I O
was O
benevolent O

good O

misery O

me O
a O
fiend O

me O
happy O

I O
shall O
again O
be O
virtuous O

" O

Begone O

I O
will O
not O
hear O
you O

There O
can O
be O
no O
community O
between O
you O

we O
are O
enemies O

Begone O

let O
us O
try O
our O
strength O
in O
a O
fight O

in O
which O
one O
must O
fall O

" O
" O
How O
can O
I O
move O
thee O
? O
Will O
no O
entreaties O
cause O
thee O
to O
turn O
a O
favourable O
eye O
upon O
thy O
creature O
, O
who O
implores O
thy O
goodness O
and O
compassion O
? O
Believe O
me O
, O
Frankenstein O
: O
I O
was O
benevolent O
; O
my O
soul O
glowed O
with O
love O
and O
humanity O
: O
but O
am O
I O
not O
alone O
, O
miserably O
alone O
? O
You O
, O
my O
creator O
, O
abhor O
me O
; O
what O
hope O
can O
I O
gather O
from O
your O
fellow-creatures O
, O
who O
owe O
me O
nothing O
? O
They O
spurn O
and O
hate O
me O
. O
The O
desert O
mountains O
and O
dreary O
glaciers O
are O
my O
refuge O
. O
I O
have O
wandered O
here O
many O
days O
; O
the O
caves O
of O
ice O
, O
which O
I O
only O
do O
not O
fear O
, O
are O
a O
dwelling O
to O
me O
, O
and O
the O
only O
one O
which O
man O
does O
not O
grudge O
. O
These O
bleak O
skies O
I O
hail O
, O
for O
they O
are O
kinder O
to O
me O
than O
your O
fellow-beings O
. O
If O
the O
multitude O
of O
mankind O
knew O
of O
my O
existence O
, O
they O
would O
do O
as O
you O
do O
, O
and O
arm O
themselves O
for O
my O
destruction O
. O
Shall O
I O
not O
then O
hate O
them O
who O
abhor O
me O
? O
I O
will O
keep O
no O
terms O
with O
my O
enemies O
. O
I O
am O
miserable O
, O
and O
they O
shall O
share O
my O
wretchedness O
. O
Yet O
it O
is O
in O
your O
power O
to O
recompense O
me O
, O
and O
deliver O
them O
from O
an O
evil O
which O
it O
only O
remains O
for O
you O
to O
make O
so O
great O
, O
that O
not O
only O
you O
and O
your O
family O
, O
but O
thousands O
of O
others O
, O
shall O
be O
swallowed O
up O
in O
the O
whirlwinds O
of O
its O
rage O
. O
Let O
your O
compassion O
be O
moved O
, O
and O
do O
not O
disdain O
me O
. O
Listen O
to O
my O
tale O
: O
when O
you O
have O
heard O
that O
, O
abandon O
or O
commiserate O
me O
, O
as O
you O
shall O
judge O
that O
I O
deserve O
. O
But O
hear O
me O
. O
The O
guilty O
are O
allowed O
, O
by O
human O
laws O
, O
bloody O
as O
they O
are O
, O
to O
speak O
in O
their O
own O
defence O
before O
they O
are O
condemned O
. O
Listen O
to O
me O
, O
Frankenstein O
. O
You O
accuse O
me O
of O
murder O
; O
and O
yet O
you O
would O
, O
with O
a O
satisfied O
conscience O
, O
destroy O
your O
own O
creature O
. O
Oh O
, O
praise O
the O
eternal O
justice O
of O
man O
! O
Yet O
I O
ask O
you O
not O
to O
spare O
me O
: O
listen O
to O
me O
; O
and O
then O
, O
if O
you O
can O
, O
and O
if O
you O
will O
, O
destroy O
the O
work O
of O
your O
hands O
. O
" O
" O
Why O
do O
you O
call O
to O
my O
remembrance O
, O
" O
I O
rejoined O
, O
" O
circumstances O
, O
of O
which O
I O
shudder O
to O
reflect O
, O
that O
I O
have O
been O
the O
miserable O
origin O
and O
author O
? O
Cursed O
be O
the O
day O
, O
abhorred O
devil O
, O
in O
which O
you O
first O
saw O
light O
! O
Cursed O
( O
although O
I O
curse O
myself O
) O
be O
the O
hands O
that O
formed O
you O
! O
You O
have O
made O
me O
wretched O
beyond O
expression O
. O
You O
have O
left O
me O
no O
power O
to O
consider O
whether O
I O
am O
just O
to O
you O
, O
or O
not O
. O
Begone O
! O
relieve O
me O
from O
the O
sight O
of O
your O
detested O
form O
. O
" O
" O
Thus O
I O
relieve O
thee O
, O
my O
creator O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
and O
placed O
his O
hated O
hands O
before O
my O
eyes O
, O
which O
I O
flung O
from O
me O
with O
violence O
; O
" O
thus O
I O
take O
from O
thee O
a O
sight O
which O
you O
abhor O
. O
Still O
thou O
canst O
listen O
to O
me O
, O
and O
grant O
me O
thy O
compassion O
. O
By O
the O
virtues O
that O
I O
once O
possessed O
, O
I O
demand O
this O
from O
you O
. O
Hear O
my O
tale O
; O
it O
is O
long O
and O
strange O
, O
and O
the O
temperature O
of O
this O
place O
is O
not O
fitting O
to O
your O
fine O
sensations O
; O
come O
to O
the O
hut O
upon O
the O
mountain O
. O
The O
sun O
is O
yet O
high O
in O
the O
heavens O
; O
before O
it O
descends O
to O
hide O
itself O
behind O
yon O
snowy O
precipices O
, O
and O
illuminate O
another O
world O
, O
you O
will O
have O
heard O
my O
story O
, O
and O
can O
decide O
. O
On O
you O
it O
rests O
, O
whether O
I O
quit O
for O
ever O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
man O
, O
and O
lead O
a O
harmless O
life O
, O
or O
become O
the O
scourge O
of O
your O
fellow-creatures O
, O
and O
the O
author O
of O
your O
own O
speedy O
ruin O
. O
" O
As O
he O
said O
this O
, O
he O
led O
the O
way O
across O
the O
ice O
: O
I O
followed O
. O
My O
heart O
was O
full O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
answer O
him O
; O
but O
, O
as O
I O
proceeded O
, O
I O
weighed O
the O
various O
arguments O
that O
he O
had O
used O
, O
and O
determined O
at O
least O
to O
listen O
to O
his O
tale O
. O
I O
was O
partly O
urged O
by O
curiosity O
, O
and O
compassion O
confirmed O
my O
resolution O
. O
I O
had O
hitherto O
supposed O
him O
to O
be O
the O
murderer O
of O
my O
brother O
, O
and O
I O
eagerly O
sought O
a O
confirmation O
or O
denial O
of O
this O
opinion O
. O
For O
the O
first O
time O
, O
also O
, O
I O
felt O
what O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
creator O
towards O
his O
creature O
were O
, O
and O
that O
I O
ought O
to O
render O
him O
happy O
before O
I O
complained O
of O
his O
wickedness O
. O
These O
motives O
urged O
me O
to O
comply O
with O
his O
demand O
. O
We O
crossed O
the O
ice O
, O
therefore O
, O
and O
ascended O
the O
opposite O
rock O
. O
The O
air O
was O
cold O
, O
and O
the O
rain O
again O
began O
to O
descend O
: O
we O
entered O
the O
hut O
, O
the O
fiend O
with O
an O
air O
of O
exultation O
, O
I O
with O
a O
heavy O
heart O
, O
and O
depressed O
spirits O
. O
But O
I O
consented O
to O
listen O
; O
and O
, O
seating O
myself O
by O
the O
fire O
which O
my O
odious O
companion O
had O
lighted O
, O
he O
thus O
began O
his O
tale O
. O
