" O
Such O
was O
the O
history O
of O
my O
beloved O
cottagers O
. O
It O
impressed O
me O
deeply O
. O
I O
learned O
, O
from O
the O
views O
of O
social O
life O
which O
it O
developed O
, O
to O
admire O
their O
virtues O
, O
and O
to O
deprecate O
the O
vices O
of O
mankind O
. O
" O
As O
yet O
I O
looked O
upon O
crime O
as O
a O
distant O
evil O
; O
benevolence O
and O
generosity O
were O
ever O
present O
before O
me O
, O
inciting O
within O
me O
a O
desire O
to O
become O
an O
actor O
in O
the O
busy O
scene O
where O
so O
many O
admirable O
qualities O
were O
called O
forth O
and O
displayed O
. O
But O
, O
in O
giving O
an O
account O
of O
the O
progress O
of O
my O
intellect O
, O
I O
must O
not O
omit O
a O
circumstance O
which O
occurred O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
month O
of O
August O
of O
the O
same O
year O
. O
" O
One O
night O
, O
during O
my O
accustomed O
visit O
to O
the O
neighbouring O
wood O
, O
where O
I O
collected O
my O
own O
food O
, O
and O
brought O
home O
firing O
for O
my O
protectors O
, O
I O
found O
on O
the O
ground O
a O
leathern O
portmanteau O
, O
containing O
several O
articles O
of O
dress O
and O
some O
books O
. O
I O
eagerly O
seized O
the O
prize O
, O
and O
returned O
with O
it O
to O
my O
hovel O
. O
Fortunately O
the O
books O
were O
written O
in O
the O
language O
, O
the O
elements O
of O
which O
I O
had O
acquired O
at O
the O
cottage O
; O
they O
consisted O
of O
'Paradise O
Lost O
, O
' O
a O
volume O
of O
'Plutarch O
's O
Lives O
, O
' O
and O
the O
'Sorrows O
of O
Werter O
. O
' O
The O
possession O
of O
these O
treasures O
gave O
me O
extreme O
delight O
; O
I O
now O
continually O
studied O
and O
exercised O
my O
mind O
upon O
these O
histories O
, O
whilst O
my O
friends O
were O
employed O
in O
their O
ordinary O
occupations O
. O
" O
I O
can O
hardly O
describe O
to O
you O
the O
effect O
of O
these O
books O
. O
They O
produced O
in O
me O
an O
infinity O
of O
new O
images O
and O
feelings O
, O
that O
sometimes O
raised O
me O
to O
ecstacy O
, O
but O
more O
frequently O
sunk O
me O
into O
the O
lowest O
dejection O
. O
In O
the O
'Sorrows O
of O
Werter O
, O
' O
besides O
the O
interest O
of O
its O
simple O
and O
affecting O
story O
, O
so O
many O
opinions O
are O
canvassed O
, O
and O
so O
many O
lights O
thrown O
upon O
what O
had O
hitherto O
been O
to O
me O
obscure O
subjects O
, O
that O
I O
found O
in O
it O
a O
never-ending O
source O
of O
speculation O
and O
astonishment O
. O
The O
gentle O
and O
domestic O
manners O
it O
described O
, O
combined O
with O
lofty O
sentiments O
and O
feelings O
, O
which O
had O
for O
their O
object O
something O
out O
of O
self O
, O
accorded O
well O
with O
my O
experience O
among O
my O
protectors O
, O
and O
with O
the O
wants O
which O
were O
for O
ever O
alive O
in O
my O
own O
bosom O
. O
But O
I O
thought O
Werter O
himself O
a O
more O
divine O
being O
than O
I O
had O
ever O
beheld O
or O
imagined O
; O
his O
character O
contained O
no O
pretension O
, O
but O
it O
sunk O
deep O
. O
The O
disquisitions O
upon O
death O
and O
suicide O
were O
calculated O
to O
fill O
me O
with O
wonder O
. O
I O
did O
not O
pretend O
to O
enter O
into O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
case O
, O
yet O
I O
inclined O
towards O
the O
opinions O
of O
the O
hero O
, O
whose O
extinction O
I O
wept O
, O
without O
precisely O
understanding O
it O
. O
" O
As O
I O
read O
, O
however O
, O
I O
applied O
much O
personally O
to O
my O
own O
feelings O
and O
condition O
. O
I O
found O
myself O
similar O
, O
yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
strangely O
unlike O
to O
the O
beings O
concerning O
whom O
I O
read O
, O
and O
to O
whose O
conversation O
I O
was O
a O
listener O
. O
I O
sympathised O
with O
, O
and O
partly O
understood O
them O
, O
but O
I O
was O
unformed O
in O
mind O
; O
I O
was O
dependent O
on O
none O
, O
and O
related O
to O
none O
. O
'The O
path O
of O
my O
departure O
was O
free O
; O
' O
and O
there O
was O
none O
to O
lament O
my O
annihilation O
. O
My O
person O
was O
hideous O
, O
and O
my O
stature O
gigantic O
? O
What O
did O
this O
mean O
? O
Who O
was O
I O
? O
What O
was O
I O
? O
Whence O
did O
I O
come O
? O
What O
was O
my O
destination O
? O
These O
questions O
continually O
recurred O
, O
but O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
solve O
them O
. O
" O
The O
volume O
of O
'Plutarch O
's O
Lives O
, O
' O
which O
I O
possessed O
, O
contained O
the O
histories O
of O
the O
first O
founders O
of O
the O
ancient O
republics O
. O
This O
book O
had O
a O
far O
different O
effect O
upon O
me O
from O
the O
'Sorrows O
of O
Werter O
. O
' O
I O
learned O
from O
Werter O
's O
imaginations O
despondency O
and O
gloom O
: O
but O
Plutarch O
taught O
me O
high O
thoughts O
; O
he O
elevated O
me O
above O
the O
wretched O
sphere O
of O
my O
own O
reflections O
, O
to O
admire O
and O
love O
the O
heroes O
of O
past O
ages O
. O
Many O
things O
I O
read O
surpassed O
my O
understanding O
and O
experience O
. O
I O
had O
a O
very O
confused O
knowledge O
of O
kingdoms O
, O
wide O
extents O
of O
country O
, O
mighty O
rivers O
, O
and O
boundless O
seas O
. O
But O
I O
was O
perfectly O
unacquainted O
with O
towns O
, O
and O
large O
assemblages O
of O
men O
. O
The O
cottage O
of O
my O
protectors O
had O
been O
the O
only O
school O
in O
which O
I O
had O
studied O
human O
nature O
; O
but O
this O
book O
developed O
new O
and O
mightier O
scenes O
of O
action O
. O
I O
read O
of O
men O
concerned O
in O
public O
affairs O
, O
governing O
or O
massacring O
their O
species O
. O
I O
felt O
the O
greatest O
ardour O
for O
virtue O
rise O
within O
me O
, O
and O
abhorrence O
for O
vice O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
understood O
the O
signification O
of O
those O
terms O
, O
relative O
as O
they O
were O
, O
as O
I O
applied O
them O
, O
to O
pleasure O
and O
pain O
alone O
. O
Induced O
by O
these O
feelings O
, O
I O
was O
of O
course O
led O
to O
admire O
peaceable O
lawgivers O
, O
Numa O
, O
Solon O
, O
and O
Lycurgus O
, O
in O
preference O
to O
Romulus O
and O
Theseus O
. O
The O
patriarchal O
lives O
of O
my O
protectors O
caused O
these O
impressions O
to O
take O
a O
firm O
hold O
on O
my O
mind O
; O
perhaps O
, O
if O
my O
first O
introduction O
to O
humanity O
had O
been O
made O
by O
a O
young O
soldier O
, O
burning O
for O
glory O
and O
slaughter O
, O
I O
should O
have O
been O
imbued O
with O
different O
sensations O
. O
" O
But O
'Paradise O
Lost O
' O
excited O
different O
and O
far O
deeper O
emotions O
. O
I O
read O
it O
, O
as O
I O
had O
read O
the O
other O
volumes O
which O
had O
fallen O
into O
my O
hands O
, O
as O
a O
true O
history O
. O
It O
moved O
every O
feeling O
of O
wonder O
and O
awe O
, O
that O
the O
picture O
of O
an O
omnipotent O
God O
warring O
with O
his O
creatures O
was O
capable O
of O
exciting O
. O
I O
often O
referred O
the O
several O
situations O
, O
as O
their O
similarity O
struck O
me O
, O
to O
my O
own O
. O
Like O
Adam O
, O
I O
was O
apparently O
united O
by O
no O
link O
to O
any O
other O
being O
in O
existence O
; O
but O
his O
state O
was O
far O
different O
from O
mine O
in O
every O
other O
respect O
. O
He O
had O
come O
forth O
from O
the O
hands O
of O
God O
a O
perfect O
creature O
, O
happy O
and O
prosperous O
, O
guarded O
by O
the O
especial O
care O
of O
his O
Creator O
; O
he O
was O
allowed O
to O
converse O
with O
, O
and O
acquire O
knowledge O
from O
, O
beings O
of O
a O
superior O
nature O
: O
but O
I O
was O
wretched O
, O
helpless O
, O
and O
alone O
. O
Many O
times O
I O
considered O
Satan O
as O
the O
fitter O
emblem O
of O
my O
condition O
; O
for O
often O
, O
like O
him O
, O
when O
I O
viewed O
the O
bliss O
of O
my O
protectors O
, O
the O
bitter O
gall O
of O
envy O
rose O
within O
me O
. O
" O
Another O
circumstance O
strengthened O
and O
confirmed O
these O
feelings O
. O
Soon O
after O
my O
arrival O
in O
the O
hovel O
, O
I O
discovered O
some O
papers O
in O
the O
pocket O
of O
the O
dress O
which O
I O
had O
taken O
from O
your O
laboratory O
. O
At O
first O
I O
had O
neglected O
them O
; O
but O
now O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
decipher O
the O
characters O
in O
which O
they O
were O
written O
, O
I O
began O
to O
study O
them O
with O
diligence O
. O
It O
was O
your O
journal O
of O
the O
four O
months O
that O
preceded O
my O
creation O
. O
You O
minutely O
described O
in O
these O
papers O
every O
step O
you O
took O
in O
the O
progress O
of O
your O
work O
; O
this O
history O
was O
mingled O
with O
accounts O
of O
domestic O
occurrences O
. O
You O
, O
doubtless O
, O
recollect O
these O
papers O
. O
Here O
they O
are O
. O
Every O
thing O
is O
related O
in O
them O
which O
bears O
reference O
to O
my O
accursed O
origin O
; O
the O
whole O
detail O
of O
that O
series O
of O
disgusting O
circumstances O
which O
produced O
it O
, O
is O
set O
in O
view O
; O
the O
minutest O
description O
of O
my O
odious O
and O
loathsome O
person O
is O
given O
, O
in O
language O
which O
painted O
your O
own O
horrors O
, O
and O
rendered O
mine O
indelible O
. O
I O
sickened O
as O
I O
read O
. O
'Hateful O
day O
when O
I O
received O
life O
! O
' O
I O
exclaimed O
in O
agony O
. O
'Accursed O
creator O
! O
Why O
did O
you O
form O
a O
monster O
so O
hideous O
that O
even O
_you_ O
turned O
from O
me O
in O
disgust O
? O
God O
, O
in O
pity O
, O
made O
man O
beautiful O
and O
alluring O
, O
after O
his O
own O
image O
; O
but O
my O
form O
is O
a O
filthy O
type O
of O
yours O
, O
more O
horrid O
even O
from O
the O
very O
resemblance O
. O
Satan O
had O
his O
companions O
, O
fellow-devils O
, O
to O
admire O
and O
encourage O
him O
; O
but O
I O
am O
solitary O
and O
abhorred O
. O
' O
" O
These O
were O
the O
reflections O
of O
my O
hours O
of O
despondency O
and O
solitude O
; O
but O
when O
I O
contemplated O
the O
virtues O
of O
the O
cottagers O
, O
their O
amiable O
and O
benevolent O
dispositions O
, O
I O
persuaded O
myself O
that O
when O
they O
should O
become O
acquainted O
with O
my O
admiration O
of O
their O
virtues O
, O
they O
would O
compassionate O
me O
, O
and O
overlook O
my O
personal O
deformity O
. O
Could O
they O
turn O
from O
their O
door O
one O
, O
however O
monstrous O
, O
who O
solicited O
their O
compassion O
and O
friendship O
? O
I O
resolved O
, O
at O
least O
, O
not O
to O
despair O
, O
but O
in O
every O
way O
to O
fit O
myself O
for O
an O
interview O
with O
them O
which O
would O
decide O
my O
fate O
. O
I O
postponed O
this O
attempt O
for O
some O
months O
longer O
; O
for O
the O
importance O
attached O
to O
its O
success O
inspired O
me O
with O
a O
dread O
lest O
I O
should O
fail O
. O
Besides O
, O
I O
found O
that O
my O
understanding O
improved O
so O
much O
with O
every O
day O
's O
experience O
, O
that O
I O
was O
unwilling O
to O
commence O
this O
undertaking O
until O
a O
few O
more O
months O
should O
have O
added O
to O
my O
sagacity O
. O
" O
Several O
changes O
, O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
, O
took O
place O
in O
the O
cottage O
. O
The O
presence O
of O
Safie O
diffused O
happiness O
among O
its O
inhabitants O
; O
and O
I O
also O
found O
that O
a O
greater O
degree O
of O
plenty O
reigned O
there O
. O
Felix O
and O
Agatha O
spent O
more O
time O
in O
amusement O
and O
conversation O
, O
and O
were O
assisted O
in O
their O
labours O
by O
servants O
. O
They O
did O
not O
appear O
rich O
, O
but O
they O
were O
contented O
and O
happy O
; O
their O
feelings O
were O
serene O
and O
peaceful O
, O
while O
mine O
became O
every O
day O
more O
tumultuous O
. O
Increase O
of O
knowledge O
only O
discovered O
to O
me O
more O
clearly O
what O
a O
wretched O
outcast O
I O
was O
. O
I O
cherished O
hope O
, O
it O
is O
true O
; O
but O
it O
vanished O
, O
when O
I O
beheld O
my O
person O
reflected O
in O
water O
, O
or O
my O
shadow O
in O
the O
moonshine O
, O
even O
as O
that O
frail O
image O
and O
that O
inconstant O
shade O
. O
" O
I O
endeavoured O
to O
crush O
these O
fears O
, O
and O
to O
fortify O
myself O
for O
the O
trial O
which O
in O
a O
few O
months O
I O
resolved O
to O
undergo O
; O
and O
sometimes O
I O
allowed O
my O
thoughts O
, O
unchecked O
by O
reason O
, O
to O
ramble O
in O
the O
fields O
of O
Paradise O
, O
and O
dared O
to O
fancy O
amiable O
and O
lovely O
creatures O
sympathising O
with O
my O
feelings O
, O
and O
cheering O
my O
gloom O
; O
their O
angelic O
countenances O
breathed O
smiles O
of O
consolation O
. O
But O
it O
was O
all O
a O
dream O
; O
no O
Eve O
soothed O
my O
sorrows O
, O
nor O
shared O
my O
thoughts O
; O
I O
was O
alone O
. O
I O
remembered O
Adam O
's O
supplication O
to O
his O
Creator O
. O
But O
where O
was O
mine O
? O
He O
had O
abandoned O
me O
and O
, O
in O
the O
bitterness O
of O
my O
heart O
, O
I O
cursed O
him O
. O
" O
Autumn O
passed O
thus O
. O
I O
saw O
, O
with O
surprise O
and O
grief O
, O
the O
leaves O
decay O
and O
fall O
, O
and O
nature O
again O
assume O
the O
barren O
and O
bleak O
appearance O
it O
had O
worn O
when O
I O
first O
beheld O
the O
woods O
and O
the O
lovely O
moon O
. O
Yet O
I O
did O
not O
heed O
the O
bleakness O
of O
the O
weather O
; O
I O
was O
better O
fitted O
by O
my O
conformation O
for O
the O
endurance O
of O
cold O
than O
heat O
. O
But O
my O
chief O
delights O
were O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
flowers O
, O
the O
birds O
, O
and O
all O
the O
gay O
apparel O
of O
summer O
; O
when O
those O
deserted O
me O
, O
I O
turned O
with O
more O
attention O
towards O
the O
cottagers O
. O
Their O
happiness O
was O
not O
decreased O
by O
the O
absence O
of O
summer O
. O
They O
loved O
, O
and O
sympathised O
with O
one O
another O
; O
and O
their O
joys O
, O
depending O
on O
each O
other O
, O
were O
not O
interrupted O
by O
the O
casualties O
that O
took O
place O
around O
them O
. O
The O
more O
I O
saw O
of O
them O
, O
the O
greater O
became O
my O
desire O
to O
claim O
their O
protection O
and O
kindness O
; O
my O
heart O
yearned O
to O
be O
known O
and O
loved O
by O
these O
amiable O
creatures O
: O
to O
see O
their O
sweet O
looks O
directed O
towards O
me O
with O
affection O
, O
was O
the O
utmost O
limit O
of O
my O
ambition O
. O
I O
dared O
not O
think O
that O
they O
would O
turn O
them O
from O
me O
with O
disdain O
and O
horror O
. O
The O
poor O
that O
stopped O
at O
their O
door O
were O
never O
driven O
away O
. O
I O
asked O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
for O
greater O
treasures O
than O
a O
little O
food O
or O
rest O
: O
I O
required O
kindness O
and O
sympathy O
; O
but O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
myself O
utterly O
unworthy O
of O
it O
. O
" O
The O
winter O
advanced O
, O
and O
an O
entire O
revolution O
of O
the O
seasons O
had O
taken O
place O
since O
I O
awoke O
into O
life O
. O
My O
attention O
, O
at O
this O
time O
, O
was O
solely O
directed O
towards O
my O
plan O
of O
introducing O
myself O
into O
the O
cottage O
of O
my O
protectors O
. O
I O
revolved O
many O
projects O
; O
but O
that O
on O
which O
I O
finally O
fixed O
was O
, O
to O
enter O
the O
dwelling O
when O
the O
blind O
old O
man O
should O
be O
alone O
. O
I O
had O
sagacity O
enough O
to O
discover O
, O
that O
the O
unnatural O
hideousness O
of O
my O
person O
was O
the O
chief O
object O
of O
horror O
with O
those O
who O
had O
formerly O
beheld O
me O
. O
My O
voice O
, O
although O
harsh O
, O
had O
nothing O
terrible O
in O
it O
; O
I O
thought O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
if O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
his O
children O
, O
I O
could O
gain O
the O
good-will O
and O
mediation O
of O
the O
old O
De O
Lacey O
, O
I O
might O
, O
by O
his O
means O
, O
be O
tolerated O
by O
my O
younger O
protectors O
. O
" O
One O
day O
, O
when O
the O
sun O
shone O
on O
the O
red O
leaves O
that O
strewed O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
diffused O
cheerfulness O
, O
although O
it O
denied O
warmth O
, O
Safie O
, O
Agatha O
, O
and O
Felix O
departed O
on O
a O
long O
country O
walk O
, O
and O
the O
old O
man O
, O
at O
his O
own O
desire O
, O
was O
left O
alone O
in O
the O
cottage O
. O
When O
his O
children O
had O
departed O
, O
he O
took O
up O
his O
guitar O
, O
and O
played O
several O
mournful O
but O
sweet O
airs O
, O
more O
sweet O
and O
mournful O
than O
I O
had O
ever O
heard O
him O
play O
before O
. O
At O
first O
his O
countenance O
was O
illuminated O
with O
pleasure O
, O
but O
, O
as O
he O
continued O
, O
thoughtfulness O
and O
sadness O
succeeded O
; O
at O
length O
, O
laying O
aside O
the O
instrument O
, O
he O
sat O
absorbed O
in O
reflection O
. O
" O
My O
heart O
beat O
quick O
; O
this O
was O
the O
hour O
and O
moment O
of O
trial O
, O
which O
would O
decide O
my O
hopes O
, O
or O
realise O
my O
fears O
. O
The O
servants O
were O
gone O
to O
a O
neighbouring O
fair O
. O
All O
was O
silent O
in O
and O
around O
the O
cottage O
: O
it O
was O
an O
excellent O
opportunity O
; O
yet O
, O
when O
I O
proceeded O
to O
execute O
my O
plan O
, O
my O
limbs O
failed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
sank O
to O
the O
ground O
. O
Again O
I O
rose O
; O
and O
, O
exerting O
all O
the O
firmness O
of O
which O
I O
was O
master O
, O
removed O
the O
planks O
which O
I O
had O
placed O
before O
my O
hovel O
to O
conceal O
my O
retreat O
. O
The O
fresh O
air O
revived O
me O
, O
and O
, O
with O
renewed O
determination O
, O
I O
approached O
the O
door O
of O
their O
cottage O
. O
" O
I O
knocked O
. O
'Who O
is O
there O
? O
' O
said O
the O
old O
man O
-- O
'Come O
in O
. O
' O
" O
I O
entered O
; O
'Pardon O
this O
intrusion O
, O
' O
said O
I O
: O
' O
I O
am O
a O
traveller O
in O
want O
of O
a O
little O
rest O
; O
you O
would O
greatly O
oblige O
me O
, O
if O
you O
would O
allow O
me O
to O
remain O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
the O
fire O
. O
' O
" O
'Enter O
, O
' O
said O
De O
Lacey O
; O
'and O
I O
will O
try O
in O
what O
manner O
I O
can O
relieve O
your O
wants O
; O
but O
, O
unfortunately O
, O
my O
children O
are O
from O
home O
, O
and O
, O
as O
I O
am O
blind O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
shall O
find O
it O
difficult O
to O
procure O
food O
for O
you O

' O
" O
'Do O
not O
trouble O
yourself O
, O

only O
that O
I O
need O
. O
' O
" O
I O
sat O
down O
, O
and O
a O
silence O
ensued O
. O
I O
knew O
that O
every O
minute O
was O
precious O
to O
me O
, O
yet O
I O
remained O
irresolute O
in O
what O
manner O
to O
commence O
the O
interview O
; O
when O
the O
old O
man O
addressed O
me O
-- O
" O
'By O
your O
language O
, O
stranger O
, O
I O
suppose O
you O
are O
my O
countryman O
; O
-- O
are O
you O
French O
? O
' O
" O
'No O
; O
but O
I O
was O
educated O
by O
a O
French O
family O
, O
and O

that O
language O
only O
. O
I O
am O
now O
going O
to O
claim O
the O
protection O
of O
some O
friends O
, O
whom O
I O
sincerely O
love O
, O
and O
of O
whose O
favour O
I O
have O
some O
hopes O

' O
" O
'Are O
they O
Germans O
? O
' O
" O
'No O
, O
they O
are O
French O

But O
let O
us O
change O
the O
subject O
. O
I O
am O
an O
unfortunate O
and O
deserted O
creature O
; O
I O
look O
around O
, O
and O
I O
have O
no O
relation O
or O
friend O
upon O
earth O
. O
These O
amiable O
people O
to O
whom O
I O
go O
have O
never O
seen O
me O
, O
and O
know O
little O
of O
me O

I O
am O
full O
of O
fears O
; O
for O
if O
I O
fail O
there O
, O
I O
am O
an O
outcast O
in O
the O
world O
for O
ever O
. O
' O
" O
'Do O
not O
despair O

To O
be O
friendless O
is O
indeed O
to O
be O
unfortunate O
; O
but O
the O
hearts O
of O
men O
, O
when O
unprejudiced O
by O
any O
obvious O
self-interest O
, O
are O
full O
of O

on O
your O
hopes O

the O
moment O

was O
to O
rob O

not O
a O
