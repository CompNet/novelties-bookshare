We O
were O
brought O
up O
together O
; O
there O
was O
not O
quite O
a O
year O
difference O
in O
our O
ages O
. O
I O
need O
not O
say O
that O
we O
were O
strangers O
to O
any O
species O
of O
disunion O
or O
dispute O
. O
Harmony O
was O
the O
soul O
of O
our O
companionship O
, O
and O
the O
diversity O
and O
contrast O
that O
subsisted O
in O
our O
characters O
drew O
us O
nearer O
together O
. O
Elizabeth O
was O
of O
a O
calmer O
and O
more O
concentrated O
disposition O
; O
but O
, O
with O
all O
my O
ardour O
, O
I O
was O
capable O
of O
a O
more O
intense O
application O
, O
and O
was O
more O
deeply O
smitten O
with O
the O
thirst O
for O
knowledge O
. O
She O
busied O
herself O
with O
following O
the O
aerial O
creations O
of O
the O
poets O
; O
and O
in O
the O
majestic O
and O
wondrous O
scenes O
which O
surrounded O
our O
Swiss O
home O
-- O
the O
sublime O
shapes O
of O
the O
mountains O
; O
the O
changes O
of O
the O
seasons O
; O
tempest O
and O
calm O
; O
the O
silence O
of O
winter O
, O
and O
the O
life O
and O
turbulence O
of O
our O
Alpine O
summers O
, O
-- O
she O
found O
ample O
scope O
for O
admiration O
and O
delight O
. O
While O
my O
companion O
contemplated O
with O
a O
serious O
and O
satisfied O
spirit O
the O
magnificent O
appearances O
of O
things O
, O
I O
delighted O
in O
investigating O
their O
causes O
. O
The O
world O
was O
to O
me O
a O
secret O
which O
I O
desired O
to O
divine O
. O
Curiosity O
, O
earnest O
research O
to O
learn O
the O
hidden O
laws O
of O
nature O
, O
gladness O
akin O
to O
rapture O
, O
as O
they O
were O
unfolded O
to O
me O
, O
are O
among O
the O
earliest O
sensations O
I O
can O
remember O
. O
On O
the O
birth O
of O
a O
second O
son O
, O
my O
junior O
by O
seven O
years O
, O
my O
parents O
gave O
up O
entirely O
their O
wandering O
life O
, O
and O
fixed O
themselves O
in O
their O
native O
country O
. O
We O
possessed O
a O
house O
in O
Geneva O
, O
and O
a O
_campagne_ O
on O
Belrive O
, O
the O
eastern O
shore O
of O
the O
lake O
, O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
rather O
more O
than O
a O
league O
from O
the O
city O
. O
We O
resided O
principally O
in O
the O
latter O
, O
and O
the O
lives O
of O
my O
parents O
were O
passed O
in O
considerable O
seclusion O
. O
It O
was O
my O
temper O
to O
avoid O
a O
crowd O
, O
and O
to O
attach O
myself O
fervently O
to O
a O
few O
. O
I O
was O
indifferent O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
my O
schoolfellows O
in O
general O
; O
but O
I O
united O
myself O
in O
the O
bonds O
of O
the O
closest O
friendship O
to O
one O
among O
them O
. O
Henry O
Clerval O
was O
the O
son O
of O
a O
merchant O
of O
Geneva O
. O
He O
was O
a O
boy O
of O
singular O
talent O
and O
fancy O
. O
He O
loved O
enterprise O
, O
hardship O
, O
and O
even O
danger O
, O
for O
its O
own O
sake O
. O
He O
was O
deeply O
read O
in O
books O
of O
chivalry O
and O
romance O
. O
He O
composed O
heroic O
songs O
, O
and O
began O
to O
write O
many O
a O
tale O
of O
enchantment O
and O
knightly O
adventure O
. O
He O
tried O
to O
make O
us O
act O
plays O
, O
and O
to O
enter O
into O
masquerades O
, O
in O
which O
the O
characters O
were O
drawn O
from O
the O
heroes O
of O
Roncesvalles O
, O
of O
the O
Round O
Table O
of O
King O
Arthur O
, O
and O
the O
chivalrous O
train O
who O
shed O
their O
blood O
to O
redeem O
the O
holy O
sepulchre O
from O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
infidels O
. O
No O
human O
being O
could O
have O
passed O
a O
happier O
childhood O
than O
myself O
. O
My O
parents O
were O
possessed O
by O
the O
very O
spirit O
of O
kindness O
and O
indulgence O
. O
We O
felt O
that O
they O
were O
not O
the O
tyrants O
to O
rule O
our O
lot O
according O
to O
their O
caprice O
, O
but O
the O
agents O
and O
creators O
of O
all O
the O
many O
delights O
which O
we O
enjoyed O
. O
When O
I O
mingled O
with O
other O
families O
, O
I O
distinctly O
discerned O
how O
peculiarly O
fortunate O
my O
lot O
was O
, O
and O
gratitude O
assisted O
the O
developement O
of O
filial O
love O
. O
My O
temper O
was O
sometimes O
violent O
, O
and O
my O
passions O
vehement O
; O
but O
by O
some O
law O
in O
my O
temperature O
they O
were O
turned O
, O
not O
towards O
childish O
pursuits O
, O
but O
to O
an O
eager O
desire O
to O
learn O
, O
and O
not O
to O
learn O
all O
things O
indiscriminately O
. O
I O
confess O
that O
neither O
the O
structure O
of O
languages O
, O
nor O
the O
code O
of O
governments O
, O
nor O
the O
politics O
of O
various O
states O
, O
possessed O
attractions O
for O
me O
. O
It O
was O
the O
secrets O
of O
heaven O
and O
earth O
that O
I O
desired O
to O
learn O
; O
and O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
outward O
substance O
of O
things O
, O
or O
the O
inner O
spirit O
of O
nature O
and O
the O
mysterious O
soul O
of O
man O
that O
occupied O
me O
, O
still O
my O
enquiries O
were O
directed O
to O
the O
metaphysical O
, O
or O
, O
in O
its O
highest O
sense O
, O
the O
physical O
secrets O
of O
the O
world O
. O
Meanwhile O
Clerval O
occupied O
himself O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
with O
the O
moral O
relations O
of O
things O
. O
The O
busy O
stage O
of O
life O
, O
the O
virtues O
of O
heroes O
, O
and O
the O
actions O
of O
men O
, O
were O
his O
theme O
; O
and O
his O
hope O
and O
his O
dream O
was O
to O
become O
one O
among O
those O
whose O
names O
are O
recorded O
in O
story O
, O
as O
the O
gallant O
and O
adventurous O
benefactors O
of O
our O
species O
. O
The O
saintly O
soul O
of O
Elizabeth O
shone O
like O
a O
shrine-dedicated O
lamp O
in O
our O
peaceful O
home O
. O
Her O
sympathy O
was O
ours O
; O
her O
smile O
, O
her O
soft O
voice O
, O
the O
sweet O
glance O
of O
her O
celestial O
eyes O
, O
were O
ever O
there O
to O
bless O
and O
animate O
us O
. O
She O
was O
the O
living O
spirit O
of O
love O
to O
soften O
and O
attract O
: O
I O
might O
have O
become O
sullen O
in O
my O
study O
, O
rough O
through O
the O
ardour O
of O
my O
nature O
, O
but O
that O
she O
was O
there O
to O
subdue O
me O
to O
a O
semblance O
of O
her O
own O
gentleness O
. O
And O
Clerval O
-- O
could O
aught O
ill O
entrench O
on O
the O
noble O
spirit O
of O
Clerval O
? O
-- O
yet O
he O
might O
not O
have O
been O
so O
perfectly O
humane O
, O
so O
thoughtful O
in O
his O
generosity O
-- O
so O
full O
of O
kindness O
and O
tenderness O
amidst O
his O
passion O
for O
adventurous O
exploit O
, O
had O
she O
not O
unfolded O
to O
him O
the O
real O
loveliness O
of O
beneficence O
, O
and O
made O
the O
doing O
good O
the O
end O
and O
aim O
of O
his O
soaring O
ambition O
. O
I O
feel O
exquisite O
pleasure O
in O
dwelling O
on O
the O
recollections O
of O
childhood O
, O
before O
misfortune O
had O
tainted O
my O
mind O
, O
and O
changed O
its O
bright O
visions O
of O
extensive O
usefulness O
into O
gloomy O
and O
narrow O
reflections O
upon O
self O
. O
Besides O
, O
in O
drawing O
the O
picture O
of O
my O
early O
days O
, O
I O
also O
record O
those O
events O
which O
led O
, O
by O
insensible O
steps O
, O
to O
my O
after O
tale O
of O
misery O
: O
for O
when O
I O
would O
account O
to O
myself O
for O
the O
birth O
of O
that O
passion O
, O
which O
afterwards O
ruled O
my O
destiny O
, O
I O
find O
it O
arise O
, O
like O
a O
mountain O
river O
, O
from O
ignoble O
and O
almost O
forgotten O
sources O
; O
but O
, O
swelling O
as O
it O
proceeded O
, O
it O
became O
the O
torrent O
which O
, O
in O
its O
course O
, O
has O
swept O
away O
all O
my O
hopes O
and O
joys O
. O
Natural O
philosophy O
is O
the O
genius O
that O
has O
regulated O
my O
fate O
; O
I O
desire O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
this O
narration O
, O
to O
state O
those O
facts O
which O
led O
to O
my O
predilection O
for O
that O
science O
. O
When O
I O
was O
thirteen O
years O
of O
age O
, O
we O
all O
went O
on O
a O
party O
of O
pleasure O
to O
the O
baths O
near O
Thonon O
: O
the O
inclemency O
of O
the O
weather O
obliged O
us O
to O
remain O
a O
day O
confined O
to O
the O
inn O
. O
In O
this O
house O
I O
chanced O
to O
find O
a O
volume O
of O
the O
works O
of O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
. O
I O
opened O
it O
with O
apathy O
; O
the O
theory O
which O
he O
attempts O
to O
demonstrate O
, O
and O
the O
wonderful O
facts O
which O
he O
relates O
, O
soon O
changed O
this O
feeling O
into O
enthusiasm O
. O
A O
new O
light O
seemed O
to O
dawn O
upon O
my O
mind O
; O
and O
, O
bounding O
with O
joy O
, O
I O
communicated O
my O
discovery O
to O
my O
father O
. O
My O
father O
looked O
carelessly O
at O
the O
titlepage O
of O
my O
book O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Ah O
! O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
! O
My O
dear O
Victor O
, O
do O
not O
waste O
your O
time O
upon O
this O
; O
it O
is O
sad O
trash O
. O
" O
If O
, O
instead O
of O
this O
remark O
, O
my O
father O
had O
taken O
the O
pains O
to O
explain O
to O
me O
, O
that O
the O
principles O
of O
Agrippa O
had O
been O
entirely O
exploded O
, O
and O
that O
a O
modern O
system O
of O
science O
had O
been O
introduced O
, O
which O
possessed O
much O
greater O
powers O
than O
the O
ancient O
, O
because O
the O
powers O
of O
the O
latter O
were O
chimerical O
, O
while O
those O
of O
the O
former O
were O
real O
and O
practical O
; O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
I O
should O
certainly O
have O
thrown O
Agrippa O
aside O
, O
and O
have O
contented O
my O
imagination O
, O
warmed O
as O
it O
was O
, O
by O
returning O
with O
greater O
ardour O
to O
my O
former O
studies O
. O
It O
is O
even O
possible O
, O
that O
the O
train O
of O
my O
ideas O
would O
never O
have O
received O
the O
fatal O
impulse O
that O
led O
to O
my O
ruin O
. O
But O
the O
cursory O
glance O
my O
father O
had O
taken O
of O
my O
volume O
by O
no O
means O
assured O
me O
that O
he O
was O
acquainted O
with O
its O
contents O
; O
and O
I O
continued O
to O
read O
with O
the O
greatest O
avidity O
. O
When O
I O
returned O
home O
, O
my O
first O
care O
was O
to O
procure O
the O
whole O
works O
of O
this O
author O
, O
and O
afterwards O
of O
Paracelsus O
and O
Albertus O
Magnus O
. O
I O
read O
and O
studied O
the O
wild O
fancies O
of O
these O
writers O
with O
delight O
; O
they O
appeared O
to O
me O
treasures O
known O
to O
few O
beside O
myself O
. O
I O
have O
described O
myself O
as O
always O
having O
been O
embued O
with O
a O
fervent O
longing O
to O
penetrate O
the O
secrets O
of O
nature O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
the O
intense O
labour O
and O
wonderful O
discoveries O
of O
modern O
philosophers O
, O
I O
always O
came O
from O
my O
studies O
discontented O
and O
unsatisfied O
. O
Sir O
Isaac O
Newton O
is O
said O
to O
have O
avowed O
that O
he O
felt O
like O
a O
child O
picking O
up O
shells O
beside O
the O
great O
and O
unexplored O
ocean O
of O
truth O
. O
Those O
of O
his O
successors O
in O
each O
branch O
of O
natural O
philosophy O
with O
whom O
I O
was O
acquainted O
, O
appeared O
even O
to O
my O
boy O
's O
apprehensions O
, O
as O
tyros O
engaged O
in O
the O
same O
pursuit O
. O
The O
untaught O
peasant O
beheld O
the O
elements O
around O
him O
, O
and O
was O
acquainted O
with O
their O
practical O
uses O
. O
The O
most O
learned O
philosopher O
knew O
little O
more O
. O
He O
had O
partially O
unveiled O
the O
face O
of O
Nature O
, O
but O
her O
immortal O
lineaments O
were O
still O
a O
wonder O
and O
a O
mystery O
. O
He O
might O
dissect O
, O
anatomise O
, O
and O
give O
names O
; O
but O
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
a O
final O
cause O
, O
causes O
in O
their O
secondary O
and O
tertiary O
grades O
were O
utterly O
unknown O
to O
him O
. O
I O
had O
gazed O
upon O
the O
fortifications O
and O
impediments O
that O
seemed O
to O
keep O
human O
beings O
from O
entering O
the O
citadel O
of O
nature O
, O
and O
rashly O
and O
ignorantly O
I O
had O
repined O
. O
But O
here O
were O
books O
, O
and O
here O
were O
men O
who O
had O
penetrated O
deeper O
and O
knew O
more O
. O
I O
took O
their O
word O
for O
all O
that O
they O
averred O
, O
and O
I O
became O
their O
disciple O
. O
It O
may O
appear O
strange O
that O
such O
should O
arise O
in O
the O
eighteenth O
century O
; O
but O
while O
I O
followed O
the O
routine O
of O
education O
in O
the O
schools O
of O
Geneva O
, O
I O
was O
, O
to O
a O
great O
degree O
, O
self O
taught O
with O
regard O
to O
my O
favourite O
studies O
. O
My O
father O
was O
not O
scientific O
, O
and O
I O
was O
left O
to O
struggle O
with O
a O
child O
's O
blindness O
, O
added O
to O
a O
student O
's O
thirst O
for O
knowledge O
. O
Under O
the O
guidance O
of O
my O
new O
preceptors O
, O
I O
entered O
with O
the O
greatest O
diligence O
into O
the O
search O
of O
the O
philosopher O
's O
stone O
and O
the O
elixir O
of O
life O
; O
but O
the O
latter O
soon O
obtained O
my O
undivided O
attention O
. O
Wealth O
was O
an O
inferior O
object O
; O
but O
what O
glory O
would O
attend O
the O
discovery O
, O
if O
I O
could O
banish O
disease O
from O
the O
human O
frame O
, O
and O
render O
man O
invulnerable O
to O
any O
but O
a O
violent O
death O
! O
Nor O
were O
these O
my O
only O
visions O
. O
The O
raising O
of O
ghosts O
or O
devils O
was O
a O
promise O
liberally O
accorded O
by O
my O
favourite O
authors O
, O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
which O
I O
most O
eagerly O
sought O
; O
and O
if O
my O
incantations O
were O
always O
unsuccessful O
, O
I O
attributed O
the O
failure O
rather O
to O
my O
own O
inexperience O
and O
mistake O
, O
than O
to O
a O
want O
of O
skill O
or O
fidelity O
in O
my O
instructors O
. O
And O
thus O
for O
a O
time O
I O
was O
occupied O
by O
exploded O
systems O
, O
mingling O
, O
like O
an O
unadept O
, O
a O
thousand O
contradictory O
theories O
, O
and O
floundering O
desperately O
in O
a O
very O
slough O
of O
multifarious O
knowledge O
, O
guided O
by O
an O
ardent O
imagination O
and O
childish O
reasoning O
, O
till O
an O
accident O
again O
changed O
the O
current O
of O
my O
ideas O
. O
When O
I O
was O
about O
fifteen O
years O
old O
we O
had O
retired O
to O
our O
house O
near O
Belrive O
, O
when O
we O
witnessed O
a O
most O
violent O
and O
terrible O
thunder-storm O
. O
It O
advanced O
from O
behind O
the O
mountains O
of O
Jura O
; O
and O
the O
thunder O
burst O
at O
once O
with O
frightful O
loudness O
from O
various O
quarters O
of O
the O
heavens O
. O
I O
remained O
, O
while O
the O
storm O
lasted O
, O
watching O
its O
progress O
with O
curiosity O
and O
delight O
. O
As O
I O
stood O
at O
the O
door O
, O
on O
a O
sudden O
I O
beheld O
a O
stream O
of O
fire O
issue O
from O
an O
old O
and O
beautiful O
oak O
, O
which O
stood O
about O
twenty O
yards O
from O
our O
house O
; O
and O
so O
soon O
as O
the O
dazzling O
light O
vanished O
, O
the O
oak O
had O
disappeared O
, O
and O
nothing O
remained O
but O
a O
blasted O
stump O
. O
When O
we O
visited O
it O
the O
next O
morning O
, O
we O
found O
the O
tree O
shattered O
in O
a O
singular O
manner O
. O
It O
was O
not O
splintered O
by O
the O
shock O
, O
but O
entirely O
reduced O
to O
thin O
ribands O
of O
wood O
. O
I O
never O
beheld O
any O
thing O
so O
utterly O
destroyed O
. O
Before O
this O
I O
was O
not O
unacquainted O
with O
the O
more O
obvious O
laws O
of O
electricity O
. O
On O
this O
occasion O
a O
man O
of O
great O
research O
in O
natural O
philosophy O
was O
with O
us O
, O
and O
, O
excited O
by O
this O
catastrophe O
, O
he O
entered O
on O
the O
explanation O
of O
a O
theory O
which O
he O
had O
formed O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
electricity O
and O
galvanism O
, O
which O
was O
at O
once O
new O
and O
astonishing O
to O
me O
. O
All O
that O
he O
said O
threw O
greatly O
into O
the O
shade O
Cornelius O
Agrippa O
, O
Albertus O
Magnus O
, O
and O
Paracelsus O
, O
the O
lords O
of O
my O
imagination O
; O
but O
by O
some O
fatality O
the O
overthrow O
of O
these O
men O
disinclined O
me O
to O
pursue O
my O
accustomed O
studies O
. O
It O
seemed O
to O
me O
as O
if O
nothing O
would O
or O
could O
ever O
be O
known O
. O
All O
that O
had O
so O
long O
engaged O
my O
attention O
suddenly O
grew O
despicable O
. O
By O
one O
of O
those O
caprices O
of O
the O
mind O
, O
which O
we O
are O
perhaps O
most O
subject O
to O
in O
early O
youth O
, O
I O
at O
once O
gave O
up O
my O
former O
occupations O
; O
set O
down O
natural O
history O
and O
all O
its O
progeny O
as O
a O
deformed O
and O
abortive O
creation O
; O
and O
entertained O
the O
greatest O
disdain O
for O
a O
would-be O
science O
, O
which O
could O
never O
even O
step O
within O
the O
threshold O
of O
real O
knowledge O
. O
In O
this O
mood O
of O
mind O
I O
betook O
myself O
to O
the O
mathematics O
, O
and O
the O
branches O
of O
study O
appertaining O
to O
that O
science O
, O
as O
being O
built O
upon O
secure O
foundations O
, O
and O
so O
worthy O
of O
my O
consideration O
. O
Thus O
strangely O
are O
our O
souls O
constructed O
, O
and O
by O
such O
slight O
ligaments O
are O
we O
bound O
to O
prosperity O
or O
ruin O
. O
When O
I O
look O
back O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
as O
if O
this O
almost O
miraculous O
change O
of O
inclination O
and O
will O
was O
the O
immediate O
suggestion O
of O
the O
guardian O
angel O
of O
my O
life O
-- O
the O
last O
effort O
made O
by O
the O
spirit O
of O
preservation O
to O
avert O
the O
storm O
that O
was O
even O
then O
hanging O
in O
the O
stars O
, O
and O
ready O
to O
envelope O
me O
. O
Her O
victory O
was O
announced O
by O
an O
unusual O
tranquillity O
and O
gladness O
of O
soul O
, O
which O
followed O
the O
relinquishing O
of O
my O
ancient O
and O
latterly O
tormenting O
studies O
. O
It O
was O
thus O
that O
I O
was O
to O
be O
taught O
to O
associate O
evil O
with O
their O
prosecution O
, O
happiness O
with O
their O
disregard O
. O
It O
was O
a O
strong O
effort O
of O
the O
spirit O
of O
good O
; O
but O
it O
was O
ineffectual O
. O
Destiny O
was O
too O
potent O
, O
and O
her O
immutable O
laws O
had O
decreed O
my O
utter O
and O
terrible O
destruction O
. O
