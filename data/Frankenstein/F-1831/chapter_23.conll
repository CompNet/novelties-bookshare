LONDON O
was O
our O
present O
point O
of O
rest O
; O
we O
determined O
to O
remain O
several O
months O
in O
this O
wonderful O
and O
celebrated O
city O
. O
Clerval O
desired O
the O
intercourse O
of O
the O
men O
of O
genius O
and O
talent O
who O
flourished O
at O
this O
time O
; O
but O
this O
was O
with O
me O
a O
secondary O
object O
; O
I O
was O
principally O
occupied O
with O
the O
means O
of O
obtaining O
the O
information O
necessary O
for O
the O
completion O
of O
my O
promise O
, O
and O
quickly O
availed O
myself O
of O
the O
letters O
of O
introduction O
that O
I O
had O
brought O
with O
me O
, O
addressed O
to O
the O
most O
distinguished O
natural O
philosophers O
. O
If O
this O
journey O
had O
taken O
place O
during O
my O
days O
of O
study O
and O
happiness O
, O
it O
would O
have O
afforded O
me O
inexpressible O
pleasure O
. O
But O
a O
blight O
had O
come O
over O
my O
existence O
, O
and O
I O
only O
visited O
these O
people O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
information O
they O
might O
give O
me O
on O
the O
subject O
in O
which O
my O
interest O
was O
so O
terribly O
profound O
. O
Company O
was O
irksome O
to O
me O
; O
when O
alone O
, O
I O
could O
fill O
my O
mind O
with O
the O
sights O
of O
heaven O
and O
earth O
; O
the O
voice O
of O
Henry O
soothed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
could O
thus O
cheat O
myself O
into O
a O
transitory O
peace O
. O
But O
busy O
uninteresting O
joyous O
faces O
brought O
back O
despair O
to O
my O
heart O
. O
I O
saw O
an O
insurmountable O
barrier O
placed O
between O
me O
and O
my O
fellow-men O
; O
this O
barrier O
was O
sealed O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
William O
and O
Justine O
; O
and O
to O
reflect O
on O
the O
events O
connected O
with O
those O
names O
filled O
my O
soul O
with O
anguish O
. O
But O
in O
Clerval O
I O
saw O
the O
image O
of O
my O
former O
self O
; O
he O
was O
inquisitive O
, O
and O
anxious O
to O
gain O
experience O
and O
instruction O
. O
The O
difference O
of O
manners O
which O
he O
observed O
was O
to O
him O
an O
inexhaustible O
source O
of O
instruction O
and O
amusement O
. O
He O
was O
also O
pursuing O
an O
object O
he O
had O
long O
had O
in O
view O
. O
His O
design O
was O
to O
visit O
India O
, O
in O
the O
belief O
that O
he O
had O
in O
his O
knowledge O
of O
its O
various O
languages O
, O
and O
in O
the O
views O
he O
had O
taken O
of O
its O
society O
, O
the O
means O
of O
materially O
assisting O
the O
progress O
of O
European O
colonisation O
and O
trade O
. O
In O
Britain O
only O
could O
he O
further O
the O
execution O
of O
his O
plan O
. O
He O
was O
for O
ever O
busy O
; O
and O
the O
only O
check O
to O
his O
enjoyments O
was O
my O
sorrowful O
and O
dejected O
mind O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
conceal O
this O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
that O
I O
might O
not O
debar O
him O
from O
the O
pleasures O
natural O
to O
one O
, O
who O
was O
entering O
on O
a O
new O
scene O
of O
life O
, O
undisturbed O
by O
any O
care O
or O
bitter O
recollection O
. O
I O
often O
refused O
to O
accompany O
him O
, O
alleging O
another O
engagement O
, O
that O
I O
might O
remain O
alone O
. O
I O
now O
also O
began O
to O
collect O
the O
materials O
necessary O
for O
my O
new O
creation O
, O
and O
this O
was O
to O
me O
like O
the O
torture O
of O
single O
drops O
of O
water O
continually O
falling O
on O
the O
head O
. O
Every O
thought O
that O
was O
devoted O
to O
it O
was O
an O
extreme O
anguish O
, O
and O
every O
word O
that O
I O
spoke O
in O
allusion O
to O
it O
caused O
my O
lips O
to O
quiver O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
to O
palpitate O
. O
After O
passing O
some O
months O
in O
London O
, O
we O
received O
a O
letter O
from O
a O
person O
in O
Scotland O
, O
who O
had O
formerly O
been O
our O
visiter O
at O
Geneva O
. O
He O
mentioned O
the O
beauties O
of O
his O
native O
country O
, O
and O
asked O
us O
if O
those O
were O
not O
sufficient O
allurements O
to O
induce O
us O
to O
prolong O
our O
journey O
as O
far O
north O
as O
Perth O
, O
where O
he O
resided O
. O
Clerval O
eagerly O
desired O
to O
accept O
this O
invitation O
; O
and O
I O
, O
although O
I O
abhorred O
society O
, O
wished O
to O
view O
again O
mountains O
and O
streams O
, O
and O
all O
the O
wondrous O
works O
with O
which O
Nature O
adorns O
her O
chosen O
dwelling-places O
. O
We O
had O
arrived O
in O
England O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
October O
, O
and O
it O
was O
now O
February O
. O
We O
accordingly O
determined O
to O
commence O
our O
journey O
towards O
the O
north O
at O
the O
expiration O
of O
another O
month O
. O
In O
this O
expedition O
we O
did O
not O
intend O
to O
follow O
the O
great O
road O
to O
Edinburgh O
, O
but O
to O
visit O
Windsor O
, O
Oxford O
, O
Matlock O
, O
and O
the O
Cumberland O
lakes O
, O
resolving O
to O
arrive O
at O
the O
completion O
of O
this O
tour O
about O
the O
end O
of O
July O
. O
I O
packed O
up O
my O
chemical O
instruments O
, O
and O
the O
materials O
I O
had O
collected O
, O
resolving O
to O
finish O
my O
labours O
in O
some O
obscure O
nook O
in O
the O
northern O
highlands O
of O
Scotland O
. O
We O
quitted O
London O
on O
the O
27th O
of O
March O
, O
and O
remained O
a O
few O
days O
at O
Windsor O
, O
rambling O
in O
its O
beautiful O
forest O
. O
This O
was O
a O
new O
scene O
to O
us O
mountaineers O
; O
the O
majestic O
oaks O
, O
the O
quantity O
of O
game O
, O
and O
the O
herds O
of O
stately O
deer O
, O
were O
all O
novelties O
to O
us O
. O
From O
thence O
we O
proceeded O
to O
Oxford O
. O
As O
we O
entered O
this O
city O
, O
our O
minds O
were O
filled O
with O
the O
remembrance O
of O
the O
events O
that O
had O
been O
transacted O
there O
more O
than O
a O
century O
and O
a O
half O
before O
. O
It O
was O
here O
that O
Charles O
I. O
had O
collected O
his O
forces O
. O
This O
city O
had O
remained O
faithful O
to O
him O
, O
after O
the O
whole O
nation O
had O
forsaken O
his O
cause O
to O
join O
the O
standard O
of O
parliament O
and O
liberty O
. O
The O
memory O
of O
that O
unfortunate O
king O
, O
and O
his O
companions O
, O
the O
amiable O
Falkland O
, O
the O
insolent O
Goring O
, O
his O
queen O
, O
and O
son O
, O
gave O
a O
peculiar O
interest O
to O
every O
part O
of O
the O
city O
, O
which O
they O
might O
be O
supposed O
to O
have O
inhabited O
. O
The O
spirit O
of O
elder O
days O
found O
a O
dwelling O
here O
, O
and O
we O
delighted O
to O
trace O
its O
footsteps O
. O
If O
these O
feelings O
had O
not O
found O
an O
imaginary O
gratification O
, O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
city O
had O
yet O
in O
itself O
sufficient O
beauty O
to O
obtain O
our O
admiration O
. O
The O
colleges O
are O
ancient O
and O
picturesque O
; O
the O
streets O
are O
almost O
magnificent O
; O
and O
the O
lovely O
Isis O
, O
which O
flows O
beside O
it O
through O
meadows O
of O
exquisite O
verdure O
, O
is O
spread O
forth O
into O
a O
placid O
expanse O
of O
waters O
, O
which O
reflects O
its O
majestic O
assemblage O
of O
towers O
, O
and O
spires O
, O
and O
domes O
, O
embosomed O
among O
aged O
trees O
. O
I O
enjoyed O
this O
scene O
; O
and O
yet O
my O
enjoyment O
was O
embittered O
both O
by O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
past O
, O
and O
the O
anticipation O
of O
the O
future O
. O
I O
was O
formed O
for O
peaceful O
happiness O
. O
During O
my O
youthful O
days O
discontent O
never O
visited O
my O
mind O
; O
and O
if O
I O
was O
ever O
overcome O
by O
ennui O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
what O
is O
beautiful O
in O
nature O
, O
or O
the O
study O
of O
what O
is O
excellent O
and O
sublime O
in O
the O
productions O
of O
man O
, O
could O
always O
interest O
my O
heart O
, O
and O
communicate O
elasticity O
to O
my O
spirits O
. O
But O
I O
am O
a O
blasted O
tree O
; O
the O
bolt O
has O
entered O
my O
soul O
; O
and O
I O
felt O
then O
that O
I O
should O
survive O
to O
exhibit O
, O
what O
I O
shall O
soon O
cease O
to O
be—a O
miserable O
spectacle O
of O
wrecked O
humanity O
, O
pitiable O
to O
others O
, O
and O
intolerable O
to O
myself O
. O
We O
passed O
a O
considerable O
period O
at O
Oxford O
, O
rambling O
among O
its O
environs O
, O
and O
endeavouring O
to O
identify O
every O
spot O
which O
might O
relate O
to O
the O
most O
animating O
epoch O
of O
English O
history O
. O
Our O
little O
voyages O
of O
discovery O
were O
often O
prolonged O
by O
the O
successive O
objects O
that O
presented O
themselves O
. O
We O
visited O
the O
tomb O
of O
the O
illustrious O
Hampden O
, O
and O
the O
field O
on O
which O
that O
patriot O
fell O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
my O
soul O
was O
elevated O
from O
its O
debasing O
and O
miserable O
fears O
, O
to O
contemplate O
the O
divine O
ideas O
of O
liberty O
and O
self-sacrifice O
, O
of O
which O
these O
sights O
were O
the O
monuments O
and O
the O
remembrancers O
. O
For O
an O
instant O
I O
dared O
to O
shake O
off O
my O
chains O
, O
and O
look O
around O
me O
with O
a O
free O
and O
lofty O
spirit O
; O
but O
the O
iron O
had O
eaten O
into O
my O
flesh O
, O
and O
I O
sank O
again O
, O
trembling O
and O
hopeless O
, O
into O
my O
miserable O
self O
. O
We O
left O
Oxford O
with O
regret O
, O
and O
proceeded O
to O
Matlock O
, O
which O
was O
our O
next O
place O
of O
rest O
. O
The O
country O
in O
the O
neighbourhood O
of O
this O
village O
resembled O
, O
to O
a O
greater O
degree O
, O
the O
scenery O
of O
Switzerland O
; O
but O
every O
thing O
is O
on O
a O
lower O
scale O
, O
and O
the O
green O
hills O
want O
the O
crown O
of O
distant O
white O
Alps O
, O
which O
always O
attend O
on O
the O
piny O
mountains O
of O
my O
native O
country O
. O
We O
visited O
the O
wondrous O
cave O
, O
and O
the O
little O
cabinets O
of O
natural O
history O
, O
where O
the O
curiosities O
are O
disposed O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
as O
in O
the O
collections O
at O
Servox O
and O
Chamounix O
. O
The O
latter O
name O
made O
me O
tremble O
, O
when O
pronounced O
by O
Henry O
; O
and O
I O
hastened O
to O
quit O
Matlock O
, O
with O
which O
that O
terrible O
scene O
was O
thus O
associated O
. O
From O
Derby O
, O
still O
journeying O
northward O
, O
we O
passed O
two O
months O
in O
Cumberland O
and O
Westmorland O
. O
I O
could O
now O
almost O
fancy O
myself O
among O
the O
Swiss O
mountains O
. O
The O
little O
patches O
of O
snow O
which O
yet O
lingered O
on O
the O
northern O
sides O
of O
the O
mountains O
, O
the O
lakes O
, O
and O
the O
dashing O
of O
the O
rocky O
streams O
, O
were O
all O
familiar O
and O
dear O
sights O
to O
me O
. O
Here O
also O
we O
made O
some O
acquaintances O
, O
who O
almost O
contrived O
to O
cheat O
me O
into O
happiness O
. O
The O
delight O
of O
Clerval O
was O
proportionably O
greater O
than O
mine O
; O
his O
mind O
expanded O
in O
the O
company O
of O
men O
of O
talent O
, O
and O
he O
found O
in O
his O
own O
nature O
greater O
capacities O
and O
resources O
than O
he O
could O
have O
imagined O
himself O
to O
have O
possessed O
while O
he O
associated O
with O
his O
inferiors O
. O
" O
I O
could O
pass O
my O
life O
here O
, O
" O
said O
he O
to O
me O
; O
" O
and O
among O
these O
mountains O
I O
should O
scarcely O
regret O
Switzerland O
and O
the O
Rhine O
. O
" O
But O
he O
found O
that O
a O
traveller O
's O
life O
is O
one O
that O
includes O
much O
pain O
amidst O
its O
enjoyments O
. O
His O
feelings O
are O
for O
ever O
on O
the O
stretch O
; O
and O
when O
he O
begins O
to O
sink O
into O
repose O
, O
he O
finds O
himself O
obliged O
to O
quit O
that O
on O
which O
he O
rests O
in O
pleasure O
for O
something O
new O
, O
which O
again O
engages O
his O
attention O
, O
and O
which O
also O
he O
forsakes O
for O
other O
novelties O
. O
We O
had O
scarcely O
visited O
the O
various O
lakes O
of O
Cumberland O
and O
Westmorland O
, O
and O
conceived O
an O
affection O
for O
some O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
when O
the O
period O
of O
our O
appointment O
with O
our O
Scotch O
friend O
approached O
, O
and O
we O
left O
them O
to O
travel O
on O
. O
For O
my O
own O
part O
I O
was O
not O
sorry O
. O
I O
had O
now O
neglected O
my O
promise O
for O
some O
time O
, O
and O
I O
feared O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
dæmon O
's O
disappointment O
. O
He O
might O
remain O
in O
Switzerland O
, O
and O
wreak O
his O
vengeance O
on O
my O
relatives O
. O
This O
idea O
pursued O
me O
, O
and O
tormented O
me O
at O
every O
moment O
from O
which O
I O
might O
otherwise O
have O
snatched O
repose O
and O
peace O
. O
I O
waited O
for O
my O
letters O
with O
feverish O
impatience O
: O
if O
they O
were O
delayed O
, O
I O
was O
miserable O
, O
and O
overcome O
by O
a O
thousand O
fears O
; O
and O
when O
they O
arrived O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
superscription O
of O
Elizabeth O
or O
my O
father O
, O
I O
hardly O
dared O
to O
read O
and O
ascertain O
my O
fate O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
fiend O
followed O
me O
, O
and O
might O
expedite O
my O
remissness O
by O
murdering O
my O
companion O
. O
When O
these O
thoughts O
possessed O
me O
, O
I O
would O
not O
quit O
Henry O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
but O
followed O
him O
as O
his O
shadow O
, O
to O
protect O
him O
from O
the O
fancied O
rage O
of O
his O
destroyer O
. O
I O
felt O
as O
if O
I O
had O
committed O
some O
great O
crime O
, O
the O
consciousness O
of O
which O
haunted O
me O
. O
I O
was O
guiltless O
, O
but O
I O
had O
indeed O
drawn O
down O
a O
horrible O
curse O
upon O
my O
head O
, O
as O
mortal O
as O
that O
of O
crime O
. O
I O
visited O
Edinburgh O
with O
languid O
eyes O
and O
mind O
; O
and O
yet O
that O
city O
might O
have O
interested O
the O
most O
unfortunate O
being O
. O
Clerval O
did O
not O
like O
it O
so O
well O
as O
Oxford O
: O
for O
the O
antiquity O
of O
the O
latter O
city O
was O
more O
pleasing O
to O
him O
. O
But O
the O
beauty O
and O
regularity O
of O
the O
new O
town O
of O
Edinburgh O
, O
its O
romantic O
castle O
, O
and O
its O
environs O
, O
the O
most O
delightful O
in O
the O
world O
, O
Arthur O
's O
Seat O
, O
St. O
Bernard O
's O
Well O
, O
and O
the O
Pentland O
Hills O
, O
compensated O
him O
for O
the O
change O
, O
and O
filled O
him O
with O
cheerfulness O
and O
admiration O
. O
But O
I O
was O
impatient O
to O
arrive O
at O
the O
termination O
of O
my O
journey O
. O
We O
left O
Edinburgh O
in O
a O
week O
, O
passing O
through O
Coupar O
, O
St. O
Andrew O
's O
, O
and O
along O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Tay O
, O
to O
Perth O
, O
where O
our O
friend O
expected O
us O
. O
But O
I O
was O
in O
no O
mood O
to O
laugh O
and O
talk O
with O
strangers O
, O
or O
enter O
into O
their O
feelings O
or O
plans O
with O
the O
good O
humour O
expected O
from O
a O
guest O
; O
and O
accordingly O
I O
told O
Clerval O
that O
I O
wished O
to O
make O
the O
tour O
of O
Scotland O
alone O
. O
" O
Do O
you O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
enjoy O
yourself O
, O
and O
let O
this O
be O
our O
rendezvous O
. O
I O
may O
be O
absent O
a O
month O
or O
two O
; O
but O
do O
not O
interfere O
with O
my O
motions O
, O
I O
entreat O
you O
: O
leave O
me O
to O
peace O
and O
solitude O
for O
a O
short O
time O
; O
and O
when O
I O
return O
, O
I O
hope O
it O
will O
be O
with O
a O
lighter O
heart O
, O
more O
congenial O
to O
your O
own O
temper O
. O
" O
Henry O
wished O
to O
dissuade O
me O
; O
but O
, O
seeing O
me O
bent O
on O
this O
plan O
, O
ceased O
to O
remonstrate O
. O
He O
entreated O
me O
to O
write O
often O
. O
" O
I O
had O
rather O
be O
with O
you O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
" O
in O
your O
solitary O
rambles O
, O
than O
with O
these O
Scotch O
people O
, O
whom O
I O
do O
not O
know O
: O
hasten O
then O
, O
my O
dear O
friend O
, O
to O
return O
, O
that O
I O
may O
again O
feel O
myself O
somewhat O
at O
home O
, O
which O
I O
can O
not O
do O
in O
your O
absence O
. O
" O
Having O
parted O
from O
my O
friend O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
visit O
some O
remote O
spot O
of O
Scotland O
, O
and O
finish O
my O
work O
in O
solitude O
. O
I O
did O
not O
doubt O
but O
that O
the O
monster O
followed O
me O
, O
and O
would O
discover O
himself O
to O
me O
when O
I O
should O
have O
finished O
, O
that O
he O
might O
receive O
his O
companion O
. O
With O
this O
resolution O
I O
traversed O
the O
northern O
highlands O
, O
and O
fixed O
on O
one O
of O
the O
remotest O
of O
the O
Orkneys O
as O
the O
scene O
of O
my O
labours O
. O
It O
was O
a O
place O
fitted O
for O
such O
a O
work O
, O
being O
hardly O
more O
than O
a O
rock O
, O
whose O
high O
sides O
were O
continually O
beaten O
upon O
by O
the O
waves O
. O
The O
soil O
was O
barren O
, O
scarcely O
affording O
pasture O
for O
a O
few O
miserable O
cows O
, O
and O
oatmeal O
for O
its O
inhabitants O
, O
which O
consisted O
of O
five O
persons O
, O
whose O
gaunt O
and O
scraggy O
limbs O
gave O
tokens O
of O
their O
miserable O
fare O
. O
Vegetables O
and O
bread O
, O
when O
they O
indulged O
in O
such O
luxuries O
, O
and O
even O
fresh O
water O
, O
was O
to O
be O
procured O
from O
the O
main O
land O
, O
which O
was O
about O
five O
miles O
distant O
. O
On O
the O
whole O
island O
there O
were O
but O
three O
miserable O
huts O
, O
and O
one O
of O
these O
was O
vacant O
when O
I O
arrived O
. O
This O
I O
hired O
. O
It O
contained O
but O
two O
rooms O
, O
and O
these O
exhibited O
all O
the O
squalidness O
of O
the O
most O
miserable O
penury O
. O
The O
thatch O
had O
fallen O
in O
, O
the O
walls O
were O
unplastered O
, O
and O
the O
door O
was O
off O
its O
hinges O
. O
I O
ordered O
it O
to O
be O
repaired O
, O
bought O
some O
furniture O
, O
and O
took O
possession O
; O
an O
incident O
which O
would O
, O
doubtless O
, O
have O
occasioned O
some O
surprise O
, O
had O
not O
all O
the O
senses O
of O
the O
cottagers O
been O
benumbed O
by O
want O
and O
squalid O
poverty O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
I O
lived O
ungazed O
at O
and O
unmolested O
, O
hardly O
thanked O
for O
the O
pittance O
of O
food O
and O
clothes O
which O
I O
gave O
; O
so O
much O
does O
suffering O
blunt O
even O
the O
coarsest O
sensations O
of O
men O
. O
In O
this O
retreat O
I O
devoted O
the O
morning O
to O
labour O
; O
but O
in O
the O
evening O
, O
when O
the O
weather O
permitted O
, O
I O
walked O
on O
the O
stony O
beach O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
to O
listen O
to O
the O
waves O
as O
they O
roared O
and O
dashed O
at O
my O
feet O
. O
It O
was O
a O
monotonous O
yet O
ever-changing O
scene O
. O
I O
thought O
of O
Switzerland O
; O
it O
was O
far O
different O
from O
this O
desolate O
and O
appalling O
landscape O
. O
Its O
hills O
are O
covered O
with O
vines O
, O
and O
its O
cottages O
are O
scattered O
thickly O
in O
the O
plains O
. O
Its O
fair O
lakes O
reflect O
a O
blue O
and O
gentle O
sky O
; O
and O
, O
when O
troubled O
by O
the O
winds O
, O
their O
tumult O
is O
but O
as O
the O
play O
of O
a O
lively O
infant O
, O
when O
compared O
to O
the O
roarings O
of O
the O
giant O
ocean O
. O
In O
this O
manner O
I O
distributed O
my O
occupations O
when O
I O
first O
arrived O
; O
but O
, O
as O
I O
proceeded O
in O
my O
labour O
, O
it O
became O
every O
day O
more O
horrible O
and O
irksome O
to O
me O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
could O
not O
prevail O
on O
myself O
to O
enter O
my O
laboratory O
for O
several O
days O
; O
and O
at O
other O
times O
I O
toiled O
day O
and O
night O
in O
order O
to O
complete O
my O
work O
. O
It O
was O
, O
indeed O
, O
a O
filthy O
process O
in O
which O
I O
was O
engaged O
. O
During O
my O
first O
experiment O
, O
a O
kind O
of O
enthusiastic O
frenzy O
had O
blinded O
me O
to O
the O
horror O
of O
my O
employment O
; O
my O
mind O
was O
intently O
fixed O
on O
the O
consummation O
of O
my O
labour O
, O
and O
my O
eyes O
were O
shut O
to O
the O
horror O
of O
my O
proceedings O
. O
But O
now O
I O
went O
to O
it O
in O
cold O
blood O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
often O
sickened O
at O
the O
work O
of O
my O
hands O
. O
Thus O
situated O
, O
employed O
in O
the O
most O
detestable O
occupation O
, O
immersed O
in O
a O
solitude O
where O
nothing O
could O
for O
an O
instant O
call O
my O
attention O
from O
the O
actual O
scene O
in O
which O
I O
was O
engaged O
, O
my O
spirits O
became O
unequal O
; O
I O
grew O
restless O
and O
nervous O
. O
Every O
moment O
I O
feared O
to O
meet O
my O
persecutor O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
sat O
with O
my O
eyes O
fixed O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
fearing O
to O
raise O
them O
, O
lest O
they O
should O
encounter O
the O
object O
which O
I O
so O
much O
dreaded O
to O
behold O
. O
I O
feared O
to O
wander O
from O
the O
sight O
of O
my O
fellow-creatures O
, O
lest O
when O
alone O
he O
should O
come O
to O
claim O
his O
companion O
. O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
I O
worked O
on O
, O
and O
my O
labour O
was O
already O
considerably O
advanced O
. O
I O
looked O
towards O
its O
completion O
with O
a O
tremulous O
and O
eager O
hope O
, O
which O
I O
dared O
not O
trust O
myself O
to O
question O
, O
but O
which O
was O
intermixed O
with O
obscure O
forebodings O
of O
evil O
, O
that O
made O
my O
heart O
sicken O
in O
my O
bosom O
. O
