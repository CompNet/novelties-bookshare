I O
AM O
by O
birth O
a O
Genevese O
; O
and O
my O
family O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
distinguished O
of O
that O
republic O
. O
My O
ancestors O
had O
been O
for O
many O
years O
counsellors O
and O
syndics O
; O
and O
my O
father O
had O
filled O
several O
public O
situations O
with O
honour O
and O
reputation O
. O
He O
was O
respected O
by O
all O
who O
knew O
him O
, O
for O
his O
integrity O
and O
indefatigable O
attention O
to O
public O
business O
. O
He O
passed O
his O
younger O
days O
perpetually O
occupied O
by O
the O
affairs O
of O
his O
country O
; O
a O
variety O
of O
circumstances O
had O
prevented O
his O
marrying O
early O
, O
nor O
was O
it O
until O
the O
decline O
of O
life O
that O
he O
became O
a O
husband O
and O
the O
father O
of O
a O
family O
. O
As O
the O
circumstances O
of O
his O
marriage O
illustrate O
his O
character O
, O
I O
can O
not O
refrain O
from O
relating O
them O
. O
One O
of O
his O
most O
intimate O
friends O
was O
a O
merchant O
, O
who O
, O
from O
a O
flourishing O
state O
, O
fell O
, O
through O
numerous O
mischances O
, O
into O
poverty O
. O
This O
man O
, O
whose O
name O
was O
Beaufort O
, O
was O
of O
a O
proud O
and O
unbending O
disposition O
, O
and O
could O
not O
bear O
to O
live O
in O
poverty O
and O
oblivion O
in O
the O
same O
country O
where O
he O
had O
formerly O
been O
distinguished O
for O
his O
rank O
and O
magnificence O
. O
Having O
paid O
his O
debts O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
the O
most O
honourable O
manner O
, O
he O
retreated O
with O
his O
daughter O
to O
the O
town O
of O
Lucerne O
, O
where O
he O
lived O
unknown O
and O
in O
wretchedness O
. O
My O
father O
loved O
Beaufort O
with O
the O
truest O
friendship O
, O
and O
was O
deeply O
grieved O
by O
his O
retreat O
in O
these O
unfortunate O
circumstances O
. O
He O
bitterly O
deplored O
the O
false O
pride O
which O
led O
his O
friend O
to O
a O
conduct O
so O
little O
worthy O
of O
the O
affection O
that O
united O
them O
. O
He O
lost O
no O
time O
in O
endeavouring O
to O
seek O
him O
out O
, O
with O
the O
hope O
of O
persuading O
him O
to O
begin O
the O
world O
again O
through O
his O
credit O
and O
assistance O
. O
Beaufort O
had O
taken O
effectual O
measures O
to O
conceal O
himself O
; O
and O
it O
was O
ten O
months O
before O
my O
father O
discovered O
his O
abode O
. O
Overjoyed O
at O
this O
discovery O
, O
he O
hastened O
to O
the O
house O
, O
which O
was O
situated O
in O
a O
mean O
street O
, O
near O
the O
Reuss O
. O
But O
when O
he O
entered O
, O
misery O
and O
despair O
alone O
welcomed O
him O
. O
Beaufort O
had O
saved O
but O
a O
very O
small O
sum O
of O
money O
from O
the O
wreck O
of O
his O
fortunes O
; O
but O
it O
was O
sufficient O
to O
provide O
him O
with O
sustenance O
for O
some O
months O
, O
and O
in O
the O
mean O
time O
he O
hoped O
to O
procure O
some O
respectable O
employment O
in O
a O
merchant O
's O
house O
. O
The O
interval O
was O
, O
consequently O
, O
spent O
in O
inaction O
; O
his O
grief O
only O
became O
more O
deep O
and O
rankling O
, O
when O
he O
had O
leisure O
for O
reflection O
; O
and O
at O
length O
it O
took O
so O
fast O
hold O
of O
his O
mind O
, O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
three O
months O
he O
lay O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
sickness O
, O
incapable O
of O
any O
exertion O
. O
His O
daughter O
attended O
him O
with O
the O
greatest O
tenderness O
; O
but O
she O
saw O
with O
despair O
that O
their O
little O
fund O
was O
rapidly O
decreasing O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
other O
prospect O
of O
support O
. O
But O
Caroline O
Beaufort O
possessed O
a O
mind O
of O
an O
uncommon O
mould O
; O
and O
her O
courage O
rose O
to O
support O
her O
in O
her O
adversity O
. O
She O
procured O
plain O
work O
; O
she O
plaited O
straw O
; O
and O
by O
various O
means O
contrived O
to O
earn O
a O
pittance O
scarcely O
sufficient O
to O
support O
life O
. O
Several O
months O
passed O
in O
this O
manner O
. O
Her O
father O
grew O
worse O
; O
her O
time O
was O
more O
entirely O
occupied O
in O
attending O
him O
; O
her O
means O
of O
subsistence O
decreased O
; O
and O
in O
the O
tenth O
month O
her O
father O
died O
in O
her O
arms O
, O
leaving O
her O
an O
orphan O
and O
a O
beggar O
. O
This O
last O
blow O
overcame O
her O
; O
and O
she O
knelt O
by O
Beaufort O
's O
coffin O
, O
weeping O
bitterly O
, O
when O
my O
father O
entered O
the O
chamber O
. O
He O
came O
like O
a O
protecting O
spirit O
to O
the O
poor O
girl O
, O
who O
committed O
herself O
to O
his O
care O
; O
and O
after O
the O
interment O
of O
his O
friend O
, O
he O
conducted O
her O
to O
Geneva O
, O
and O
placed O
her O
under O
the O
protection O
of O
a O
relation O
. O
Two O
years O
after O
this O
event O
Caroline O
became O
his O
wife O
. O
There O
was O
a O
considerable O
difference O
between O
the O
ages O
of O
my O
parents O
, O
but O
this O
circumstance O
seemed O
to O
unite O
them O
only O
closer O
in O
bonds O
of O
devoted O
affection O
. O
There O
was O
a O
sense O
of O
justice O
in O
my O
father O
's O
upright O
mind O
, O
which O
rendered O
it O
necessary O
that O
he O
should O
approve O
highly O
to O
love O
strongly O
. O
Perhaps O
during O
former O
years O
he O
had O
suffered O
from O
the O
late-discovered O
unworthiness O
of O
one O
beloved O
, O
and O
so O
was O
disposed O
to O
set O
a O
greater O
value O
on O
tried O
worth O
. O
There O
was O
a O
show O
of O
gratitude O
and O
worship O
in O
his O
attachment O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
differing O
wholly O
from O
the O
doating O
fondness O
of O
age O
, O
for O
it O
was O
inspired O
by O
reverence O
for O
her O
virtues O
, O
and O
a O
desire O
to O
be O
the O
means O
of O
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
recompensing O
her O
for O
the O
sorrows O
she O
had O
endured O
, O
but O
which O
gave O
inexpressible O
grace O
to O
his O
behaviour O
to O
her O
. O
Every O
thing O
was O
made O
to O
yield O
to O
her O
wishes O
and O
her O
convenience O
. O
He O
strove O
to O
shelter O
her O
, O
as O
a O
fair O
exotic O
is O
sheltered O
by O
the O
gardener O
, O
from O
every O
rougher O
wind O
, O
and O
to O
surround O
her O
with O
all O
that O
could O
tend O
to O
excite O
pleasurable O
emotion O
in O
her O
soft O
and O
benevolent O
mind O
. O
Her O
health O
, O
and O
even O
the O
tranquillity O
of O
her O
hitherto O
constant O
spirit O
, O
had O
been O
shaken O
by O
what O
she O
had O
gone O
through O
. O
During O
the O
two O
years O
that O
had O
elapsed O
previous O
to O
their O
marriage O
my O
father O
had O
gradually O
relinquished O
all O
his O
public O
functions O
; O
and O
immediately O
after O
their O
union O
they O
sought O
the O
pleasant O
climate O
of O
Italy O
, O
and O
the O
change O
of O
scene O
and O
interest O
attendant O
on O
a O
tour O
through O
that O
land O
of O
wonders O
, O
as O
a O
restorative O
for O
her O
weakened O
frame O
. O
From O
Italy O
they O
visited O
Germany O
and O
France O
. O
I O
, O
their O
eldest O
child O
, O
was O
born O
at O
Naples O
, O
and O
as O
an O
infant O
accompanied O
them O
in O
their O
rambles O
. O
I O
remained O
for O
several O
years O
their O
only O
child O
. O
Much O
as O
they O
were O
attached O
to O
each O
other O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
draw O
inexhaustible O
stores O
of O
affection O
from O
a O
very O
mine O
of O
love O
to O
bestow O
them O
upon O
me O
. O
My O
mother O
's O
tender O
caresses O
, O
and O
my O
father O
's O
smile O
of O
benevolent O
pleasure O
while O
regarding O
me O
, O
are O
my O
first O
recollections O
. O
I O
was O
their O
plaything O
and O
their O
idol O
, O
and O
something O
better—their O
child O
, O
the O
innocent O
and O
helpless O
creature O
bestowed O
on O
them O
by O
Heaven O
, O
whom O
to O
bring O
up O
to O
good O
, O
and O
whose O
future O
lot O
it O
was O
in O
their O
hands O
to O
direct O
to O
happiness O
or O
misery O
, O
according O
as O
they O
fulfilled O
their O
duties O
towards O
me O
. O
With O
this O
deep O
consciousness O
of O
what O
they O
owed O
towards O
the O
being O
to O
which O
they O
had O
given O
life O
, O
added O
to O
the O
active O
spirit O
of O
tenderness O
that O
animated O
both O
, O
it O
may O
be O
imagined O
that O
while O
during O
every O
hour O
of O
my O
infant O
life O
I O
received O
a O
lesson O
of O
patience O
, O
of O
charity O
, O
and O
of O
self-control O
, O
I O
was O
so O
guided O
by O
a O
silken O
cord O
, O
that O
all O
seemed O
but O
one O
train O
of O
enjoyment O
to O
me O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
was O
their O
only O
care O
. O
My O
mother O
had O
much O
desire O
to O
have O
a O
daughter O
, O
but O
I O
continued O
their O
single O
offspring O
. O
When O
I O
was O
about O
five O
years O
old O
, O
while O
making O
an O
excursion O
beyond O
the O
frontiers O
of O
Italy O
, O
they O
passed O
a O
week O
on O
the O
shores O
of O
the O
Lake O
of O
Como O
. O
Their O
benevolent O
disposition O
often O
made O
them O
enter O
the O
cottages O
of O
the O
poor O
. O
This O
, O
to O
my O
mother O
, O
was O
more O
than O
a O
duty O
; O
it O
was O
a O
necessity O
, O
a O
passion O
, O
—remembering O
what O
she O
had O
suffered O
, O
and O
how O
she O
had O
been O
relieved O
, O
—for O
her O
to O
act O
in O
her O
turn O
the O
guardian O
angel O
to O
the O
afflicted O
. O
During O
one O
of O
their O
walks O
a O
poor O
cot O
in O
the O
foldings O
of O
a O
vale O
attracted O
their O
notice O
, O
as O
being O
singularly O
disconsolate O
, O
while O
the O
number O
of O
half-clothed O
children O
gathered O
about O
it O
, O
spoke O
of O
penury O
in O
its O
worst O
shape O
. O
One O
day O
, O
when O
my O
father O
had O
gone O
by O
himself O
to O
Milan O
, O
my O
mother O
, O
accompanied O
by O
me O
, O
visited O
this O
abode O
. O
She O
found O
a O
peasant O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
hard O
working O
, O
bent O
down O
by O
care O
and O
labour O
, O
distributing O
a O
scanty O
meal O
to O
five O
hungry O
babes O
. O
Among O
these O
there O
was O
one O
which O
attracted O
my O
mother O
far O
above O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
She O
appeared O
of O
a O
different O
stock O
. O
The O
four O
others O
were O
dark-eyed O
, O
hardy O
little O
vagrants O
; O
this O
child O
was O
thin O
, O
and O
very O
fair O
. O
Her O
hair O
was O
the O
brightest O
living O
gold O
, O
and O
, O
despite O
the O
poverty O
of O
her O
clothing O
, O
seemed O
to O
set O
a O
crown O
of O
distinction O
on O
her O
head O
. O
Her O
brow O
was O
clear O
and O
ample O
, O
her O
blue O
eyes O
cloudless O
, O
and O
her O
lips O
and O
the O
moulding O
of O
her O
face O
so O
expressive O
of O
sensibility O
and O
sweetness O
, O
that O
none O
could O
behold O
her O
without O
looking O
on O
her O
as O
of O
a O
distinct O
species O
, O
a O
being O
heaven-sent O
, O
and O
bearing O
a O
celestial O
stamp O
in O
all O
her O
features O
. O
The O
peasant O
woman O
, O
perceiving O
that O
my O
mother O
fixed O
eyes O
of O
wonder O
and O
admiration O
on O
this O
lovely O
girl O
, O
eagerly O
communicated O
her O
history O
. O
She O
was O
not O
her O
child O
, O
but O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
Milanese O
nobleman O
. O
Her O
mother O
was O
a O
German O
, O
and O
had O
died O
on O
giving O
her O
birth O
. O
The O
infant O
had O
been O
placed O
with O
these O
good O
people O
to O
nurse O
: O
they O
were O
better O
off O
then O
. O
They O
had O
not O
been O
long O
married O
, O
and O
their O
eldest O
child O
was O
but O
just O
born O
. O
The O
father O
of O
their O
charge O
was O
one O
of O
those O
Italians O
nursed O
in O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
antique O
glory O
of O
Italy O
, O
—one O
among O
the O
schiavi O
ognor O
frementi O
, O
who O
exerted O
himself O
to O
obtain O
the O
liberty O
of O
his O
country O
. O
He O
became O
the O
victim O
of O
its O
weakness O
. O
Whether O
he O
had O
died O
, O
or O
still O
lingered O
in O
the O
dungeons O
of O
Austria O
, O
was O
not O
known O
. O
His O
property O
was O
confiscated O
, O
his O
child O
became O
an O
orphan O
and O
a O
beggar O
. O
She O
continued O
with O
her O
foster O
parents O
, O
and O
bloomed O
in O
their O
rude O
abode O
, O
fairer O
than O
a O
garden O
rose O
among O
dark-leaved O
brambles O
. O
When O
my O
father O
returned O
from O
Milan O
, O
he O
found O
playing O
with O
me O
in O
the O
hall O
of O
our O
villa O
, O
a O
child O
fairer O
than O
pictured O
cherub—a O
creature O
who O
seemed O
to O
shed O
radiance O
from O
her O
looks O
, O
and O
whose O
form O
and O
motions O
were O
lighter O
than O
the O
chamois O
of O
the O
hills O
. O
The O
apparition O
was O
soon O
explained O
. O
With O
his O
permission O
my O
mother O
prevailed O
on O
her O
rustic O
guardians O
to O
yield O
their O
charge O
to O
her O
. O
They O
were O
fond O
of O
the O
sweet O
orphan O
. O
Her O
presence O
had O
seemed O
a O
blessing O
to O
them O
; O
but O
it O
would O
be O
unfair O
to O
her O
to O
keep O
her O
in O
poverty O
and O
want O
, O
when O
Providence O
afforded O
her O
such O
powerful O
protection O
. O
They O
consulted O
their O
village O
priest O
, O
and O
the O
result O
was O
, O
that O
Elizabeth O
Lavenza O
became O
the O
inmate O
of O
my O
parents O
' O
house—my O
more O
than O
sister—the O
beautiful O
and O
adored O
companion O
of O
all O
my O
occupations O
and O
my O
pleasures O
. O
Every O
one O
loved O
Elizabeth O
. O
The O
passionate O
and O
almost O
reverential O
attachment O
with O
which O
all O
regarded O
her O
became O
, O
while O
I O
shared O
it O
, O
my O
pride O
and O
my O
delight O
. O
On O
the O
evening O
previous O
to O
her O
being O
brought O
to O
my O
home O
, O
my O
mother O
had O
said O
playfully O
, O
— O
" O
I O
have O
a O
pretty O
present O
for O
my O
Victor—to-morrow O
he O
shall O
have O
it O
. O
" O
And O
when O
, O
on O
the O
morrow O
, O
she O
presented O
Elizabeth O
to O
me O
as O
her O
promised O
gift O
, O
I O
, O
with O
childish O
seriousness O
, O
interpreted O
her O
words O
literally O
, O
and O
looked O
upon O
Elizabeth O
as O
mine—mine O
to O
protect O
, O
love O
, O
and O
cherish O
. O
All O
praises O
bestowed O
on O
her O
, O
I O
received O
as O
made O
to O
a O
possession O
of O
my O
own O
. O
We O
called O
each O
other O
familiarly O
by O
the O
name O
of O
cousin O
. O
No O
word O
, O
no O
expression O
could O
body O
forth O
the O
kind O
of O
relation O
in O
which O
she O
stood O
to O
me—my O
more O
than O
sister O
, O
since O
till O
death O
she O
was O
to O
be O
mine O
only O
. O
