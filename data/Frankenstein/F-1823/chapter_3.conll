MY O
DEAR O
SISTER O
, O
I O
WRITE O
a O
few O
lines O
in O
haste O
, O
to O
say O
that O
I O
am O
safe O
, O
and O
well O
advanced O
on O
my O
voyage O
. O
This O
letter O
will O
reach O
England O
by O
a O
merchant-man O
now O
on O
its O
homeward O
voyage O
from O
Archangel O
; O
more O
fortunate O
than O
I O
, O
who O
may O
not O
see O
my O
native O
land O
, O
perhaps O
, O
for O
many O
years O
. O
I O
am O
, O
however O
, O
in O
good O
spirits O
: O
my O
men O
are O
bold O
, O
and O
apparently O
firm O
of O
purpose O
; O
nor O
do O
the O
floating O
sheets O
of O
ice O
that O
continually O
pass O
us O
, O
indicating O
the O
dangers O
of O
the O
region O
towards O
which O
we O
are O
advancing O
, O
appear O
to O
dismay O
them O
. O
We O
have O
already O
reached O
a O
very O
high O
latitude O
; O
but O
it O
is O
the O
height O
of O
summer O
, O
and O
although O
not O
so O
warm O
as O
in O
England O
, O
the O
southern O
gales O
, O
which O
blow O
us O
speedily O
towards O
those O
shores O
which O
I O
so O
ardently O
desire O
to O
attain O
, O
breathe O
a O
degree O
of O
renovating O
warmth O
which O
I O
had O
not O
expected O
. O
No O
incidents O
have O
hitherto O
befallen O
us O
that O
would O
make O
a O
figure O
in O
a O
letter O
. O
One O
or O
two O
stiff O
gales O
, O
and O
the O
breaking O
of O
a O
mast O
, O
are O
accidents O
which O
experienced O
navigators O
scarcely O
remember O
to O
record O
; O
and O
I O
shall O
be O
well O
content O
if O
nothing O
worse O
happen O
to O
us O
during O
our O
voyage O
. O
Adieu O
, O
my O
dear O
Margaret O
. O
Be O
assured O
, O
that O
for O
my O
own O
sake O
, O
as O
well O
as O
yours O
, O
I O
will O
not O
rashly O
encounter O
danger O
. O
I O
will O
be O
cool O
, O
persevering O
, O
and O
prudent O
. O
Remember O
me O
to O
all O
my O
English O
friends O
. O
Most O
affectionately O
yours O
, O
R. O
W O
