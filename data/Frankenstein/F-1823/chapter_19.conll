CURSED O
, O
cursed O
creator O
! O
Why O
did O
I O
live O
? O
Why O
, O
in O
that O
instant O
, O
did O
I O
not O
extinguish O
the O
spark O
of O
existence O
which O
you O
had O
so O
wantonly O
bestowed O
? O
I O
know O
not O
; O
despair O
had O
not O
yet O
taken O
possession O
of O
me O
; O
my O
feelings O
were O
those O
of O
rage O
and O
revenge O
. O
I O
could O
with O
pleasure O
have O
destroyed O
the O
cottage O
and O
its O
inhabitants O
, O
and O
have O
glutted O
myself O
with O
their O
shrieks O
and O
misery O
. O
" O
When O
night O
came O
, O
I O
quitted O
my O
retreat O
, O
and O
wandered O
in O
the O
wood O
; O
and O
now O
, O
no O
longer O
restrained O
by O
the O
fear O
of O
discovery O
, O
I O
gave O
vent O
to O
my O
anguish O
in O
fearful O
howlings O
. O
I O
was O
like O
a O
wild O
beast O
that O
had O
broken O
the O
toils O
; O
destroying O
the O
objects O
that O
obstructed O
me O
, O
and O
ranging O
through O
the O
wood O
with O
a O
stag-like O
swiftness O
. O
Oh O
! O
what O
a O
miserable O
night O
I O
passed O
! O
the O
cold O
stars O
shone O
in O
mockery O
, O
and O
the O
bare O
trees O
waved O
their O
branches O
above O
me O
: O
now O
and O
then O
the O
sweet O
voice O
of O
a O
bird O
burst O
forth O
amidst O
the O
universal O
stillness O
. O
All O
, O
save O
I O
, O
were O
at O
rest O
or O
in O
enjoyment O
: O
I O
, O
like O
the O
arch O
fiend O
, O
bore O
a O
hell O
within O
me O
; O
and O
, O
finding O
myself O
unsympathized O
with O
, O
wished O
to O
tear O
up O
the O
trees O
, O
spread O
havoc O
and O
destruction O
around O
me O
, O
and O
then O
to O
have O
sat O
down O
and O
enjoyed O
the O
ruin O
. O
" O
But O
this O
was O
a O
luxury O
of O
sensation O
that O
could O
not O
endure O
; O
I O
became O
fatigued O
with O
excess O
of O
bodily O
exertion O
, O
and O
sank O
on O
the O
damp O
grass O
in O
the O
sick O
impotence O
of O
despair O
. O
There O
was O
none O
among O
the O
myriads O
of O
men O
that O
existed O
who O
would O
pity O
or O
assist O
me O
; O
and O
should O
I O
feel O
kindness O
towards O
my O
enemies O
? O
No O
: O
from O
that O
moment O
I O
declared O
everlasting O
war O
against O
the O
species O
, O
and O
, O
more O
than O
all O
, O
against O
him O
who O
had O
formed O
me O
, O
and O
sent O
me O
forth O
to O
this O
insupportable O
misery O
. O
" O
The O
sun O
rose O
; O
I O
heard O
the O
voices O
of O
men O
, O
and O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
return O
to O
my O
retreat O
during O
that O
day O
. O
Accordingly O
I O
hid O
myself O
in O
some O
thick O
underwood O
, O
determining O
to O
devote O
the O
ensuing O
hours O
to O
reflection O
on O
my O
situation O
. O
" O
The O
pleasant O
sunshine O
, O
and O
the O
pure O
air O
of O
day O
, O
restored O
me O
to O
some O
degree O
of O
tranquillity O
; O
and O
when O
I O
considered O
what O
had O
passed O
at O
the O
cottage O
, O
I O
could O
not O
help O
believing O
that O
I O
had O
been O
too O
hasty O
in O
my O
conclusions O
. O
I O
had O
certainly O
acted O
imprudently O
. O
It O
was O
apparent O
that O
my O
conversation O
had O
interested O
the O
father O
in O
my O
behalf O
, O
and O
I O
was O
a O
fool O
in O
having O
exposed O
my O
person O
to O
the O
horror O
of O
his O
children O
. O
I O
ought O
to O
have O
familiarized O
the O
old O
De O
Lacey O
to O
me O
, O
and O
by O
degrees O
to O
have O
discovered O
myself O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
family O
, O
when O
they O
should O
have O
been O
prepared O
for O
my O
approach O
. O
But O
I O
did O
not O
believe O
my O
errors O
to O
be O
irretrievable O
; O
and O
, O
after O
much O
consideration O
, O
I O
resolved O
to O
return O
to O
the O
cottage O
, O
seek O
the O
old O
man O
, O
and O
by O
my O
representations O
win O
him O
to O
my O
party O
. O
" O
These O
thoughts O
calmed O
me O
, O
and O
in O
the O
afternoon O
I O
sank O
into O
a O
profound O
sleep O
; O
but O
the O
fever O
of O
my O
blood O
did O
not O
allow O
me O
to O
be O
visited O
by O
peaceful O
dreams O
. O
The O
horrible O
scene O
of O
the O
preceding O
day O
was O
for O
ever O
acting O
before O
my O
eyes O
; O
the O
females O
were O
flying O
, O
and O
the O
enraged O
Felix O
tearing O
me O
from O
his O
father O
's O
feet O
. O
I O
awoke O
exhausted O
; O
and O
, O
finding O
that O
it O
was O
already O
night O
, O
I O
crept O
forth O
from O
my O
hiding-place O
, O
and O
went O
in O
search O
of O
food O
. O
" O
When O
my O
hunger O
was O
appeased O
, O
I O
directed O
my O
steps O
towards O
the O
well-known O
path O
that O
conducted O
to O
the O
cottage O
. O
All O
there O
was O
at O
peace O
. O
I O
crept O
into O
my O
hovel O
, O
and O
remained O
in O
silent O
expectation O
of O
the O
accustomed O
hour O
when O
the O
family O
arose O
. O
That O
hour O
past O
, O
the O
sun O
mounted O
high O
in O
the O
heavens O
, O
but O
the O
cottagers O
did O
not O
appear O
. O
I O
trembled O
violently O
, O
apprehending O
some O
dreadful O
misfortune O
. O
The O
inside O
of O
the O
cottage O
was O
dark O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
no O
motion O
; O
I O
can O
not O
describe O
the O
agony O
of O
this O
suspense O
. O
" O
Presently O
two O
countrymen O
passed O
by O
; O
but O
, O
pausing O
near O
the O
cottage O
, O
they O
entered O
into O
conversation O
, O
using O
violent O
gesticulations O
; O
but O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
they O
said O
, O
as O
they O
spoke O
the O
language O
of O
the O
country O
, O
which O
differed O
from O
that O
of O
my O
protectors O
. O
Soon O
after O
, O
however O
, O
Felix O
approached O
with O
another O
man O
: O
I O
was O
surprised O
, O
as O
I O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
not O
quitted O
the O
cottage O
that O
morning O
, O
and O
waited O
anxiously O
to O
discover O
, O
from O
his O
discourse O
, O
the O
meaning O
of O
these O
unusual O
appearances O
. O
" O
'Do O
you O
consider O
, O
' O
said O
his O
companion O
to O
him O
, O
'that O
you O
will O
be O
obliged O
to O
pay O
three O
months O
' O
rent O
, O
and O
to O
lose O
the O
produce O
of O
your O
garden O
? O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
take O
any O
unfair O
advantage O
, O
and O
I O
beg O
therefore O
that O
you O
will O
take O
some O
days O
to O
consider O
of O
your O
determination O
. O
' O
" O
'It O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
' O
replied O
Felix O
, O
'we O
can O
never O
again O
inhabit O
your O
cottage O
. O
The O
life O
of O
my O
father O
is O
in O
the O
greatest O
danger O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
dreadful O
circumstance O
that O
I O
have O
related O
. O
My O
wife O
and O
my O
sister O
will O
never O
recover O
their O
horror O
. O
I O
entreat O
you O
not O
to O
reason O
with O
me O
any O
more O
. O
Take O
possession O
of O
your O
tenement O
, O
and O
let O
me O
fly O
from O
this O
place O
. O
' O
" O
Felix O
trembled O
violently O
as O
he O
said O
this O
. O
He O
and O
his O
companion O
entered O
the O
cottage O
, O
in O
which O
they O
remained O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
and O
then O
departed O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
any O
of O
the O
family O
of O
De O
Lacey O
more O
. O
" O
I O
continued O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
day O
in O
my O
hovel O
in O
a O
state O
of O
utter O
and O
stupid O
despair O
. O
My O
protectors O
had O
departed O
, O
and O
had O
broken O
the O
only O
link O
that O
held O
me O
to O
the O
world O
. O
For O
the O
first O
time O
the O
feelings O
of O
revenge O
and O
hatred O
filled O
my O
bosom O
, O
and O
I O
did O
not O
strive O
to O
control O
them O
; O
but O
, O
allowing O
myself O
to O
be O
borne O
away O
by O
the O
stream O
, O
I O
bent O
my O
mind O
towards O
injury O
and O
death O
. O
When O
I O
thought O
of O
my O
friends O
, O
of O
the O
mild O
voice O
of O
De O
Lacey O
, O
the O
gentle O
eyes O
of O
Agatha O
, O
and O
the O
exquisite O
beauty O
of O
the O
Arabian O
, O
these O
thoughts O
vanished O
, O
and O
a O
gush O
of O
tears O
somewhat O
soothed O
me O
. O
But O
again O
, O
when O
I O
reflected O
that O
they O
had O
spurned O
and O
deserted O
me O
, O
anger O
returned O
, O
a O
rage O
of O
anger O
; O
and O
, O
unable O
to O
injure O
any O
thing O
human O
, O
I O
turned O
my O
fury O
towards O
inanimate O
objects O
. O
As O
night O
advanced O
, O
I O
placed O
a O
variety O
of O
combustibles O
around O
the O
cottage O
; O
and O
, O
after O
having O
destroyed O
every O
vestige O
of O
cultivation O
in O
the O
garden O
, O
I O
waited O
with O
forced O
impatience O
until O
the O
moon O
had O
sunk O
to O
commence O
my O
operations O
. O
" O
As O
the O
night O
advanced O
, O
a O
fierce O
wind O
arose O
from O
the O
woods O
, O
and O
quickly O
dispersed O
the O
clouds O
that O
had O
loitered O
in O
the O
heavens O
: O
the O
blast O
tore O
along O
like O
a O
mighty O
avelânche O
, O
and O
produced O
a O
kind O
of O
insanity O
in O
my O
spirits O
, O
that O
burst O
all O
bounds O
of O
reason O
and O
reflection O
. O
I O
lighted O
the O
dry O
branch O
of O
a O
tree O
, O
and O
danced O
with O
fury O
around O
the O
devoted O
cottage O
, O
my O
eyes O
still O
fixed O
on O
the O
western O
horizon O
, O
the O
edge O
of O
which O
the O
moon O
nearly O
touched O
. O
A O
part O
of O
its O
orb O
was O
at O
length O
hid O
, O
and O
I O
waved O
my O
brand O
; O
it O
sunk O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
loud O
scream O
, O
I O
fired O
the O
straw O
, O
and O
heath O
, O
and O
bushes O
, O
which O
I O
had O
collected O
. O
The O
wind O
fanned O
the O
fire O
, O
and O
the O
cottage O
was O
quickly O
enveloped O
by O
the O
flames O
, O
which O
clung O
to O
it O
, O
and O
licked O
it O
with O
their O
forked O
and O
destroying O
tongues O
. O
" O
As O
soon O
as O
I O
was O
convinced O
that O
no O
assistance O
could O
save O
any O
part O
of O
the O
habitation O
, O
I O
quitted O
the O
scene O
, O
and O
sought O
for O
refuge O
in O
the O
woods O
. O
" O
And O
now O
, O
with O
the O
world O
before O
me O
, O
whither O
should O
I O
bend O
my O
steps O
? O
I O
resolved O
to O
fly O
far O
from O
the O
scene O
of O
my O
misfortunes O
; O
but O
to O
me O
, O
hated O
and O
despised O
, O
every O
country O
must O
be O
equally O
horrible O
. O
At O
length O
the O
thought O
of O
you O
crossed O
my O
mind O
. O
I O
learned O
from O
your O
papers O
that O
you O
were O
my O
father O
, O
my O
creator O
; O
and O
to O
whom O
could O
I O
apply O
with O
more O
fitness O
than O
to O
him O
who O
had O
given O
me O
life O
? O
Among O
the O
lessons O
that O
Felix O
had O
bestowed O
upon O
Safie O
geography O
had O
not O
been O
omitted O
: O
I O
had O
learned O
from O
these O
the O
relative O
situations O
of O
the O
different O
countries O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
You O
had O
mentioned O
Geneva O
as O
the O
name O
of O
your O
native O
town O
; O
and O
towards O
this O
place O
I O
resolved O
to O
proceed O
. O
" O
But O
how O
was O
I O
to O
direct O
myself O
? O
I O
knew O
that O
I O
must O
travel O
in O
a O
south-westerly O
direction O
to O
reach O
my O
destination O
; O
but O
the O
sun O
was O
my O
only O
guide O
. O
I O
did O
not O
know O
the O
names O
of O
the O
towns O
that O
I O
was O
to O
pass O
through O
, O
nor O
could O
I O
ask O
information O
from O
a O
single O
human O
being O
; O
but O
I O
did O
not O
despair O
. O
From O
you O
only O
could O
I O
hope O
for O
succour O
, O
although O
towards O
you O
I O
felt O
no O
sentiment O
but O
that O
of O
hatred O
. O
Unfeeling O
, O
heartless O
creator O
! O
you O
had O
endowed O
me O
with O
perceptions O
and O
passions O
, O
and O
then O
cast O
me O
abroad O
an O
object O
for O
the O
scorn O
and O
horror O
of O
mankind O
. O
But O
on O
you O
only O
had O
I O
any O
claim O
for O
pity O
and O
redress O
, O
and O
from O
you O
I O
determined O
to O
seek O
that O
justice O
which O
I O
vainly O
attempted O
to O
gain O
from O
any O
other O
being O
that O
wore O
the O
human O
form O
. O
" O
My O
travels O
were O
long O
, O
and O
the O
sufferings O
I O
endured O
intense O
. O
It O
was O
late O
in O
autumn O
when O
I O
quitted O
the O
district O
where O
I O
had O
so O
long O
resided O
. O
I O
travelled O
only O
at O
night O
, O
fearful O
of O
encountering O
the O
visage O
of O
a O
human O
being O
. O
Nature O
decayed O
around O
me O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
became O
heatless O
; O
rain O
and O
snow O
poured O
around O
me O
; O
mighty O
rivers O
were O
frozen O
; O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
earth O
was O
hard O
, O
and O
chill O
, O
and O
bare O
, O
and O
I O
found O
no O
shelter O
. O
Oh O
, O
earth O
! O
how O
often O
did O
I O
imprecate O
curses O
on O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
being O
! O
The O
mildness O
of O
my O
nature O
had O
fled O
, O
and O
all O
within O
me O
was O
turned O
to O
gall O
and O
bitterness O
. O
The O
nearer O
I O
approached O
to O
your O
habitation O
, O
the O
more O
deeply O
did O
I O
feel O
the O
spirit O
of O
revenge O
enkindled O
in O
my O
heart O
. O
Snow O
fell O
, O
and O
the O
waters O
were O
hardened O
, O
but O
I O
rested O
not O
. O
A O
few O
incidents O
now O
and O
then O
directed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
possessed O
a O
map O
of O
the O
country O
; O
but O
I O
often O
wandered O
wide O
from O
my O
path O
. O
The O
agony O
of O
my O
feelings O
allowed O
me O
no O
respite O
: O
no O
incident O
occurred O
from O
which O
my O
rage O
and O
misery O
could O
not O
extract O
its O
food O
; O
but O
a O
circumstance O
that O
happened O
when O
I O
arrived O
on O
the O
confines O
of O
Switzerland O
, O
when O
the O
sun O
had O
recovered O
its O
warmth O
, O
and O
the O
earth O
again O
began O
to O
look O
green O
, O
confirmed O
in O
an O
especial O
manner O
the O
bitterness O
and O
horror O
of O
my O
feelings O
. O
" O
I O
generally O
rested O
during O
the O
day O
, O
and O
travelled O
only O
when O
I O
was O
secured O
by O
night O
from O
the O
view O
of O
man O
. O
One O
morning O
, O
however O
, O
finding O
that O
my O
path O
lay O
through O
a O
deep O
wood O
, O
I O
ventured O
to O
continue O
my O
journey O
after O
the O
sun O
had O
risen O
; O
the O
day O
, O
which O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
of O
spring O
, O
cheered O
even O
me O
by O
the O
loveliness O
of O
its O
sunshine O
and O
the O
balminess O
of O
the O
air O
. O
I O
felt O
emotions O
of O
gentleness O
and O
pleasure O
, O
that O
had O
long O
appeared O
dead O
, O
revive O
within O
me O
. O
Half O
surprised O
by O
the O
novelty O
of O
these O
sensations O
, O
I O
allowed O
myself O
to O
be O
borne O
away O
by O
them O
; O
and O
, O
forgetting O
my O
solitude O
and O
deformity O
, O
dared O
to O
be O
happy O
. O
Soft O
tears O
again O
bedewed O
my O
cheeks O
, O
and O
I O
even O
raised O
my O
humid O
eyes O
with O
thankfulness O
towards O
the O
blessed O
sun O
which O
bestowed O
such O
joy O
upon O
me O
. O
" O
I O
continued O
to O
wind O
among O
the O
paths O
of O
the O
wood O
, O
until O
I O
came O
to O
its O
boundary O
, O
which O
was O
skirted O
by O
a O
deep O
and O
rapid O
river O
, O
into O
which O
many O
of O
the O
trees O
bent O
their O
branches O
, O
now O
budding O
with O
the O
fresh O
spring O
. O
Here O
I O
paused O
, O
not O
exactly O
knowing O
what O
path O
to O
pursue O
, O
when O
I O
heard O
the O
sound O
of O
voices O
, O
that O
induced O
me O
to O
conceal O
myself O
under O
the O
shade O
of O
a O
cypress O
. O
I O
was O
scarcely O
hid O
, O
when O
a O
young O
girl O
came O
running O
towards O
the O
spot O
where O
I O
was O
concealed O
, O
laughing O
as O
if O
she O
ran O
from O
some O
one O
in O
sport O
. O
She O
continued O
her O
course O
along O
the O
precipitous O
sides O
of O
the O
river O
, O
when O
suddenly O
her O
foot O
slipt O
, O
and O
she O
fell O
into O
the O
rapid O
stream O
. O
I O
rushed O
from O
my O
hiding-place O
, O
and O
, O
with O
extreme O
labour O
from O
the O
force O
of O
the O
current O
, O
saved O
her O
, O
and O
dragged O
her O
to O
shore O
. O
She O
was O
senseless O
; O
and O
I O
endeavoured O
, O
by O
every O
means O
in O
my O
power O
, O
to O
restore O
animation O
, O
when O
I O
was O
suddenly O
interrupted O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
a O
rustic O
, O
who O
was O
probably O
the O
person O
from O
whom O
she O
had O
playfully O
fled O
. O
On O
seeing O
me O
, O
he O
darted O
towards O
me O
, O
and O
, O
tearing O
the O
girl O
from O
my O
arms O
, O
hastened O
towards O
the O
deeper O
parts O
of O
the O
wood O
. O
I O
followed O
speedily O
, O
I O
hardly O
knew O
why O
; O
but O
when O
the O
man O
saw O
me O
draw O
near O
, O
he O
aimed O
a O
gun O
, O
which O
he O
carried O
, O
at O
my O
body O
, O
and O
fired O
. O
I O
sunk O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
my O
injurer O
, O
with O
increased O
swiftness O
, O
escaped O
into O
the O
wood O
. O
" O
This O
was O
then O
the O
reward O
of O
my O
benevolence O
! O
I O
had O
saved O
a O
human O
being O
from O
destruction O
, O
and O
, O
as O
a O
recompense O
, O
I O
now O
writhed O
under O
the O
miserable O
pain O
of O
a O
wound O
, O
which O
shattered O
the O
flesh O
and O
bone O
. O
The O
feelings O
of O
kindness O
and O
gentleness O
, O
which O
I O
had O
entertained O
but O
a O
few O
moments O
before O
, O
gave O
place O
to O
hellish O
rage O
and O
gnashing O
of O
teeth O
. O
Inflamed O
by O
pain O
, O
I O
vowed O
eternal O
hatred O
and O
vengeance O
to O
all O
mankind O
. O
But O
the O
agony O
of O
my O
wound O
overcame O
me O
; O
my O
pulses O
paused O
, O
and O
I O
fainted O
. O
" O
For O
some O
weeks O
I O
led O
a O
miserable O
life O
in O
the O
woods O
, O
endeavouring O
to O
cure O
the O
wound O
which O
I O
had O
received O
. O
The O
ball O
had O
entered O
my O
shoulder O
, O
and O
I O
knew O
not O
whether O
it O
had O
remained O
there O
or O
passed O
through O
; O
at O
any O
rate O
I O
had O
no O
means O
of O
extracting O
it O
. O
My O
sufferings O
were O
augmented O
also O
by O
the O
oppressive O
sense O
of O
the O
injustice O
and O
ingratitude O
of O
their O
infliction O
. O
My O
daily O
vows O
rose O
for O
revenge—a O
deep O
and O
deadly O
revenge O
, O
such O
as O
would O
alone O
compensate O
for O
the O
outrages O
and O
anguish O
I O
had O
endured O
. O
" O
After O
some O
weeks O
my O
wound O
healed O
, O
and O
I O
continued O
my O
journey O
. O
The O
labours O
I O
endured O
were O
no O
longer O
to O
be O
alleviated O
by O
the O
bright O
sun O
or O
gentle O
breezes O
of O
spring O
; O
all O
joy O
was O
but O
a O
mockery O
, O
which O
insulted O
my O
desolate O
state O
, O
and O
made O
me O
feel O
more O
painfully O
that O
I O
was O
not O
made O
for O
the O
enjoyment O
of O
pleasure O
. O
" O
But O
my O
toils O
now O
drew O
near O
a O
close O
; O
and O
, O
in O
two O
months O
from O
this O
time O
, O
I O
reached O
the O
environs O
of O
Geneva O
. O
" O
It O
was O
evening O
when O
I O
arrived O
, O
and O
I O
retired O
to O
a O
hiding-place O
among O
the O
fields O
that O
surround O
it O
, O
to O
meditate O
in O
what O
manner O
I O
should O
apply O
to O
you O
. O
I O
was O
oppressed O
by O
fatigue O
and O
hunger O
, O
and O
far O
too O
unhappy O
to O
enjoy O
the O
gentle O
breezes O
of O
evening O
, O
or O
the O
prospect O
of O
the O
sun O
setting O
behind O
the O
stupendous O
mountains O
of O
Jura O
. O
" O
At O
this O
time O
a O
slight O
sleep O
relieved O
me O
from O
the O
pain O
of O
reflection O
, O
which O
was O
disturbed O
by O
the O
approach O
of O
a O
beautiful O
child O
, O
who O
came O
running O
into O
the O
recess O
I O
had O
chosen O
, O
with O
all O
the O
sportiveness O
of O
infancy O
. O
Suddenly O
, O
as O
I O
gazed O
on O
him O
, O
an O
idea O
seized O
me O
, O
that O
this O
little O
creature O
was O
unprejudiced O
, O
and O
had O
lived O
too O
short O
a O
time O
to O
have O
imbibed O
a O
horror O
of O
deformity O
. O
If O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
could O
seize O
him O
, O
and O
educate O
him O
as O
my O
companion O
and O
friend O
, O
I O
should O
not O
be O
so O
desolate O
in O
this O
peopled O
earth O
. O
" O
Urged O
by O
this O
impulse O
, O
I O
seized O
on O
the O
boy O
as O
he O
passed O
, O
and O
drew O
him O
towards O
me O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
he O
beheld O
my O
form O
, O
he O
placed O
his O
hands O
before O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
uttered O
a O
shrill O
scream O
: O
I O
drew O
his O
hand O
forcibly O
from O
his O
face O
, O
and O
said O
, O
'Child O
, O
what O
is O
the O
meaning O
of O
this O
? O
I O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
hurt O
you O
; O
listen O
to O
me O
. O
' O
" O
He O
struggled O
violently O
; O
'Let O
me O
go O
, O
' O
he O
cried O
; O
'monster O
! O
ugly O
wretch O
! O
you O
wish O
to O
eat O
me O
, O
and O
tear O
me O
to O
pieces—You O
are O
an O
ogre—Let O
me O
go O
, O
or O
I O
will O
tell O
my O
papa O
. O
' O
" O
'Boy O
, O
you O
will O
never O
see O
your O
father O
again O
; O
you O
must O
come O
with O
me O
. O
' O
" O
'Hideous O
monster O
! O
let O
me O
go O
. O
My O
papa O
is O
a O
Syndic—he O
is O
M. O
Frankenstein—he O
will O
punish O
you O
. O
You O
dare O
not O
keep O
me O
. O
' O
" O
'Frankenstein O
! O
you O
belong O
then O
to O
my O
enemy—to O
him O
towards O
whom O
I O
have O
sworn O
eternal O
revenge O
; O
you O
shall O
be O
my O
first O
victim O
. O
' O
" O
The O
child O
still O
struggled O
, O
and O
loaded O
me O
with O
epithets O
which O
carried O
despair O
to O
my O
heart O
: O
I O
grasped O
his O
throat O
to O
silence O
him O
, O
and O
in O
a O
moment O
he O
lay O
dead O
at O
my O
feet O
. O
" O
I O
gazed O
on O
my O
victim O
, O
and O
my O
heart O
swelled O
with O
exultation O
and O
hellish O
triumph O
: O
clapping O
my O
hands O
, O
I O
exclaimed O
, O
' O
I O
, O
too O
, O
can O
create O
desolation O
; O
my O
enemy O
is O
not O
impregnable O
; O
this O
death O
will O
carry O
despair O
to O
him O
, O
and O
a O
thousand O
other O
miseries O
shall O
torment O
and O
destroy O
him O
. O
' O
" O
As O
I O
fixed O
my O
eyes O
on O
the O
child O
, O
I O
saw O
something O
glittering O
on O
his O
breast O
. O
I O
took O
it O
; O
it O
was O
a O
portrait O
of O
a O
most O
lovely O
woman O
. O
In O
spite O
of O
my O
malignity O
, O
it O
softened O
and O
attracted O
me O
. O
For O
a O
few O
moments O
I O
gazed O
with O
delight O
on O
her O
dark O
eyes O
, O
fringed O
by O
deep O
lashes O
, O
and O
her O
lovely O
lips O
; O
but O
presently O
my O
rage O
returned O
: O
I O
remembered O
that O
I O
was O
for O
ever O
deprived O
of O
the O
delights O
that O
such O
beautiful O
creatures O
could O
bestow O
; O
and O
that O
she O
whose O
resemblance O
I O
contemplated O
would O
, O
in O
regarding O
me O
, O
have O
changed O
that O
air O
of O
divine O
benignity O
to O
one O
expressive O
of O
disgust O
and O
affright O
. O
" O
Can O
you O
wonder O
that O
such O
thoughts O
transported O
me O
with O
rage O
? O
I O
only O
wonder O
that O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
instead O
of O
venting O
my O
sensations O
in O
exclamations O
and O
agony O
, O
I O
did O
not O
rush O
among O
mankind O
, O
and O
perish O
in O
the O
attempt O
to O
destroy O
them O
. O
" O
While O
I O
was O
overcome O
by O
these O
feelings O
, O
I O
left O
the O
spot O
where O
I O
had O
committed O
the O
murder O
, O
and O
was O
seeking O
a O
more O
secluded O
hiding-place O
, O
when O
I O
perceived O
a O
woman O
passing O
near O
me O
. O
She O
was O
young O
, O
not O
indeed O
so O
beautiful O
as O
her O
whose O
portrait O
I O
held O
, O
but O
of O
an O
agreeable O
aspect O
, O
and O
blooming O
in O
the O
loveliness O
of O
youth O
and O
health O
. O
Here O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
is O
one O
of O
those O
whose O
smiles O
are O
bestowed O
on O
all O
but O
me O
; O
she O
shall O
not O
escape O
: O
thanks O
to O
the O
lessons O
of O
Felix O
, O
and O
the O
sanguinary O
laws O
of O
man O
, O
I O
have O
learned O
how O
to O
work O
mischief O
. O
I O
approached O
her O
unperceived O
, O
and O
placed O
the O
portrait O
securely O
in O
one O
of O
the O
folds O
of O
her O
dress O
. O
" O
For O
some O
days O
I O
haunted O
the O
spot O
where O
these O
scenes O
had O
taken O
place O
; O
sometimes O
wishing O
to O
see O
you O
, O
sometimes O
resolved O
to O
quit O
the O
world O
and O
its O
miseries O
for O
ever O
. O
At O
length O
I O
wandered O
towards O
these O
mountains O
, O
and O
have O
ranged O
through O
their O
immense O
recesses O
, O
consumed O
by O
a O
burning O
passion O
which O
you O
alone O
can O
gratify O
. O
We O
may O
not O
part O
until O
you O
have O
promised O
to O
comply O
with O
my O
requisition O
. O
I O
am O
alone O
, O
and O
miserable O
; O
man O
will O
not O
associate O
with O
me O
; O
but O
one O
as O
deformed O
and O
horrible O
as O
myself O
would O
not O
deny O
herself O
to O
me O
. O
My O
companion O
must O
be O
of O
the O
same O
species O
, O
and O
have O
the O
same O
defects O
. O
This O
being O
you O
must O
create O
