Though O
, O
consumed O
with O
the O
hot O
fire O
of O
his O
purpose O
, O
Ahab O
in O
all O
his O
thoughts O
and O
actions O
ever O
had O
in O
view O
the O
ultimate O
capture O
of O
Moby O
Dick O
; O
though O
he O
seemed O
ready O
to O
sacrifice O
all O
mortal O
interests O
to O
that O
one O
passion O
; O
nevertheless O
it O
may O
have O
been O
that O
he O
was O
by O
nature O
and O
long O
habituation O
far O
too O
wedded O
to O
a O
fiery O
whaleman O
's O
ways O
, O
altogether O
to O
abandon O
the O
collateral O
prosecution O
of O
the O
voyage O
. O
Or O
at O
least O
if O
this O
were O
otherwise O
, O
there O
were O
not O
wanting O
other O
motives O
much O
more O
influential O
with O
him O
. O
It O
would O
be O
refining O
too O
much O
, O
perhaps O
, O
even O
considering O
his O
monomania O
, O
to O
hint O
that O
his O
vindictiveness O
towards O
the O
White O
Whale O
might O
have O
possibly O
extended O
itself O
in O
some O
degree O
to O
all O
sperm O
whales O
, O
and O
that O
the O
more O
monsters O
he O
slew O
by O
so O
much O
the O
more O
he O
multiplied O
the O
chances O
that O
each O
subsequently O
encountered O
whale O
would O
prove O
to O
be O
the O
hated O
one O
he O
hunted O
. O
But O
if O
such O
an O
hypothesis O
be O
indeed O
exceptionable O
, O
there O
were O
still O
additional O
considerations O
which O
, O
though O
not O
so O
strictly O
according O
with O
the O
wildness O
of O
his O
ruling O
passion O
, O
yet O
were O
by O
no O
means O
incapable O
of O
swaying O
him O
. O
To O
accomplish O
his O
object O
Ahab O
must O
use O
tools O
; O
and O
of O
all O
tools O
used O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
the O
moon O
, O
men O
are O
most O
apt O
to O
get O
out O
of O
order O
. O
He O
knew O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
however O
magnetic O
his O
ascendency O
in O
some O
respects O
was O
over O
Starbuck O
, O
yet O
that O
ascendency O
did O
not O
cover O
the O
complete O
spiritual O
man O
any O
more O
than O
mere O
corporeal O
superiority O
involves O
intellectual O
mastership O
; O
for O
to O
the O
purely O
spiritual O
, O
the O
intellectual O
but O
stand O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
corporeal O
relation O
. O
Starbuck O
's O
body O
and O
Starbuck O
's O
coerced O
will O
were O
Ahab O
's O
, O
so O
long O
as O
Ahab O
kept O
his O
magnet O
at O
Starbuck O
's O
brain O
; O
still O
he O
knew O
that O
for O
all O
this O
the O
chief O
mate O
, O
in O
his O
soul O
, O
abhorred O
his O
captain O
's O
quest O
, O
and O
could O
he O
, O
would O
joyfully O
disintegrate O
himself O
from O
it O
, O
or O
even O
frustrate O
it O
. O
It O
might O
be O
that O
a O
long O
interval O
would O
elapse O
ere O
the O
White O
Whale O
was O
seen O
. O
During O
that O
long O
interval O
Starbuck O
would O
ever O
be O
apt O
to O
fall O
into O
open O
relapses O
of O
rebellion O
against O
his O
captain O
's O
leadership O
, O
unless O
some O
ordinary O
, O
prudential O
, O
circumstantial O
influences O
were O
brought O
to O
bear O
upon O
him O
. O
Not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
the O
subtle O
insanity O
of O
Ahab O
respecting O
Moby O
Dick O
was O
noways O
more O
significantly O
manifested O
than O
in O
his O
superlative O
sense O
and O
shrewdness O
in O
foreseeing O
that O
, O
for O
the O
present O
, O
the O
hunt O
should O
in O
some O
way O
be O
stripped O
of O
that O
strange O
imaginative O
impiousness O
which O
naturally O
invested O
it O
; O
that O
the O
full O
terror O
of O
the O
voyage O
must O
be O
kept O
withdrawn O
into O
the O
obscure O
background O
( O
for O
few O
men O
's O
courage O
is O
proof O
against O
protracted O
meditation O
unrelieved O
by O
action O
) O
; O
that O
when O
they O
stood O
their O
long O
night O
watches O
, O
his O
officers O
and O
men O
must O
have O
some O
nearer O
things O
to O
think O
of O
than O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
For O
however O
eagerly O
and O
impetuously O
the O
savage O
crew O
had O
hailed O
the O
announcement O
of O
his O
quest O
; O
yet O
all O
sailors O
of O
all O
sorts O
are O
more O
or O
less O
capricious O
and O
unreliable— O
they O
live O
in O
the O
varying O
outer O
weather O
, O
and O
they O
inhale O
its O
fickleness— O
and O
when O
retained O
for O
any O
object O
remote O
and O
blank O
in O
the O
pursuit O
, O
however O
promissory O
of O
life O
and O
passion O
in O
the O
end O
, O
it O
is O
above O
all O
things O
requisite O
that O
temporary O
interests O
and O
employments O
should O
intervene O
and O
hold O
them O
healthily O
suspended O
for O
the O
final O
dash O
. O
Nor O
was O
Ahab O
unmindful O
of O
another O
thing O
. O
In O
times O
of O
strong O
emotion O
mankind O
disdain O
all O
base O
considerations O
; O
but O
such O
times O
are O
evanescent O
. O
The O
permanent O
constitutional O
condition O
of O
the O
manufactured O
man O
, O
thought O
Ahab O
, O
is O
sordidness O
. O
Granting O
that O
the O
White O
Whale O
fully O
incites O
the O
hearts O
of O
this O
my O
savage O
crew O
, O
and O
playing O
round O
their O
savageness O
even O
breeds O
a O
certain O
generous O
knight-errantism O
in O
them O
, O
still O
, O
while O
for O
the O
love O
of O
it O
they O
give O
chase O
to O
Moby O
Dick O
, O
they O
must O
also O
have O
food O
for O
their O
more O
common O
, O
daily O
appetites O
. O
For O
even O
the O
high O
lifted O
and O
chivalric O
Crusaders O
of O
old O
times O
were O
not O
content O
to O
traverse O
two O
thousand O
miles O
of O
land O
to O
fight O
for O
their O
holy O
sepulchre O
, O
without O
committing O
burglaries O
, O
picking O
pockets O
, O
and O
gaining O
other O
pious O
perquisites O
by O
the O
way O
. O
Had O
they O
been O
strictly O
held O
to O
their O
one O
final O
and O
romantic O
object— O
that O
final O
and O
romantic O
object O
, O
too O
many O
would O
have O
turned O
from O
in O
disgust O
. O
I O
will O
not O
strip O
these O
men O
, O
thought O
Ahab O
, O
of O
all O
hopes O
of O
cash—aye O
, O
cash O
. O
They O
may O
scorn O
cash O
now O
; O
but O
let O
some O
months O
go O
by O
, O
and O
no O
perspective O
promise O
of O
it O
to O
them O
, O
and O
then O
this O
same O
quiescent O
cash O
all O
at O
once O
mutinying O
in O
them O
, O
this O
same O
cash O
would O
soon O
cashier O
Ahab O
. O
Nor O
was O
there O
wanting O
still O
another O
precautionary O
motive O
more O
related O
to O
Ahab O
personally O
. O
Having O
impulsively O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
, O
and O
perhaps O
somewhat O
prematurely O
revealed O
the O
prime O
but O
private O
purpose O
of O
the O
Pequod O
's O
voyage O
, O
Ahab O
was O
now O
entirely O
conscious O
that O
, O
in O
so O
doing O
, O
he O
had O
indirectly O
laid O
himself O
open O
to O
the O
unanswerable O
charge O
of O
usurpation O
; O
and O
with O
perfect O
impunity O
, O
both O
moral O
and O
legal O
, O
his O
crew O
if O
so O
disposed O
, O
and O
to O
that O
end O
competent O
, O
could O
refuse O
all O
further O
obedience O
to O
him O
, O
and O
even O
violently O
wrest O
from O
him O
the O
command O
. O
From O
even O
the O
barely O
hinted O
imputation O
of O
usurpation O
, O
and O
the O
possible O
consequences O
of O
such O
a O
suppressed O
impression O
gaining O
ground O
, O
Ahab O
must O
of O
course O
have O
been O
most O
anxious O
to O
protect O
himself O
. O
That O
protection O
could O
only O
consist O
in O
his O
own O
predominating O
brain O
and O
heart O
and O
hand O
, O
backed O
by O
a O
heedful O
, O
closely O
calculating O
attention O
to O
every O
minute O
atmospheric O
influence O
which O
it O
was O
possible O
for O
his O
crew O
to O
be O
subjected O
to O
. O
For O
all O
these O
reasons O
then O
, O
and O
others O
perhaps O
too O
analytic O
to O
be O
verbally O
developed O
here O
, O
Ahab O
plainly O
saw O
that O
he O
must O
still O
in O
a O
good O
degree O
continue O
true O
to O
the O
natural O
, O
nominal O
purpose O
of O
the O
Pequod O
's O
voyage O
; O
observe O
all O
customary O
usages O
; O
and O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
force O
himself O
to O
evince O
all O
his O
well O
known O
passionate O
interest O
in O
the O
general O
pursuit O
of O
his O
profession O
. O
Be O
all O
this O
as O
it O
may O
, O
his O
voice O
was O
now O
often O
heard O
hailing O
the O
three O
mastheads O
and O
admonishing O
them O
to O
keep O
a O
bright O
look-out O
, O
and O
not O
omit O
reporting O
even O
a O
porpoise O
. O
This O
vigilance O
was O
not O
long O
without O
reward O
. O
