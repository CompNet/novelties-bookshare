So O
far O
as O
what O
there O
may O
be O
of O
a O
narrative O
in O
this O
book O
; O
and O
, O
indeed O
, O
as O
indirectly O
touching O
one O
or O
two O
very O
interesting O
and O
curious O
particulars O
in O
the O
habits O
of O
sperm O
whales O
, O
the O
foregoing O
chapter O
, O
in O
its O
earlier O
part O
, O
is O
as O
important O
a O
one O
as O
will O
be O
found O
in O
this O
volume O
; O
but O
the O
leading O
matter O
of O
it O
requires O
to O
be O
still O
further O
and O
more O
familiarly O
enlarged O
upon O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
adequately O
understood O
, O
and O
moreover O
to O
take O
away O
any O
incredulity O
which O
a O
profound O
ignorance O
of O
the O
entire O
subject O
may O
induce O
in O
some O
minds O
, O
as O
to O
the O
natural O
verity O
of O
the O
main O
points O
of O
this O
affair O
. O
I O
care O
not O
to O
perform O
this O
part O
of O
my O
task O
methodically O
; O
but O
shall O
be O
content O
to O
produce O
the O
desired O
impression O
by O
separate O
citations O
of O
items O
, O
practically O
or O
reliably O
known O
to O
me O
as O
a O
whaleman O
; O
and O
from O
these O
citations O
, O
I O
take O
it— O
the O
conclusion O
aimed O
at O
will O
naturally O
follow O
of O
itself O
. O
First O
: O
I O
have O
personally O
known O
three O
instances O
where O
a O
whale O
, O
after O
receiving O
a O
harpoon O
, O
has O
effected O
a O
complete O
escape O
; O
and O
, O
after O
an O
interval O
( O
in O
one O
instance O
of O
three O
years O
) O
, O
has O
been O
again O
struck O
by O
the O
same O
hand O
, O
and O
slain O
; O
when O
the O
two O
irons O
, O
both O
marked O
by O
the O
same O
private O
cypher O
, O
have O
been O
taken O
from O
the O
body O
. O
In O
the O
instance O
where O
three O
years O
intervened O
between O
the O
flinging O
of O
the O
two O
harpoons O
; O
and O
I O
think O
it O
may O
have O
been O
something O
more O
than O
that O
; O
the O
man O
who O
darted O
them O
happening O
, O
in O
the O
interval O
, O
to O
go O
in O
a O
trading O
ship O
on O
a O
voyage O
to O
Africa O
, O
went O
ashore O
there O
, O
joined O
a O
discovery O
party O
, O
and O
penetrated O
far O
into O
the O
interior O
, O
where O
he O
travelled O
for O
a O
period O
of O
nearly O
two O
years O
, O
often O
endangered O
by O
serpents O
, O
savages O
, O
tigers O
, O
poisonous O
miasmas O
, O
with O
all O
the O
other O
common O
perils O
incident O
to O
wandering O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
unknown O
regions O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
whale O
he O
had O
struck O
must O
also O
have O
been O
on O
its O
travels O
; O
no O
doubt O
it O
had O
thrice O
circumnavigated O
the O
globe O
, O
brushing O
with O
its O
flanks O
all O
the O
coasts O
of O
Africa O
; O
but O
to O
no O
purpose O
. O
This O
man O
and O
this O
whale O
again O
came O
together O
, O
and O
the O
one O
vanquished O
the O
other O
. O
I O
say O
I O
, O
myself O
, O
have O
known O
three O
instances O
similar O
to O
this O
; O
that O
is O
in O
two O
of O
them O
I O
saw O
the O
whales O
struck O
; O
and O
, O
upon O
the O
second O
attack O
, O
saw O
the O
two O
irons O
with O
the O
respective O
marks O
cut O
in O
them O
, O
afterwards O
taken O
from O
the O
dead O
fish O
. O
In O
the O
three-year O
instance O
, O
it O
so O
fell O
out O
that O
I O
was O
in O
the O
boat O
both O
times O
, O
first O
and O
last O
, O
and O
the O
last O
time O
distinctly O
recognized O
a O
peculiar O
sort O
of O
huge O
mole O
under O
the O
whale O
's O
eye O
, O
which O
I O
had O
observed O
there O
three O
years O
previous O
. O
I O
say O
three O
years O
, O
but O
I O
am O
pretty O
sure O
it O
was O
more O
than O
that O
. O
Here O
are O
three O
instances O
, O
then O
, O
which O
I O
personally O
know O
the O
truth O
of O
; O
but O
I O
have O
heard O
of O
many O
other O
instances O
from O
persons O
whose O
veracity O
in O
the O
matter O
there O
is O
no O
good O
ground O
to O
impeach O
. O
Secondly O
: O
It O
is O
well O
known O
in O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
Fishery O
, O
however O
ignorant O
the O
world O
ashore O
may O
be O
of O
it O
, O
that O
there O
have O
been O
several O
memorable O
historical O
instances O
where O
a O
particular O
whale O
in O
the O
ocean O
has O
been O
at O
distant O
times O
and O
places O
popularly O
cognisable O
. O
Why O
such O
a O
whale O
became O
thus O
marked O
was O
not O
altogether O
and O
originally O
owing O
to O
his O
bodily O
peculiarities O
as O
distinguished O
from O
other O
whales O
; O
for O
however O
peculiar O
in O
that O
respect O
any O
chance O
whale O
may O
be O
, O
they O
soon O
put O
an O
end O
to O
his O
peculiarities O
by O
killing O
him O
, O
and O
boiling O
him O
down O
into O
a O
peculiarly O
valuable O
oil O
. O
No O
: O
the O
reason O
was O
this O
: O
that O
from O
the O
fatal O
experiences O
of O
the O
fishery O
there O
hung O
a O
terrible O
prestige O
of O
perilousness O
about O
such O
a O
whale O
as O
there O
did O
about O
Rinaldo O
Rinaldini O
, O
insomuch O
that O
most O
fishermen O
were O
content O
to O
recognise O
him O
by O
merely O
touching O
their O
tarpaulins O
when O
he O
would O
be O
discovered O
lounging O
by O
them O
on O
the O
sea O
, O
without O
seeking O
to O
cultivate O
a O
more O
intimate O
acquaintance O
. O
Like O
some O
poor O
devils O
ashore O
that O
happen O
to O
known O
an O
irascible O
great O
man O
, O
they O
make O
distant O
unobtrusive O
salutations O
to O
him O
in O
the O
street O
, O
lest O
if O
they O
pursued O
the O
acquaintance O
further O
, O
they O
might O
receive O
a O
summary O
thump O
for O
their O
presumption O
. O
But O
not O
only O
did O
each O
of O
these O
famous O
whales O
enjoy O
great O
individual O
celebrity—nay O
, O
you O
may O
call O
it O
an O
oceanwide O
renown O
; O
not O
only O
was O
he O
famous O
in O
life O
and O
now O
is O
immortal O
in O
forecastle O
stories O
after O
death O
, O
but O
he O
was O
admitted O
into O
all O
the O
rights O
, O
privileges O
, O
and O
distinctions O
of O
a O
name O
; O
had O
as O
much O
a O
name O
indeed O
as O
Cambyses O
or O
Caesar O
. O
Was O
it O
not O
so O
, O
O O
Timor O
Tom O
! O
thou O
famed O
leviathan O
, O
scarred O
like O
an O
iceberg O
, O
who O
so O
long O
did'st O
lurk O
in O
the O
Oriental O
straits O
of O
that O
name O
, O
whose O
spout O
was O
oft O
seen O
from O
the O
palmy O
beach O
of O
Ombay O
? O
Was O
it O
not O
so O
, O
O O
New O
Zealand O
Jack O
! O
thou O
terror O
of O
all O
cruisers O
that O
crossed O
their O
wakes O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
the O
Tattoo O
Land O
? O
Was O
it O
not O
so O
, O
O O
Morquan O
! O
King O
of O
Japan O
, O
whose O
lofty O
jet O
they O
say O
at O
times O
assumed O
the O
semblance O
of O
a O
snow-white O
cross O
against O
the O
sky O
? O
Was O
it O
not O
so O
, O
O O
Don O
Miguel O
! O
thou O
Chilian O
whale O
, O
marked O
like O
an O
old O
tortoise O
with O
mystic O
hieroglyphics O
upon O
the O
back O
! O
In O
plain O
prose O
, O
here O
are O
four O
whales O
as O
well O
known O
to O
the O
students O
of O
Cetacean O
History O
as O
Marius O
or O
Sylla O
to O
the O
classic O
scholar O
. O
But O
this O
is O
not O
all O
. O
New O
Zealand O
Tom O
and O
Don O
Miguel O
, O
after O
at O
various O
times O
creating O
great O
havoc O
among O
the O
boats O
of O
different O
vessels O
, O
were O
finally O
gone O
in O
quest O
of O
, O
systematically O
hunted O
out O
, O
chased O
and O
killed O
by O
valiant O
whaling O
captains O
, O
who O
heaved O
up O
their O
anchors O
with O
that O
express O
object O
as O
much O
in O
view O
, O
as O
in O
setting O
out O
through O
the O
Narragansett O
Woods O
, O
Captain O
Butler O
of O
old O
had O
it O
in O
his O
mind O
to O
capture O
that O
notorious O
murderous O
savage O
Annawon O
, O
the O
headmost O
warrior O
of O
the O
Indian O
King O
Philip O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
where O
I O
can O
find O
a O
better O
place O
than O
just O
here O
, O
to O
make O
mention O
of O
one O
or O
two O
other O
things O
, O
which O
to O
me O
seem O
important O
, O
as O
in O
printed O
form O
establishing O
in O
all O
respects O
the O
reasonableness O
of O
the O
whole O
story O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
, O
more O
especially O
the O
catastrophe O
. O
For O
this O
is O
one O
of O
those O
disheartening O
instances O
where O
truth O
requires O
full O
as O
much O
bolstering O
as O
error O
. O
So O
ignorant O
are O
most O
landsmen O
of O
some O
of O
the O
plainest O
and O
most O
palpable O
wonders O
of O
the O
world O
, O
that O
without O
some O
hints O
touching O
the O
plain O
facts O
, O
historical O
and O
otherwise O
, O
of O
the O
fishery O
, O
they O
might O
scout O
at O
Moby O
Dick O
as O
a O
monstrous O
fable O
, O
or O
still O
worse O
and O
more O
detestable O
, O
a O
hideous O
and O
intolerable O
allegory O
. O
First O
: O
Though O
most O
men O
have O
some O
vague O
flitting O
ideas O
of O
the O
general O
perils O
of O
the O
grand O
fishery O
, O
yet O
they O
have O
nothing O
like O
a O
fixed O
, O
vivid O
conception O
of O
those O
perils O
, O
and O
the O
frequency O
with O
which O
they O
recur O
. O
One O
reason O
perhaps O
is O
, O
that O
not O
one O
in O
fifty O
of O
the O
actual O
disasters O
and O
deaths O
by O
casualties O
in O
the O
fishery O
, O
ever O
finds O
a O
public O
record O
at O
home O
, O
however O
transient O
and O
immediately O
forgotten O
that O
record O
. O
Do O
you O
suppose O
that O
that O
poor O
fellow O
there O
, O
who O
this O
moment O
perhaps O
caught O
by O
the O
whale-line O
off O
the O
coast O
of O
New O
Guinea O
, O
is O
being O
carried O
down O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
by O
the O
sounding O
leviathan— O
do O
you O
suppose O
that O
that O
poor O
fellow O
's O
name O
will O
appear O
in O
the O
newspaper O
obituary O
you O
will O
read O
to-morrow O
at O
your O
breakfast O
? O
No O
: O
because O
the O
mails O
are O
very O
irregular O
between O
here O
and O
New O
Guinea O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
did O
you O
ever O
hear O
what O
might O
be O
called O
regular O
news O
direct O
or O
indirect O
from O
New O
Guinea O
? O
Yet O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
that O
upon O
one O
particular O
voyage O
which O
I O
made O
to O
the O
Pacific O
, O
among O
many O
others O
we O
spoke O
thirty O
different O
ships O
, O
every O
one O
of O
which O
had O
had O
a O
death O
by O
a O
whale O
, O
some O
of O
them O
more O
than O
one O
, O
and O
three O
that O
had O
each O
lost O
a O
boat O
's O
crew O
. O
For O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
be O
economical O
with O
your O
lamps O
and O
candles O
! O
not O
a O
gallon O
you O
burn O
, O
but O
at O
least O
one O
drop O
of O
man O
's O
blood O
was O
spilled O
for O
it O
. O
Secondly O
: O
People O
ashore O
have O
indeed O
some O
indefinite O
idea O
that O
a O
whale O
is O
an O
enormous O
creature O
of O
enormous O
power O
; O
but O
I O
have O
ever O
found O
that O
when O
narrating O
to O
them O
some O
specific O
example O
of O
this O
two-fold O
enormousness O
, O
they O
have O
significantly O
complimented O
me O
upon O
my O
facetiousness O
; O
when O
, O
I O
declare O
upon O
my O
soul O
, O
I O
had O
no O
more O
idea O
of O
being O
facetious O
than O
Moses O
, O
when O
he O
wrote O
the O
history O
of O
the O
plagues O
of O
Egypt O
. O
But O
fortunately O
the O
special O
point O
I O
here O
seek O
can O
be O
established O
upon O
testimony O
entirely O
independent O
of O
my O
own O
. O
That O
point O
is O
this O
: O
The O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
in O
some O
cases O
sufficiently O
powerful O
, O
knowing O
, O
and O
judiciously O
malicious O
, O
as O
with O
direct O
aforethought O
to O
stave O
in O
, O
utterly O
destroy O
, O
and O
sink O
a O
large O
ship O
; O
and O
what O
is O
more O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
has O
done O
it O
. O
First O
: O
In O
the O
year O
1820 O
the O
ship O
Essex O
, O
Captain O
Pollard O
, O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
was O
cruising O
in O
the O
Pacific O
Ocean O
. O
One O
day O
she O
saw O
spouts O
, O
lowered O
her O
boats O
, O
and O
gave O
chase O
to O
a O
shoal O
of O
sperm O
whales O
. O
Ere O
long O
, O
several O
of O
the O
whales O
were O
wounded O
; O
when O
, O
suddenly O
, O
a O
very O
large O
whale O
escaping O
from O
the O
boats O
, O
issued O
from O
the O
shoal O
, O
and O
bore O
directly O
down O
upon O
the O
ship O
. O
Dashing O
his O
forehead O
against O
her O
hull O
, O
he O
so O
stove O
her O
in O
, O
that O
in O
less O
than O
" O
ten O
minutes O
" O
she O
settled O
down O
and O
fell O
over O
. O
Not O
a O
surviving O
plank O
of O
her O
has O
been O
seen O
since O
. O
After O
the O
severest O
exposure O
, O
part O
of O
the O
crew O
reached O
the O
land O
in O
their O
boats O
. O
Being O
returned O
home O
at O
last O
, O
Captain O
Pollard O
once O
more O
sailed O
for O
the O
Pacific O
in O
command O
of O
another O
ship O
, O
but O
the O
gods O
shipwrecked O
him O
again O
upon O
unknown O
rocks O
and O
breakers O
; O
for O
the O
second O
time O
his O
ship O
was O
utterly O
lost O
, O
and O
forthwith O
forswearing O
the O
sea O
, O
he O
has O
never O
attempted O
it O
since O
. O
At O
this O
day O
Captain O
Pollard O
is O
a O
resident O
of O
Nantucket O
. O
I O
have O
seen O
Owen O
Chace O
, O
who O
was O
chief O
mate O
of O
the O
Essex O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
tragedy O
; O
I O
have O
read O
his O
plain O
and O
faithful O
narrative O
; O
I O
have O
conversed O
with O
his O
son O
; O
and O
all O
this O
within O
a O
few O
miles O
of O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
catastrophe O
. O
* O
* O
The O
following O
are O
extracts O
from O
Chace O
's O
narrative O
: O
" O
Every O
fact O
seemed O
to O
warrant O
me O
in O
concluding O
that O
it O
was O
anything O
but O
chance O
which O
directed O
his O
operations O
; O
he O
made O
two O
several O
attacks O
upon O
the O
ship O
, O
at O
a O
short O
interval O
between O
them O
, O
both O
of O
this O
catastrophe O
I O
have O
never O
chanced O
to O
their O
direction O
, O
were O
calculated O
to O
do O
us O
the O
whale O
hunters O
I O
have O
now O
and O
then O
heard O
casual O
allusions O
to O
it O
. O
Thirdly O
: O
Some O
eighteen O
or O
twenty O
years O
ago O
Commodore O
J—-then O
commanding O
an O
American O
sloop-of-war O
of O
the O
first O
class O
, O
happened O
to O
be O
dining O
with O
a O
party O
of O
whaling O
captains O
, O
on O
board O
a O
Nantucket O
ship O
in O
the O
harbor O
of O
Oahu O
, O
Sandwich O
Islands O
. O
Conversation O
turning O
upon O
whales O
, O
the O
Commodore O
was O
pleased O
to O
be O
sceptical O
touching O
the O
amazing O
strength O
ascribed O
to O
them O
by O
the O
professional O
gentlemen O
present O
. O
He O
peremptorily O
denied O
for O
example O
, O
that O
any O
whale O
could O
so O
smite O
his O
stout O
sloop-of-war O
as O
to O
cause O
her O
to O
leak O
so O
much O
as O
a O
thimbleful O
. O
Very O
good O
; O
but O
there O
is O
more O
coming O
. O
Some O
weeks O
later O
, O
the O
Commodore O
set O
sail O
in O
this O
impregnable O
craft O
for O
Valparaiso O
. O
But O
he O
was O
stopped O
on O
the O
way O
by O
a O
portly O
sperm O
whale O
, O
that O
begged O
a O
few O
moments O
' O
confidential O
business O
with O
him O
. O
That O
business O
consisted O
in O
fetching O
the O
Commodore O
's O
craft O
such O
a O
thwack O
, O
that O
with O
all O
his O
pumps O
going O
he O
made O
straight O
for O
the O
nearest O
port O
to O
heave O
down O
and O
repair O
. O
I O
am O
not O
superstitious O
, O
but O
I O
consider O
the O
Commodore O
's O
interview O
with O
that O
whale O
as O
providential O
. O
Was O
not O
Saul O
of O
Tarsus O
converted O
from O
unbelief O
by O
a O
similar O
fright O
? O
I O
tell O
you O
, O
the O
sperm O
whale O
will O
stand O
no O
nonsense O
. O
I O
will O
now O
refer O
you O
to O
Langsdorff O
's O
Voyages O
for O
a O
little O
circumstance O
in O
point O
, O
peculiarly O
interesting O
to O
the O
writer O
hereof O
. O
Langsdorff O
, O
you O
must O
know O
by O
the O
way O
, O
was O
attached O
to O
the O
Russian O
Admiral O
Krusenstern O
's O
famous O
Discovery O
Expedition O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
present O
century O
. O
Captain O
Langsdorff O
thus O
begins O
his O
seventeenth O
chapter O
: O
" O
By O
the O
thirteenth O
of O
May O
our O
ship O
was O
ready O
to O
sail O
, O
and O
the O
next O
day O
we O
were O
out O
in O
the O
open O
sea O
, O
on O
our O
way O
to O
Ochotsh O
. O
The O
weather O
was O
very O
clear O
and O
fine O
, O
but O
so O
intolerably O
cold O
that O
we O
were O
obliged O
to O
keep O
on O
our O
fur O
clothing O
. O
For O
some O
days O
we O
had O
very O
little O
wind O
; O
it O
was O
not O
till O
the O
nineteenth O
that O
a O
brisk O
gale O
from O
the O
northwest O
sprang O
up O
. O
An O
uncommonly O
large O
whale O
, O
the O
body O
of O
which O
was O
larger O
than O
the O
ship O
itself O
, O
lay O
almost O
at O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
water O
, O
but O
was O
not O
perceived O
by O
any O
one O
on O
board O
till O
the O
moment O
when O
the O
ship O
, O
which O
was O
in O
full O
sail O
, O
was O
almost O
upon O
him O
, O
so O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
prevent O
its O
striking O
against O
him O
. O
We O
were O
thus O
placed O
in O
the O
most O
imminent O
danger O
, O
as O
this O
gigantic O
creature O
, O
setting O
up O
its O
back O
, O
raised O
the O
ship O
three O
feet O
at O
least O
out O
of O
the O
water O
. O
The O
masts O
reeled O
, O
and O
the O
sails O
fell O
altogether O
, O
while O
we O
who O
were O
below O
all O
sprang O
instantly O
upon O
the O
deck O
, O
concluding O
that O
we O
had O
struck O
upon O
some O
rock O
; O
instead O
of O
this O
we O
saw O
the O
monster O
sailing O
off O
with O
the O
utmost O
gravity O
and O
solemnity O
. O
Captain O
D'Wolf O
applied O
immediately O
to O
the O
pumps O
to O
examine O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
vessel O
had O
received O
any O
damage O
from O
the O
shock O
, O
but O
we O
found O
that O
very O
happily O
it O
had O
escaped O
entirely O
uninjured O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
the O
Captain O
D'Wolf O
here O
alluded O
to O
as O
commanding O
the O
ship O
in O
question O
, O
is O
a O
New O
Englander O
, O
who O
, O
after O
a O
long O
life O
of O
unusual O
adventures O
as O
a O
sea-captain O
, O
this O
day O
resides O
in O
the O
village O
of O
Dorchester O
near O
Boston O
. O
I O
have O
the O
honor O
of O
being O
a O
nephew O
of O
his O
. O
I O
have O
particularly O
questioned O
him O
concerning O
this O
passage O
in O
Langsdorff O
. O
He O
substantiates O
every O
word O
. O
The O
ship O
, O
however O
, O
was O
by O
no O
means O
a O
large O
one O
: O
a O
Russian O
craft O
built O
on O
the O
Siberian O
coast O
, O
and O
purchased O
by O
my O
uncle O
after O
bartering O
away O
the O
vessel O
in O
which O
he O
sailed O
from O
home O
. O
In O
that O
up O
and O
down O
manly O
book O
of O
old-fashioned O
adventure O
, O
so O
full O
, O
too O
, O
of O
honest O
wonders—the O
voyage O
of O
Lionel O
Wafer O
, O
one O
of O
ancient O
Dampier O
's O
old O
chums—I O
found O
a O
little O
matter O
set O
down O
so O
like O
that O
just O
quoted O
from O
Langsdorff O
, O
that O
I O
can O
not O
forbear O
inserting O
it O
here O
for O
a O
corroborative O
example O
, O
if O
such O
be O
needed O
. O
Lionel O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
" O
John O
Ferdinando O
, O
" O
as O
he O
calls O
the O
modern O
Juan O
Fernandes O
. O
" O
In O
our O
way O
thither O
, O
" O
he O
says O
, O
" O
about O
four O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
when O
we O
were O
about O
one O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
leagues O
from O
the O
Main O
of O
America O
, O
our O
ship O
felt O
a O
terrible O
shock O
, O
which O
put O
our O
men O
in O
such O
consternation O
that O
they O
could O
hardly O
tell O
where O
they O
were O
or O
what O
to O
think O
; O
but O
every O
one O
began O
to O
prepare O
for O
death O
. O
And O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
shock O
was O
so O
sudden O
and O
violent O
, O
that O
we O
took O
it O
for O
granted O
the O
ship O
had O
struck O
against O
a O
rock O
; O
but O
when O
the O
amazement O
was O
a O
little O
over O
, O
we O
cast O
the O
lead O
, O
and O
sounded O
, O
but O
found O
no O
ground O
. O
… O
The O
suddenness O
of O
the O
shock O
made O
the O
guns O
leap O
in O
their O
carriages O
, O
and O
several O
of O
the O
men O
were O
shaken O
out O
of O
their O
hammocks O
. O
Captain O
Davis O
, O
who O
lay O
with O
his O
head O
on O
a O
gun O
, O
was O
thrown O
out O
of O
his O
cabin O
! O
" O
Lionel O
then O
goes O
on O
to O
impute O
the O
shock O
to O
an O
earthquake O
, O
and O
seems O
to O
substantiate O
the O
imputation O
by O
stating O
that O
a O
great O
earthquake O
, O
somewhere O
about O
that O
time O
, O
did O
actually O
do O
great O
mischief O
along O
the O
Spanish O
land O
. O
But O
I O
should O
not O
much O
wonder O
if O
, O
in O
the O
darkness O
of O
that O
early O
hour O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
the O
shock O
was O
after O
all O
caused O
by O
an O
unseen O
whale O
vertically O
bumping O
the O
hull O
from O
beneath O
. O
I O
might O
proceed O
with O
several O
more O
examples O
, O
one O
way O
or O
another O
known O
to O
me O
, O
of O
the O
great O
power O
and O
malice O
at O
times O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
. O
In O
more O
than O
one O
instance O
, O
he O
has O
been O
known O
, O
not O
only O
to O
chase O
the O
assailing O
boats O
back O
to O
their O
ships O
, O
but O
to O
pursue O
the O
ship O
itself O
, O
and O
long O
withstand O
all O
the O
lances O
hurled O
at O
him O
from O
its O
decks O
. O
The O
English O
ship O
Pusie O
Hall O
can O
tell O
a O
story O
on O
that O
head O
; O
and O
, O
as O
for O
his O
strength O
, O
let O
me O
say O
, O
that O
there O
have O
been O
examples O
where O
the O
lines O
attached O
to O
a O
running O
sperm O
whale O
have O
, O
in O
a O
calm O
, O
been O
transferred O
to O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
secured O
there O
! O
the O
whale O
towing O
her O
great O
hull O
through O
the O
water O
, O
as O
a O
horse O
walks O
off O
with O
a O
cart O
. O
Again O
, O
it O
is O
very O
often O
observed O
that O
, O
if O
the O
sperm O
whale O
, O
once O
struck O
, O
is O
allowed O
time O
to O
rally O
, O
he O
then O
acts O
, O
not O
so O
often O
with O
blind O
rage O
, O
as O
with O
wilful O
, O
deliberate O
designs O
of O
destruction O
to O
his O
pursuers O
; O
nor O
is O
it O
without O
conveying O
some O
eloquent O
indication O
of O
his O
character O
, O
that O
upon O
being O
attacked O
he O
will O
frequently O
open O
his O
mouth O
, O
and O
retain O
it O
in O
that O
dread O
expansion O
for O
several O
consecutive O
minutes O
. O
But O
I O
must O
be O
content O
with O
only O
one O
more O
and O
a O
concluding O
illustration O
; O
a O
remarkable O
and O
most O
significant O
one O
, O
by O
which O
you O
will O
not O
fail O
to O
see O
, O
that O
not O
only O
is O
the O
most O
marvellous O
event O
in O
this O
book O
corroborated O
by O
plain O
facts O
of O
the O
present O
day O
, O
but O
that O
these O
marvels O
( O
like O
all O
marvels O
) O
are O
mere O
repetitions O
of O
the O
ages O
; O
so O
that O
for O
the O
millionth O
time O
we O
say O
amen O
with O
Solomon—Verily O
there O
is O
nothing O
new O
under O
the O
sun O
. O
In O
the O
sixth O
Christian O
century O
lived O
Procopius O
, O
a O
Christian O
magistrate O
of O
Constantinople O
, O
in O
the O
days O
when O
Justinian O
was O
Emperor O
and O
Belisarius O
general O
. O
As O
many O
know O
, O
he O
wrote O
the O
history O
of O
his O
own O
times O
, O
a O
work O
every O
way O
of O
uncommon O
value O
. O
By O
the O
best O
authorities O
, O
he O
has O
always O
been O
considered O
a O
most O
trustworthy O
and O
unexaggerating O
historian O
, O
except O
in O
some O
one O
or O
two O
particulars O
, O
not O
at O
all O
affecting O
the O
matter O
presently O
to O
be O
mentioned O
. O
Now O
, O
in O
this O
history O
of O
his O
, O
Procopius O
mentions O
that O
, O
during O
the O
term O
of O
his O
prefecture O
at O
Constantinople O
, O
a O
great O
sea-monster O
was O
captured O
in O
the O
neighboring O
Propontis O
, O
or O
Sea O
of O
Marmora O
, O
after O
having O
destroyed O
vessels O
at O
intervals O
in O
those O
waters O
for O
a O
period O
of O
more O
than O
fifty O
years O
. O
A O
fact O
thus O
set O
down O
in O
substantial O
history O
can O
not O
easily O
be O
gainsaid O
. O
Nor O
is O
there O
any O
reason O
it O
should O
be O
. O
Of O
what O
precise O
species O
this O
sea-monster O
was O
, O
is O
not O
mentioned O
. O
But O
as O
he O
destroyed O
ships O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
other O
reasons O
, O
he O
must O
have O
been O
a O
whale O
; O
and O
I O
am O
strongly O
inclined O
to O
think O
a O
sperm O
whale O
. O
And O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
why O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
I O
fancied O
that O
the O
sperm O
whale O
had O
been O
always O
unknown O
in O
the O
Mediterranean O
and O
the O
deep O
waters O
connecting O
with O
it O
. O
Even O
now O
I O
am O
certain O
that O
those O
seas O
are O
not O
, O
and O
perhaps O
never O
can O
be O
, O
in O
the O
present O
constitution O
of O
things O
, O
a O
place O
for O
his O
habitual O
gregarious O
resort O
. O
But O
further O
investigations O
have O
recently O
proved O
to O
me O
, O
that O
in O
modern O
times O
there O
have O
been O
isolated O
instances O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
in O
the O
Mediterranean O
. O
I O
am O
told O
, O
on O
good O
authority O
, O
that O
on O
the O
Barbary O
coast O
, O
a O
Commodore O
Davis O
of O
the O
British O
navy O
found O
the O
skeleton O
of O
a O
sperm O
whale O
. O
Now O
, O
as O
a O
vessel O
of O
war O
readily O
passes O
through O
the O
Dardanelles O
, O
hence O
a O
sperm O
whale O
could O
, O
by O
the O
same O
route O
, O
pass O
out O
of O
the O
Mediterranean O
into O
the O
Propontis O
. O
In O
the O
Propontis O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
can O
learn O
, O
none O
of O
that O
peculiar O
substance O
called O
brit O
is O
to O
be O
found O
, O
the O
aliment O
of O
the O
right O
whale O
. O
But O
I O
have O
every O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O
food O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale— O
squid O
or O
cuttle-fish—lurks O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
sea O
, O
because O
large O
creatures O
, O
but O
by O
no O
means O
the O
largest O
of O
that O
sort O
, O
have O
been O
found O
at O
its O
surface O
. O
If O
, O
then O
, O
you O
properly O
put O
these O
statements O
together O
, O
and O
reason O
upon O
them O
a O
bit O
, O
you O
will O
clearly O
perceive O
that O
, O
according O
to O
all O
human O
reasoning O
, O
Procopius O
's O
sea-monster O
, O
that O
for O
half O
a O
century O
stove O
the O
ships O
of O
a O
Roman O
Emperor O
, O
must O
in O
all O
probability O
have O
been O
a O
sperm O
whale O
. O
