Ere O
the O
English O
ship O
fades O
from O
sight O
be O
it O
set O
down O
here O
, O
that O
she O
hailed O
from O
London O
, O
and O
was O
named O
after O
the O
late O
Samuel O
Enderby O
, O
merchant O
of O
that O
city O
, O
the O
original O
of O
the O
famous O
whaling O
house O
of O
enderby O
and O
sons O
; O
a O
house O
which O
in O
my O
poor O
whaleman O
's O
opinion O
, O
comes O
not O
far O
behind O
the O
united O
royal O
houses O
of O
the O
Tudors O
and O
Bourbons O
, O
in O
point O
of O
real O
historical O
interest O
. O
How O
long O
, O
prior O
to O
the O
year O
of O
our O
Lord O
1775 O
, O
this O
great O
whaling O
house O
was O
in O
existence O
, O
my O
numerous O
fish-documents O
do O
not O
make O
plain O
; O
but O
in O
that O
year O
( O
1775 O
) O
it O
fitted O
out O
the O
first O
English O
ships O
that O
ever O
regularly O
hunted O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
; O
though O
for O
some O
score O
of O
years O
previous O
( O
ever O
since O
1726 O
) O
our O
valiant O
Coffins O
and O
Maceys O
of O
Nantucket O
and O
the O
Vineyard O
had O
in O
large O
fleets O
pursued O
the O
Leviathan O
, O
but O
only O
in O
the O
North O
and O
South O
Atlantic O
: O
not O
elsewhere O
. O
Be O
it O
distinctly O
recorded O
here O
, O
that O
the O
Nantucketers O
were O
the O
first O
among O
mankind O
to O
harpoon O
with O
civilized O
steel O
the O
great O
Sperm O
Whale O
; O
and O
that O
for O
half O
a O
century O
they O
were O
the O
only O
people O
of O
the O
whole O
globe O
who O
so O
harpooned O
him O
. O
In O
1778 O
, O
a O
fine O
ship O
, O
the O
Amelia O
, O
fitted O
out O
for O
the O
express O
purpose O
, O
and O
at O
the O
sole O
charge O
of O
the O
vigorous O
Enderbys O
, O
boldly O
rounded O
Cape O
Horn O
, O
and O
was O
the O
first O
among O
the O
nations O
to O
lower O
a O
whale-boat O
of O
any O
sort O
in O
the O
great O
South O
Sea O
. O
The O
voyage O
was O
a O
skilful O
and O
lucky O
one O
; O
and O
returning O
to O
her O
berth O
with O
her O
hold O
full O
of O
the O
precious O
sperm O
, O
the O
Amelia O
's O
example O
was O
soon O
followed O
by O
other O
ships O
, O
English O
and O
American O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
vast O
Sperm O
Whale O
grounds O
of O
the O
Pacific O
were O
thrown O
open O
. O
But O
not O
content O
with O
this O
good O
deed O
, O
the O
indefatigable O
house O
again O
bestirred O
itself O
: O
Samuel O
and O
all O
his O
Sons—how O
many O
, O
their O
mother O
only O
knows—and O
under O
their O
immediate O
auspices O
, O
and O
partly O
, O
I O
think O
, O
at O
their O
expense O
, O
the O
British O
government O
was O
induced O
to O
send O
the O
sloop-of-war O
Rattler O
on O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
of O
discovery O
into O
the O
South O
Sea O
. O
Commanded O
by O
a O
naval O
Post-Captain O
, O
the O
Rattler O
made O
a O
rattling O
voyage O
of O
it O
, O
and O
did O
some O
service O
; O
how O
much O
does O
not O
appear O
. O
But O
this O
is O
not O
all O
. O
In O
1819 O
, O
the O
same O
house O
fitted O
out O
a O
discovery O
whale O
ship O
of O
their O
own O
, O
to O
go O
on O
a O
tasting O
cruise O
to O
the O
remote O
waters O
of O
Japan O
. O
That O
ship— O
well O
called O
the O
" O
Syren O
" O
—made O
a O
noble O
experimental O
cruise O
; O
and O
it O
was O
thus O
that O
the O
great O
Japanese O
Whaling O
Ground O
first O
became O
generally O
known O
. O
The O
Syren O
in O
this O
famous O
voyage O
was O
commanded O
by O
a O
Captain O
Coffin O
, O
a O
Nantucketer O
. O
All O
honor O
to O
the O
Enderbies O
, O
therefore O
, O
whose O
house O
, O
I O
think O
, O
exists O
to O
the O
present O
day O
; O
though O
doubtless O
the O
original O
Samuel O
must O
long O
ago O
have O
slipped O
his O
cable O
for O
the O
great O
South O
Sea O
of O
the O
other O
world O
. O
The O
ship O
named O
after O
him O
was O
worthy O
of O
the O
honor O
, O
being O
a O
very O
fast O
sailer O
and O
a O
noble O
craft O
every O
way O
. O
I O
boarded O
her O
once O
at O
midnight O
somewhere O
off O
the O
Patagonian O
coast O
, O
and O
drank O
good O
flip O
down O
in O
the O
forecastle O
. O
It O
was O
a O
fine O
gam O
we O
had O
, O
and O
they O
were O
all O
trumps—every O
soul O
on O
board O
. O
A O
short O
life O
to O
them O
, O
and O
a O
jolly O
death O
. O
And O
that O
fine O
gam O
I O
had— O
long O
, O
very O
long O
after O
old O
Ahab O
touched O
her O
planks O
with O
his O
ivory O
heel— O
it O
minds O
me O
of O
the O
noble O
, O
solid O
, O
Saxon O
hospitality O
of O
that O
ship O
; O
and O
may O
my O
parson O
forget O
me O
, O
and O
the O
devil O
remember O
me O
, O
if O
I O
ever O
lose O
sight O
of O
it O
. O
Flip O
? O
Did O
I O
say O
we O
had O
flip O
? O
Yes O
, O
and O
we O
flipped O
it O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
ten O
gallons O
the O
hour O
; O
and O
when O
the O
squall O
came O
( O
for O
it O
's O
squally O
off O
there O
by O
Patagonia O
) O
, O
and O
all O
hands— O
visitors O
and O
all—were O
called O
to O
reef O
topsails O
, O
we O
were O
so O
top-heavy O
that O
we O
had O
to O
swing O
each O
other O
aloft O
in O
bowlines O
; O
and O
we O
ignorantly O
furled O
the O
skirts O
of O
our O
jackets O
into O
the O
sails O
, O
so O
that O
we O
hung O
there O
, O
reefed O
fast O
in O
the O
howling O
gale O
, O
a O
warning O
example O
to O
all O
drunken O
tars O
. O
However O
, O
the O
masts O
did O
not O
go O
overboard O
; O
and O
by O
and O
by O
we O
scrambled O
down O
, O
so O
sober O
, O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pass O
the O
flip O
again O
, O
though O
the O
savage O
salt O
spray O
bursting O
down O
the O
forecastle O
scuttle O
, O
rather O
too O
much O
diluted O
and O
pickled O
it O
for O
my O
taste O
. O
The O
beef O
was O
fine—tough O
, O
but O
with O
body O
in O
it O
. O
They O
said O
it O
was O
bullbeef O
; O
others O
, O
that O
it O
was O
dromedary O
beef O
; O
but O
I O
do O
not O
know O
, O
for O
certain O
, O
how O
that O
was O
. O
They O
had O
dumplings O
too O
; O
small O
, O
but O
substantial O
, O
symmetrically O
globular O
, O
and O
indestructible O
dumplings O
. O
I O
fancied O
that O
you O
could O
feel O
them O
, O
and O
roll O
them O
about O
in O
you O
after O
they O
were O
swallowed O
. O
If O
you O
stooped O
over O
too O
far O
forward O
, O
you O
risked O
their O
pitching O
out O
of O
you O
like O
billiard-balls O
. O
The O
bread— O
but O
that O
could O
n't O
be O
helped O
; O
besides O
, O
it O
was O
an O
anti-scorbutic O
, O
in O
short O
, O
the O
bread O
contained O
the O
only O
fresh O
fare O
they O
had O
. O
But O
the O
forecastle O
was O
not O
very O
light O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
easy O
to O
step O
over O
into O
a O
dark O
corner O
when O
you O
ate O
it O
. O
But O
all O
in O
all O
, O
taking O
her O
from O
truck O
to O
helm O
, O
considering O
the O
dimensions O
of O
the O
cook O
's O
boilers O
, O
including O
his O
own O
live O
parchment O
boilers O
; O
fore O
and O
aft O
, O
I O
say O
, O
the O
Samuel O
Enderby O
was O
a O
jolly O
ship O
; O
of O
good O
fare O
and O
plenty O
; O
fine O
flip O
and O
strong O
; O
crack O
fellows O
all O
, O
and O
capital O
from O
boot O
heels O
to O
hat-band O
. O
But O
why O
was O
it O
, O
think O
ye O
, O
that O
the O
Samuel O
Enderby O
, O
and O
some O
other O
English O
whalers O
I O
know O
of—not O
all O
though—were O
such O
famous O
, O
hospitable O
ships O
; O
that O
passed O
round O
the O
beef O
, O
and O
the O
bread O
, O
and O
the O
can O
, O
and O
the O
joke O
; O
and O
were O
not O
soon O
weary O
of O
eating O
, O
and O
drinking O
, O
and O
laughing O
? O
I O
will O
tell O
you O
. O
The O
abounding O
good O
cheer O
of O
these O
English O
whalers O
is O
matter O
for O
historical O
research O
. O
Nor O
have O
I O
been O
at O
all O
sparing O
of O
historical O
whale O
research O
, O
when O
it O
has O
seemed O
needed O
. O
The O
English O
were O
preceded O
in O
the O
whale O
fishery O
by O
the O
Hollanders O
, O
Zealanders O
, O
and O
Danes O
; O
from O
whom O
they O
derived O
many O
terms O
still O
extant O
in O
the O
fishery O
; O
and O
what O
is O
yet O
more O
, O
their O
fat O
old O
fashions O
, O
touching O
plenty O
to O
eat O
and O
drink O
. O
For O
, O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
, O
the O
English O
merchant-ship O
scrimps O
her O
crew O
; O
but O
not O
so O
the O
English O
whaler O
. O
Hence O
, O
in O
the O
English O
, O
this O
thing O
of O
whaling O
good O
cheer O
is O
not O
normal O
and O
natural O
, O
but O
incidental O
and O
particular O
; O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
must O
have O
some O
special O
origin O
, O
which O
is O
here O
pointed O
out O
, O
and O
will O
be O
still O
further O
elucidated O
. O
During O
my O
researches O
in O
the O
Leviathanic O
histories O
, O
I O
stumbled O
upon O
an O
ancient O
Dutch O
volume O
, O
which O
, O
by O
the O
musty O
whaling O
smell O
of O
it O
, O
I O
knew O
must O
be O
about O
whalers O
. O
The O
title O
was O
, O
" O
Dan O
Coopman O
, O
" O
wherefore O
I O
concluded O
that O
this O
must O
be O
the O
invaluable O
memoirs O
of O
some O
Amsterdam O
cooper O
in O
the O
fishery O
, O
as O
every O
whale O
ship O
must O
carry O
its O
cooper O
. O
I O
was O
reinforced O
in O
this O
opinion O
by O
seeing O
that O
it O
was O
the O
production O
of O
one O
" O
Fitz O
Swackhammer O
. O
" O
But O
my O
friend O
Dr. O
Snodhead O
, O
a O
very O
learned O
man O
, O
professor O
of O
Low O
Dutch O
and O
High O
German O
in O
the O
college O
of O
Santa O
Claus O
and O
St. O
Potts O
, O
to O
whom O
I O
handed O
the O
work O
for O
translation O
, O
giving O
him O
a O
box O
of O
sperm O
candles O
for O
his O
trouble—this O
same O
Dr. O
Snodhead O
, O
so O
soon O
as O
he O
spied O
the O
book O
, O
assured O
me O
that O
" O
Dan O
Coopman O
" O
did O
not O
mean O
" O
The O
Cooper O
, O
" O
but O
" O
The O
Merchant O
. O
" O
In O
short O
, O
this O
ancient O
and O
learned O
Low O
Dutch O
book O
treated O
of O
the O
commerce O
of O
Holland O
; O
and O
, O
among O
other O
subjects O
, O
contained O
a O
very O
interesting O
account O
of O
its O
whale O
fishery O
. O
And O
in O
this O
chapter O
it O
was O
, O
headed O
, O
" O
Smeer O
, O
" O
or O
" O
Fat O
, O
" O
that O
I O
found O
a O
long O
detailed O
list O
of O
the O
outfits O
for O
the O
larders O
and O
cellars O
of O
180 O
sail O
of O
Dutch O
whalemen O
; O
from O
which O
list O
, O
as O
translated O
by O
Dr. O
Snodhead O
, O
I O
transcribe O
the O
following O
: O
0084400,000 O
lbs O
. O
of O
beef O
. O
60,000 O
lbs O
. O
Friesland O
pork O
. O
150,000 O
lbs O
. O
of O
stock O
fish O
. O
550,000 O
lbs O
. O
of O
biscuit O
. O
72,000 O
lbs O
. O
of O
soft O
bread O
. O
2,800 O
firkins O
of O
butter O
. O
20,000 O
lbs O
. O
of O
Texel O
and O
Leyden O
cheese O
. O
144,000 O
lbs O
. O
cheese O
( O
probably O
an O
inferior O
article O
) O
. O
550 O
ankers O
of O
Geneva O
. O
10,800 O
barrels O
of O
beer O
. O
Most O
statistical O
tables O
are O
parchingly O
dry O
in O
the O
reading O
; O
not O
so O
in O
the O
present O
case O
, O
however O
, O
where O
the O
reader O
is O
flooded O
with O
whole O
pipes O
, O
barrels O
, O
quarts O
, O
and O
gills O
of O
good O
gin O
and O
good O
cheer O
. O
At O
the O
time O
, O
I O
devoted O
three O
days O
to O
the O
studious O
digesting O
of O
all O
this O
beer O
, O
beef O
, O
and O
bread O
, O
during O
which O
many O
profound O
thoughts O
were O
incidentally O
suggested O
to O
me O
, O
capable O
of O
a O
transcendental O
and O
Platonic O
application O
; O
and O
, O
furthermore O
, O
I O
compiled O
supplementary O
tables O
of O
my O
own O
, O
touching O
the O
probable O
quantity O
of O
stock-fish O
, O
& O
c. O
, O
consumed O
by O
every O
Low O
Dutch O
harpooneer O
in O
that O
ancient O
Greenland O
and O
Spitzbergen O
whale O
fishery O
. O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
butter O
, O
and O
Texel O
and O
Leyden O
cheese O
consumed O
, O
seems O
amazing O
. O
I O
impute O
it O
, O
though O
, O
to O
their O
naturally O
unctuous O
natures O
, O
being O
rendered O
still O
more O
unctuous O
by O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
vocation O
, O
and O
especially O
by O
their O
pursuing O
their O
game O
in O
those O
frigid O
Polar O
Seas O
, O
on O
the O
very O
coasts O
of O
that O
Esquimaux O
country O
where O
the O
convivial O
natives O
pledge O
each O
other O
in O
bumpers O
of O
train O
oil O
. O
The O
quantity O
of O
the O
beer O
, O
too O
, O
is O
very O
large O
, O
10,800 O
barrels O
. O
Now O
, O
as O
those O
polar O
fisheries O
could O
only O
be O
prosecuted O
in O
the O
short O
summer O
of O
that O
climate O
, O
so O
that O
the O
whole O
cruise O
of O
one O
of O
these O
Dutch O
whalemen O
, O
including O
the O
short O
voyage O
to O
and O
from O
the O
Spitzbergen O
sea O
, O
did O
not O
much O
exceed O
three O
months O
, O
say O
, O
and O
reckoning O
30 O
men O
to O
each O
of O
their O
fleet O
of O
180 O
sail O
, O
we O
have O
5,400 O
Low O
Dutch O
seamen O
in O
all O
; O
therefore O
, O
I O
say O
, O
we O
have O
precisely O
two O
barrels O
of O
beer O
per O
man O
, O
for O
a O
twelve O
weeks O
' O
allowance O
, O
exclusive O
of O
his O
fair O
proportion O
of O
that O
550 O
ankers O
of O
gin O
. O
Now O
, O
whether O
these O
gin O
and O
beer O
harpooneers O
, O
so O
fuddled O
as O
one O
might O
fancy O
them O
to O
have O
been O
, O
were O
the O
right O
sort O
of O
men O
to O
stand O
up O
in O
a O
boat O
's O
head O
, O
and O
take O
good O
aim O
at O
flying O
whales O
; O
this O
would O
seem O
somewhat O
improbable O
. O
Yet O
they O
did O
aim O
at O
them O
, O
and O
hit O
them O
too O
. O
But O
this O
was O
very O
far O
North O
, O
be O
it O
remembered O
, O
where O
beer O
agrees O
well O
with O
the O
constitution O
; O
upon O
the O
Equator O
, O
in O
our O
southern O
fishery O
, O
beer O
