That O
for O
six O
thousand O
years—and O
no O
one O
knows O
how O
many O
millions O
of O
ages O
before—the O
great O
whales O
should O
have O
been O
spouting O
all O
over O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
sprinkling O
and O
mistifying O
the O
gardens O
of O
the O
deep O
, O
as O
with O
so O
many O
sprinkling O
or O
mistifying O
pots O
; O
and O
that O
for O
some O
centuries O
back O
, O
thousands O
of O
hunters O
should O
have O
been O
close O
by O
the O
fountain O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
watching O
these O
sprinklings O
and O
spoutings— O
that O
all O
this O
should O
be O
, O
and O
yet O
, O
that O
down O
to O
this O
blessed O
minute O
( O
fifteen O
and O
a O
quarter O
minutes O
past O
one O
o'clock O
P.M. O
of O
this O
sixteenth O
day O
of O
December O
, O
A.D O
. O
1851 O
) O
, O
it O
should O
still O
remain O
a O
problem O
, O
whether O
these O
spoutings O
are O
, O
after O
all O
, O
really O
water O
, O
or O
nothing O
but O
vapor—this O
is O
surely O
a O
noteworthy O
thing O
. O
Let O
us O
, O
then O
, O
look O
at O
this O
matter O
, O
along O
with O
some O
interesting O
items O
contingent O
. O
Every O
one O
knows O
that O
by O
the O
peculiar O
cunning O
of O
their O
gills O
, O
the O
finny O
tribes O
in O
general O
breathe O
the O
air O
which O
at O
all O
times O
is O
combined O
with O
the O
element O
in O
which O
they O
swim O
; O
hence O
, O
a O
herring O
or O
a O
cod O
might O
live O
a O
century O
, O
and O
never O
once O
raise O
its O
head O
above O
the O
surface O
. O
But O
owing O
to O
his O
marked O
internal O
structure O
which O
gives O
him O
regular O
lungs O
, O
like O
a O
human O
being O
's O
, O
the O
whale O
can O
only O
live O
by O
inhaling O
the O
disengaged O
air O
in O
the O
open O
atmosphere O
. O
Wherefore O
the O
necessity O
for O
his O
periodical O
visits O
to O
the O
upper O
world O
. O
But O
he O
can O
not O
in O
any O
degree O
breathe O
through O
his O
mouth O
, O
for O
, O
in O
his O
ordinary O
attitude O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
mouth O
is O
buried O
at O
least O
eight O
feet O
beneath O
the O
surface O
; O
and O
what O
is O
still O
more O
, O
his O
windpipe O
has O
no O
connexion O
with O
his O
mouth O
. O
No O
, O
he O
breathes O
through O
his O
spiracle O
alone O
; O
and O
this O
is O
on O
the O
top O
of O
his O
head O
. O
If O
I O
say O
, O
that O
in O
any O
creature O
breathing O
is O
only O
a O
function O
indispensable O
to O
vitality O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
withdraws O
from O
the O
air O
a O
certain O
element O
, O
which O
being O
subsequently O
brought O
into O
contact O
with O
the O
blood O
imparts O
to O
the O
blood O
its O
vivifying O
principle O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
shall O
err O
; O
though O
I O
may O
possibly O
use O
some O
superfluous O
scientific O
words O
. O
Assume O
it O
, O
and O
it O
follows O
that O
if O
all O
the O
blood O
in O
a O
man O
could O
be O
aerated O
with O
one O
breath O
, O
he O
might O
then O
seal O
up O
his O
nostrils O
and O
not O
fetch O
another O
for O
a O
considerable O
time O
. O
That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
he O
would O
then O
live O
without O
breathing O
. O
Anomalous O
as O
it O
may O
seem O
, O
this O
is O
precisely O
the O
case O
with O
the O
whale O
, O
who O
systematically O
lives O
, O
by O
intervals O
, O
his O
full O
hour O
and O
more O
( O
when O
at O
the O
bottom O
) O
without O
drawing O
a O
single O
breath O
, O
or O
so O
much O
as O
in O
any O
way O
inhaling O
a O
particle O
of O
air O
; O
for O
, O
remember O
, O
he O
has O
no O
gills O
. O
How O
is O
this O
? O
Between O
his O
ribs O
and O
on O
each O
side O
of O
his O
spine O
he O
is O
supplied O
with O
a O
remarkable O
involved O
Cretan O
labyrinth O
of O
vermicelli-like O
vessels O
, O
which O
vessels O
, O
when O
he O
quits O
the O
surface O
, O
are O
completely O
distended O
with O
oxygenated O
blood O
. O
So O
that O
for O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
, O
a O
thousand O
fathoms O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
he O
carries O
a O
surplus O
stock O
of O
vitality O
in O
him O
, O
just O
as O
the O
camel O
crossing O
the O
waterless O
desert O
carries O
a O
surplus O
supply O
of O
drink O
for O
future O
use O
in O
its O
four O
supplementary O
stomachs O
. O
The O
anatomical O
fact O
of O
this O
labyrinth O
is O
indisputable O
; O
and O
that O
the O
supposition O
founded O
upon O
it O
is O
reasonable O
and O
true O
, O
seems O
the O
more O
cogent O
to O
me O
, O
when O
I O
consider O
the O
otherwise O
inexplicable O
obstinacy O
of O
that O
leviathan O
in O
having O
his O
spoutings O
out O
, O
as O
the O
fishermen O
phrase O
it O
. O
This O
is O
what O
I O
mean O
. O
If O
unmolested O
, O
upon O
rising O
to O
the O
surface O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
will O
continue O
there O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
exactly O
uniform O
with O
all O
his O
other O
unmolested O
risings O
. O
Say O
he O
stays O
eleven O
minutes O
, O
and O
jets O
seventy O
times O
, O
that O
is O
, O
respires O
seventy O
breaths O
; O
then O
whenever O
he O
rises O
again O
, O
he O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
have O
his O
seventy O
breaths O
over O
again O
, O
to O
a O
minute O
. O
Now O
, O
if O
after O
he O
fetches O
a O
few O
breaths O
you O
alarm O
him O
, O
so O
that O
he O
sounds O
, O
he O
will O
be O
always O
dodging O
up O
again O
to O
make O
good O
his O
regular O
allowance O
of O
air O
. O
And O
not O
till O
those O
seventy O
breaths O
are O
told O
, O
will O
he O
finally O
go O
down O
to O
stay O
out O
his O
full O
term O
below O
. O
Remark O
, O
however O
, O
that O
in O
different O
individuals O
these O
rates O
are O
different O
; O
but O
in O
any O
one O
they O
are O
alike O
. O
Now O
, O
why O
should O
the O
whale O
thus O
insist O
upon O
having O
his O
spoutings O
out O
, O
unless O
it O
be O
to O
replenish O
his O
reservoir O
of O
air O
, O
ere O
descending O
for O
good O
? O
How O
obvious O
it O
is O
it O
, O
too O
, O
that O
this O
necessity O
for O
the O
whale O
's O
rising O
exposes O
him O
to O
all O
the O
fatal O
hazards O
of O
the O
chase O
. O
For O
not O
by O
hook O
or O
by O
net O
could O
this O
vast O
leviathan O
be O
caught O
, O
when O
sailing O
a O
thousand O
fathoms O
beneath O
the O
sunlight O
. O
Not O
so O
much O
thy O
skill O
, O
then O
, O
O O
hunter O
, O
as O
the O
great O
necessities O
that O
strike O
the O
victory O
to O
thee O
! O
In O
man O
, O
breathing O
is O
incessantly O
going O
on—one O
breath O
only O
serving O
for O
two O
or O
three O
pulsations O
; O
so O
that O
whatever O
other O
business O
he O
has O
to O
attend O
to O
, O
waking O
or O
sleeping O
, O
breathe O
he O
must O
, O
or O
die O
he O
will O
. O
But O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
only O
breathes O
about O
one O
seventh O
or O
Sunday O
of O
his O
time O
. O
It O
has O
been O
said O
that O
the O
whale O
only O
breathes O
through O
his O
spout-hole O
; O
if O
it O
could O
truthfully O
be O
added O
that O
his O
spouts O
are O
mixed O
with O
water O
, O
then O
I O
opine O
we O
should O
be O
furnished O
with O
the O
reason O
why O
his O
sense O
of O
smell O
seems O
obliterated O
in O
him O
; O
for O
the O
only O
thing O
about O
him O
that O
at O
all O
answers O
to O
his O
nose O
is O
that O
identical O
spout-hole O
; O
and O
being O
so O
clogged O
with O
two O
elements O
, O
it O
could O
not O
be O
expected O
to O
have O
the O
power O
of O
smelling O
. O
But O
owing O
to O
the O
mystery O
of O
the O
spout—whether O
it O
be O
water O
or O
whether O
it O
be O
vapor—no O
absolute O
certainty O
can O
as O
yet O
be O
arrived O
at O
on O
this O
head O
. O
Sure O
it O
is O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
that O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
has O
no O
proper O
olfactories O
. O
But O
what O
does O
he O
want O
of O
them O
? O
No O
roses O
, O
no O
violets O
, O
no O
Cologne-water O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
Furthermore O
, O
as O
his O
windpipe O
solely O
opens O
into O
the O
tube O
of O
his O
spouting O
canal O
, O
and O
as O
that O
long O
canal—like O
the O
grand O
Erie O
Canal— O
is O
furnished O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
locks O
( O
that O
open O
and O
shut O
) O
for O
the O
downward O
retention O
of O
air O
or O
the O
upward O
exclusion O
of O
water O
, O
therefore O
the O
whale O
has O
no O
voice O
; O
unless O
you O
insult O
him O
by O
saying O
, O
that O
when O
he O
so O
strangely O
rumbles O
, O
he O
talks O
through O
his O
nose O
. O
But O
then O
again O
, O
what O
has O
the O
whale O
to O
say O
? O
Seldom O
have O
I O
known O
any O
profound O
being O
that O
had O
anything O
to O
say O
to O
this O
world O
, O
unless O
forced O
to O
stammer O
out O
something O
by O
way O
of O
getting O
a O
living O
. O
Oh O
! O
happy O
that O
the O
world O
is O
such O
an O
excellent O
listener O
! O
Now O
, O
the O
spouting O
canal O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
chiefly O
intended O
as O
it O
is O
for O
the O
conveyance O
of O
air O
, O
and O
for O
several O
feet O
laid O
along O
, O
horizontally O
, O
just O
beneath O
the O
upper O
surface O
of O
his O
head O
, O
and O
a O
little O
to O
one O
side O
; O
this O
curious O
canal O
is O
very O
much O
like O
a O
gas-pipe O
laid O
down O
in O
a O
city O
on O
one O
side O
of O
a O
street O
. O
But O
the O
question O
returns O
whether O
this O
gas-pipe O
is O
also O
a O
water-pipe O
; O
in O
other O
words O
, O
whether O
the O
spout O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
the O
mere O
vapor O
of O
the O
exhaled O
breath O
, O
or O
whether O
that O
exhaled O
breath O
is O
mixed O
with O
water O
taken O
in O
at O
the O
mouth O
, O
and O
discharged O
through O
the O
spiracle O
. O
It O
is O
certain O
that O
the O
mouth O
indirectly O
communicates O
with O
the O
spouting O
canal O
; O
but O
it O
can O
not O
be O
proved O
that O
this O
is O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
discharging O
water O
through O
the O
spiracle O
. O
Because O
the O
greatest O
necessity O
for O
so O
doing O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
, O
when O
in O
feeding O
he O
accidentally O
takes O
in O
water O
. O
But O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
food O
is O
far O
beneath O
the O
surface O
, O
and O
there O
he O
can O
not O
spout O
even O
if O
he O
would O
. O
Besides O
, O
if O
you O
regard O
him O
very O
closely O
, O
and O
time O
him O
with O
your O
watch O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
when O
unmolested O
, O
there O
is O
an O
undeviating O
rhyme O
between O
the O
periods O
of O
his O
jets O
and O
the O
ordinary O
periods O
of O
respiration O
. O
But O
why O
pester O
one O
with O
all O
this O
reasoning O
on O
the O
subject O
? O
Speak O
out O
! O
You O
have O
seen O
him O
spout O
; O
then O
declare O
what O
the O
spout O
is O
; O
can O
you O
not O
tell O
water O
from O
air O
? O
My O
dear O
sir O
, O
in O
this O
world O
it O
is O
not O
so O
easy O
to O
settle O
these O
plain O
things O
. O
I O
have O
ever O
found O
your O
plain O
things O
the O
knottiest O
of O
all O
. O
And O
as O
for O
this O
whale O
spout O
, O
you O
might O
almost O
stand O
in O
it O
, O
and O
yet O
be O
undecided O
as O
to O
what O
it O
is O
precisely O
. O
The O
central O
body O
of O
it O
is O
hidden O
in O
the O
snowy O
sparkling O
mist O
enveloping O
it O
; O
and O
how O
can O
you O
certainly O
tell O
whether O
any O
water O
falls O
from O
it O
, O
when O
, O
always O
, O
when O
you O
are O
close O
enough O
to O
a O
whale O
to O
get O
a O
close O
view O
of O
his O
spout O
, O
he O
is O
in O
a O
prodigious O
commotion O
, O
the O
water O
cascading O
all O
around O
him O
. O
And O
if O
at O
such O
times O
you O
should O
think O
that O
you O
really O
perceived O
drops O
of O
moisture O
in O
the O
spout O
, O
how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
they O
are O
not O
merely O
condensed O
from O
its O
vapor O
; O
or O
how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
they O
are O
not O
those O
identical O
drops O
superficially O
lodged O
in O
the O
spout-hole O
fissure O
, O
which O
is O
countersunk O
into O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
head O
? O
For O
even O
when O
tranquilly O
swimming O
through O
the O
mid-day O
sea O
in O
a O
calm O
, O
with O
his O
elevated O
hump O
sun-dried O
as O
a O
dromedary O
's O
in O
the O
desert O
; O
even O
then O
, O
the O
whale O
always O
carries O
a O
small O
basin O
of O
water O
on O
his O
head O
, O
as O
under O
a O
blazing O
sun O
you O
will O
sometimes O
see O
a O
cavity O
in O
a O
rock O
filled O
up O
with O
rain O
. O
Nor O
is O
it O
at O
all O
prudent O
for O
the O
hunter O
to O
be O
over O
curious O
touching O
the O
precise O
nature O
of O
the O
whale O
spout O
. O
It O
will O
not O
do O
for O
him O
to O
be O
peering O
into O
it O
, O
and O
putting O
his O
face O
in O
it O
. O
You O
can O
not O
go O
with O
your O
pitcher O
to O
this O
fountain O
and O
fill O
it O
, O
and O
bring O
it O
away O
. O
For O
even O
when O
coming O
into O
slight O
contact O
with O
the O
outer O
, O
vapory O
shreds O
of O
the O
jet O
, O
which O
will O
often O
happen O
, O
your O
skin O
will O
feverishly O
smart O
, O
from O
the O
acridness O
of O
the O
thing O
so O
touching O
it O
. O
And O
I O
know O
one O
, O
who O
coming O
into O
still O
closer O
contact O
with O
the O
spout O
, O
whether O
with O
some O
scientific O
object O
in O
view O
, O
or O
otherwise O
, O
I O
can O
not O
say O
, O
the O
skin O
peeled O
off O
from O
his O
cheek O
and O
arm O
. O
Wherefore O
, O
among O
whalemen O
, O
the O
spout O
is O
deemed O
poisonous O
; O
they O
try O
to O
evade O
it O
. O
Another O
thing O
; O
I O
have O
heard O
it O
said O
, O
and O
I O
do O
not O
much O
doubt O
it O
, O
that O
if O
the O
jet O
is O
fairly O
spouted O
into O
your O
eyes O
, O
it O
will O
blind O
you O
. O
The O
wisest O
thing O
the O
investigator O
can O
do O
then O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
, O
is O
to O
let O
this O
deadly O
spout O
alone O
. O
Still O
, O
we O
can O
hypothesize O
, O
even O
if O
we O
can O
not O
prove O
and O
establish O
. O
My O
hypothesis O
is O
this O
: O
that O
the O
spout O
is O
nothing O
but O
mist O
. O
And O
besides O
other O
reasons O
, O
to O
this O
conclusion O
I O
am O
impelled O
, O
by O
considerations O
touching O
the O
great O
inherent O
dignity O
and O
sublimity O
of O
the O

; O
I O
account O
him O
no O
common O
, O
shallow O
being O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
it O
is O
an O
undisputed O
fact O
that O
he O
is O
never O
found O
on O
soundings O
, O
or O
near O
shores O
; O
all O
other O
whales O
sometimes O
are O
. O
He O
is O
both O
ponderous O
and O
profound O
. O
And O
I O
am O
convinced O
that O
from O
the O
heads O
of O
all O
ponderous O
profound O
beings O
, O
such O
as O
Plato O
, O
Pyrrho O
, O
the O
Devil O
, O
Jupiter O
, O
Dante O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
there O
always O
goes O
up O
a O
certain O
semi-visible O
steam O
, O
while O
in O
the O
act O
of O
thinking O
deep O
thoughts O
. O
While O
composing O
a O
little O
treatise O
on O
Eternity O
, O
I O
had O
the O
curiosity O
to O
place O
a O
mirror O
before O
me O
; O
and O
ere O
long O
saw O
reflected O
there O
, O
a O
curious O
involved O
worming O
and O
undulation O
in O
the O
atmosphere O
over O
my O
head O
. O
The O
invariable O
moisture O
of O
my O
hair O
, O
while O
plunged O
in O
deep O
thought O
, O
after O
six O
cups O
of O
hot O
tea O
in O
my O
thin O
shingled O
attic O
, O
of O
an O
August O
noon O
; O
this O
seems O
an O
additional O
argument O
for O
the O
above O
supposition O
. O
And O
how O
nobly O
it O
raises O
our O
conceit O
of O
the O
mighty O
, O
misty O
monster O
, O
to O
behold O
him O
solemnly O
sailing O
through O
a O
calm O
tropical O
sea O
; O
his O
vast O
, O
mild O
head O
overhung O
by O
a O
canopy O
of O
vapor O
, O
engendered O
by O
his O
incommunicable O
contemplations O
, O
and O
that O
vapor— O
as O
you O
will O
sometimes O
see O
it—glorified O
by O
a O
rainbow O
, O
as O
if O
Heaven O
itself O
had O
put O
its O
seal O
upon O
his O
thoughts O
. O
For O
d O
'ye O
see O
, O
rainbows O
do O
not O
visit O
the O
clear O
air O
; O
they O
only O
irradiate O
vapor O
. O
And O
so O
, O
through O
all O
the O
thick O
mists O
of O
the O
dim O
doubts O
in O
my O
mind O
, O
divine O
intuitions O
now O
and O
then O
shoot O
, O
enkindling O
my O
fog O
with O
a O
heavenly O
ray O
. O
And O
for O
this O
I O
thank O
God O
; O
for O
all O
have O
doubts O
; O
many O
deny O
; O
but O
doubts O
or O
denials O
, O
few O
along O
with O
them O
, O
have O
intuitions O
. O
Doubts O
of O
all O
things O
earthly O
, O
and O
intuitions O
of O
some O
things O
heavenly O
; O
this O
combination O
makes O
neither O
believer O
nor O
infidel O
, O
but O
makes O
a O
man O
who O
regards O
them O
both O
with O
equal O
eye O
. O
