Now O
comes O
the O
Baling O
of O
the O
Case O
. O
But O
to O
comprehend O
it O
aright O
, O
you O
must O
know O
something O
of O
the O
curious O
internal O
structure O
of O
the O
thing O
operated O
upon O
. O
Regarding O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
head O
as O
a O
solid O
oblong O
, O
you O
may O
, O
on O
an O
inclined O
plane O
, O
sideways O
divide O
it O
into O
two O
quoins O
, O
* O
whereof O
the O
lower O
is O
the O
bony O
structure O
, O
forming O
the O
cranium O
and O
jaws O
, O
and O
the O
upper O
an O
unctuous O
mass O
wholly O
free O
from O
bones O
; O
its O
broad O
forward O
end O
forming O
the O
expanded O
vertical O
apparent O
forehead O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
At O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
forehead O
horizontally O
subdivide O
this O
upper O
quoin O
, O
and O
then O
you O
have O
two O
almost O
equal O
parts O
, O
which O
before O
were O
naturally O
divided O
by O
an O
internal O
wall O
of O
a O
thick O
tendinous O
substance O
. O
* O
Quoin O
is O
not O
a O
Euclidean O
term O
. O
It O
belongs O
to O
the O
pure O
nautical O
mathematics O
. O
I O
know O
not O
that O
it O
has O
been O
defined O
before O
. O
A O
quoin O
is O
a O
solid O
which O
differs O
from O
a O
wedge O
in O
having O
its O
sharp O
end O
formed O
by O
the O
steep O
inclination O
of O
one O
side O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
mutual O
tapering O
of O
both O
sides O
. O
The O
lower O
subdivided O
part O
, O
called O
the O
junk O
, O
is O
one O
immense O
honeycomb O
of O
oil O
, O
formed O
by O
the O
crossing O
and O
recrossing O
, O
into O
ten O
thousand O
infiltrated O
cells O
, O
of O
tough O
elastic O
white O
fibres O
throughout O
its O
whole O
extent O
. O
The O
upper O
part O
, O
known O
as O
the O
Case O
, O
may O
be O
regarded O
as O
the O
great O
Heidelburgh O
Tun O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
. O
And O
as O
that O
famous O
great O
tierce O
is O
mystically O
carved O
in O
front O
, O
so O
the O
whale O
's O
vast O
plaited O
forehead O
forms O
innumerable O
strange O
devices O
for O
the O
emblematical O
adornment O
of O
his O
wondrous O
tun O
. O
Moreover O
, O
as O
that O
of O
Heidelburgh O
was O
always O
replenished O
with O
the O
most O
excellent O
of O
the O
wines O
of O
the O
Rhenish O
valleys O
, O
so O
the O
tun O
of O
the O
whale O
contains O
by O
far O
the O
most O
precious O
of O
all O
his O
oily O
vintages O
; O
namely O
, O
the O
highly-prized O
spermaceti O
, O
in O
its O
absolutely O
pure O
, O
limpid O
, O
and O
odoriferous O
state O
. O
Nor O
is O
this O
precious O
substance O
found O
unalloyed O
in O
any O
other O
part O
of O
the O
creature O
. O
Though O
in O
life O
it O
remains O
perfectly O
fluid O
, O
yet O
, O
upon O
exposure O
to O
the O
air O
, O
after O
death O
, O
it O
soon O
begins O
to O
concrete O
; O
sending O
forth O
beautiful O
crystalline O
shoots O
, O
as O
when O
the O
first O
thin O
delicate O
ice O
is O
just O
forming O
in O
water O
. O
A O
large O
whale O
's O
case O
generally O
yields O
about O
five O
hundred O
gallons O
of O
sperm O
, O
though O
from O
unavoidable O
circumstances O
, O
considerable O
of O
it O
is O
spilled O
, O
leaks O
, O
and O
dribbles O
away O
, O
or O
is O
otherwise O
irrevocably O
lost O
in O
the O
ticklish O
business O
of O
securing O
what O
you O
can O
. O
I O
know O
not O
with O
what O
fine O
and O
costly O
material O
the O
Heidelburgh O
Tun O
was O
coated O
within O
, O
but O
in O
superlative O
richness O
that O
coating O
could O
not O
possibly O
have O
compared O
with O
the O
silken O
pearl-colored O
membrane O
, O
like O
the O
lining O
of O
a O
fine O
pelisse O
, O
forming O
the O
inner O
surface O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
case O
. O
It O
will O
have O
been O
seen O
that O
the O
Heidelburgh O
Tun O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
embraces O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
the O
entire O
top O
of O
the O
head O
; O
and O
since—as O
has O
been O
elsewhere O
set O
forth—the O
head O
embraces O
one O
third O
of O
the O
whole O
length O
of O
the O
creature O
, O
then O
setting O
that O
length O
down O
at O
eighty O
feet O
for O
a O
good O
sized O
whale O
, O
you O
have O
more O
than O
twenty-six O
feet O
for O
the O
depth O
of O
the O
tun O
, O
when O
it O
is O
lengthwise O
hoisted O
up O
and O
down O
against O
a O
ship O
's O
side O
. O
As O
in O
decapitating O
the O
whale O
, O
the O
operator O
's O
instrument O
is O
brought O
close O
to O
the O
spot O
where O
an O
entrance O
is O
subsequently O
forced O
into O
the O
spermaceti O
magazine O
; O
he O
has O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
be O
uncommonly O
heedful O
, O
lest O
a O
careless O
, O
untimely O
stroke O
should O
invade O
the O
sanctuary O
and O
wastingly O
let O
out O
its O
invaluable O
contents O
. O
It O
is O
this O
decapitated O
end O
of O
the O
head O
, O
also O
, O
which O
is O
at O
last O
elevated O
out O
of O
the O
water O
, O
and O
retained O
in O
that O
position O
by O
the O
enormous O
cutting O
tackles O
, O
whose O
hempen O
combinations O
, O
on O
one O
side O
, O
make O
quite O
a O
wilderness O
of O
ropes O
in O
that O
quarter O
. O
Thus O
much O
being O
said O
, O
attend O
now O
, O
I O
pray O
you O
, O
to O
that O
marvellous O
and— O
in O
this O
particular O
instance—almost O
fatal O
operation O
whereby O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
great O
Heidelburgh O
Tun O
is O
tapped O
. O
