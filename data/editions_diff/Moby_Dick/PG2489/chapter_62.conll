A O
word O
concerning O
an O
incident O
in O
the O
last O
chapter O
. O
According O
to O
the O
invariable O
usage O
of O
the O
fishery O
, O
the O
whale-boat O
pushes O
off O
from O
the O
ship O
, O
with O
the O
headsman O
or O
whale-killer O
as O
temporary O
steersman O
, O
and O
the O
harpooneer O
or O
whale-fastener O
pulling O
the O
foremost O
oar O
, O
the O
one O
known O
as O
the O
harpooneer-oar O
. O
Now O
it O
needs O
a O
strong O
, O
nervous O
arm O
to O
strike O
the O
first O
iron O
into O
the O
fish O
; O
for O
often O
, O
in O
what O
is O
called O
a O
long O
dart O
, O
the O
heavy O
implement O
has O
to O
be O
flung O
to O
the O
distance O
of O
twenty O
or O
thirty O
feet O
. O
But O
however O
prolonged O
and O
exhausting O
the O
chase O
, O
the O
harpooneer O
is O
expected O
to O
pull O
his O
oar O
meanwhile O
to O
the O
uttermost O
; O
indeed O
, O
he O
is O
expected O
to O
set O
an O
example O
of O
superhuman O
activity O
to O
the O
rest O
, O
not O
only O
by O
incredible O
rowing O
, O
but O
by O
repeated O
loud O
and O
intrepid O
exclamations O
; O
and O
what O
it O
is O
to O
keep O
shouting O
at O
the O
top O
of O
one O
's O
compass O
, O
while O
all O
the O
other O
muscles O
are O
strained O
and O
half O
started— O
what O
that O
is O
none O
know O
but O
those O
who O
have O
tried O
it O
. O
For O
one O
, O
I O
can O
not O
bawl O
very O
heartily O
and O
work O
very O
recklessly O
at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
time O
. O
In O
this O
straining O
, O
bawling O
state O
, O
then O
, O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
fish O
, O
all O
at O
once O
the O
exhausted O
harpooneer O
hears O
the O
exciting O
cry— O
" O
Stand O
up O
, O
and O
give O
it O
to O
him O
! O
" O
He O
now O
has O
to O
drop O
and O
secure O
his O
oar O
, O
turn O
round O
on O
his O
centre O
half O
way O
, O
seize O
his O
harpoon O
from O
the O
crotch O
, O
and O
with O
what O
little O
strength O
may O
remain O
, O
he O
essays O
to O
pitch O
it O
somehow O
into O
the O
whale O
. O
No O
wonder O
, O
taking O
the O
whole O
fleet O
of O
whalemen O
in O
a O
body O
, O
that O
out O
of O
fifty O
fair O
chances O
for O
a O
dart O
, O
not O
five O
are O
successful O
; O
no O
wonder O
that O
so O
many O
hapless O
harpooneers O
are O
madly O
cursed O
and O
disrated O
; O
no O
wonder O
that O
some O
of O
them O
actually O
burst O
their O
blood-vessels O
in O
the O
boat O
; O
no O
wonder O
that O
some O
sperm O
whalemen O
are O
absent O
four O
years O
with O
four O
barrels O
; O
no O
wonder O
that O
to O
many O
ship O
owners O
, O
whaling O
is O
but O
a O
losing O
concern O
; O
for O
it O
is O
the O
harpooneer O
that O
makes O
the O
voyage O
, O
and O
if O
you O
take O
the O
breath O
out O
of O
his O
body O
how O
can O
you O
expect O
to O
find O
it O
there O
when O
most O
wanted O
! O
Again O
, O
if O
the O
dart O
be O
successful O
, O
then O
at O
the O
second O
critical O
instant O
, O
that O
is O
, O
when O
the O
whale O
starts O
to O
run O
, O
the O
boatheader O
and O
harpooneer O
likewise O
start O
to O
running O
fore O
and O
aft O
, O
to O
the O
imminent O
jeopardy O
of O
themselves O
and O
every O
one O
else O
. O
It O
is O
then O
they O
change O
places O
; O
and O
the O
headsman O
, O
the O
chief O
officer O
of O
the O
little O
craft O
, O
takes O
his O
proper O
station O
in O
the O
bows O
of O
the O
boat O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
care O
not O
who O
maintains O
the O
contrary O
, O
but O
all O
this O
is O
both O
foolish O
and O
unnecessary O
. O
The O
headsman O
should O
stay O
in O
the O
bows O
from O
first O
to O
last O
; O
he O
should O
both O
dart O
the O
harpoon O
and O
the O
lance O
, O
and O
no O
rowing O
whatever O
should O
be O
expected O
of O
him O
, O
except O
under O
circumstances O
obvious O
to O
any O
fisherman O
. O
I O
know O
that O
this O
would O
sometimes O
involve O
a O
slight O
loss O
of O
speed O
in O
the O
chase O
; O
but O
long O
experience O
in O
various O
whalemen O
of O
more O
than O
one O
nation O
has O
convinced O
me O
that O
in O
the O
vast O
majority O
of O
failures O
in O
the O
fishery O
, O
it O
has O
not O
by O
any O
means O
been O
so O
much O
the O
speed O
of O
the O
whale O
as O
the O
before O
described O
exhaustion O
of O
the O
harpooneer O
that O
has O
caused O
them O
. O
To O
insure O
the O
greatest O
efficiency O
in O
the O
dart O
, O
the O
harpooneers O
of O
this O
world O
must O
start O
to O
their O
feet O
from O
out O
of O
idleness O
, O
and O
not O
from O
out O
of O
toil O
. O
