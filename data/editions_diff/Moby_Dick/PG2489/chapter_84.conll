To O
make O
them O
run O
easily O
and O
swiftly O
, O
the O
axles O
of O
carriages O
are O
anointed O
; O
and O
for O
much O
the O
same O
purpose O
, O
some O
whalers O
perform O
an O
analogous O
operation O
upon O
their O
boat O
; O
they O
grease O
the O
bottom O
. O
Nor O
is O
it O
to O
be O
doubted O
that O
as O
such O
a O
procedure O
can O
do O
no O
harm O
, O
it O
may O
possibly O
be O
of O
no O
contemptible O
advantage O
; O
considering O
that O
oil O
and O
water O
are O
hostile O
; O
that O
oil O
is O
a O
sliding O
thing O
, O
and O
that O
the O
object O
in O
view O
is O
to O
make O
the O
boat O
slide O
bravely O
. O
Queequeg O
believed O
strongly O
in O
anointing O
his O
boat O
, O
and O
one O
morning O
not O
long O
after O
the O
German O
ship O
Jungfrau O
disappeared O
, O
took O
more O
than O
customary O
pains O
in O
that O
occupation O
; O
crawling O
under O
its O
bottom O
, O
where O
it O
hung O
over O
the O
side O
, O
and O
rubbing O
in O
the O
unctuousness O
as O
though O
diligently O
seeking O
to O
insure O
a O
crop O
of O
hair O
from O
the O
craft O
's O
bald O
keel O
. O
He O
seemed O
to O
be O
working O
in O
obedience O
to O
some O
particular O
presentiment O
. O
Nor O
did O
it O
remain O
unwarranted O
by O
the O
event O
. O
Towards O
noon O
whales O
were O
raised O
; O
but O
so O
soon O
as O
the O
ship O
sailed O
down O
to O
them O
, O
they O
turned O
and O
fled O
with O
swift O
precipitancy O
; O
a O
disordered O
flight O
, O
as O
of O
Cleopatra O
's O
barges O
from O
Actium O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
boats O
pursued O
, O
and O
Stubb O
's O
was O
foremost O
. O
By O
great O
exertion O
, O
Tashtego O
at O
last O
succeeded O
in O
planting O
one O
iron O
; O
but O
the O
stricken O
whale O
, O
without O
at O
all O
sounding O
, O
still O
continued O
his O
horizontal O
flight O
, O
with O
added O
fleetness O
. O
Such O
unintermitted O
strainings O
upon O
the O
planted O
iron O
must O
sooner O
or O
later O
inevitably O
extract O
it O
. O
It O
became O
imperative O
to O
lance O
the O
flying O
whale O
, O
or O
be O
content O
to O
lose O
him O
. O
But O
to O
haul O
the O
boat O
up O
to O
his O
flank O
was O
impossible O
, O
he O
swam O
so O
fast O
and O
furious O
. O
What O
then O
remained O
? O
Of O
all O
the O
wondrous O
devices O
and O
dexterities O
, O
the O
sleights O
of O
hand O
and O
countless O
subtleties O
, O
to O
which O
the O
veteran O
whaleman O
is O
so O
often O
forced O
, O
none O
exceed O
that O
fine O
manoeuvre O
with O
the O
lance O
called O
pitchpoling O
. O
Small O
sword O
, O
or O
broad O
sword O
, O
in O
all O
its O
exercises O
boasts O
nothing O
like O
it O
. O
It O
is O
only O
indispensable O
with O
an O
inveterate O
running O
whale O
; O
its O
grand O
fact O
and O
feature O
is O
the O
wonderful O
distance O
to O
which O
the O
long O
lance O
is O
accurately O
darted O
from O
a O
violently O
rocking O
, O
jerking O
boat O
, O
under O
extreme O
headway O
. O
Steel O
and O
wood O
included O
, O
the O
entire O
spear O
is O
some O
ten O
or O
twelve O
feet O
in O
length O
; O
the O
staff O
is O
much O
slighter O
than O
that O
of O
the O
harpoon O
, O
and O
also O
of O
a O
lighter O
materialâ€”pine O
. O
It O
is O
furnished O
with O
a O
small O
rope O
called O
a O
warp O
, O
of O
considerable O
length O
, O
by O
which O
it O
can O
be O
hauled O
back O
to O
the O
hand O
after O
darting O
. O
But O
before O
going O
further O
, O
it O
is O
important O
to O
mention O
here O
, O
that O
though O
the O
harpoon O
may O
be O
pitchpoled O
in O
the O
same O
way O
with O
the O
lance O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
seldom O
done O
; O
and O
when O
done O
, O
is O
still O
less O
frequently O
successful O
, O
on O
account O
of O
the O
greater O
weight O
and O
inferior O
length O
of O
the O
harpoon O
as O
compared O
with O
the O
lance O
, O
which O
in O
effect O
become O
serious O
drawbacks O
. O
As O
a O
general O
thing O
, O
therefore O
, O
you O
must O
first O
get O
fast O
to O
a O
whale O
, O
before O
any O
pitchpoling O
comes O
into O
play O
. O
Look O
now O
at O
Stubb O
; O
a O
man O
who O
from O
his O
humorous O
, O
deliberate O
coolness O
and O
equanimity O
in O
the O
direst O
emergencies O
, O
was O
specially O
qualified O
to O
excel O
in O
pitchpoling O
. O
Look O
at O
him O
; O
he O
stands O
upright O
in O
the O
tossed O
bow O
of O
the O
flying O
boat O
; O
wrapt O
in O
fleecy O
foam O
, O
the O
towing O
whale O
is O
forty O
feet O
ahead O
. O
Handling O
the O
long O
lance O
lightly O
, O
glancing O
twice O
or O
thrice O
along O
its O
length O
to O
see O
if O
it O
be O
exactly O
straight O
, O
Stubb O
whistlingly O
gathers O
up O
the O
coil O
of O
the O
warp O
in O
one O
hand O
, O
so O
as O
to O
secure O
its O
free O
end O
in O
his O
grasp O
, O
leaving O
the O
rest O
unobstructed O
. O
Then O
holding O
the O
lance O
full O
before O
his O
waistband O
's O
middle O
, O
he O
levels O
it O
at O
the O
whale O
; O
when O
, O
covering O
him O
with O
it O
, O
he O
steadily O
depresses O
the O
butt-end O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
thereby O
elevating O
the O
point O
till O
the O
weapon O
stands O
fairly O
balanced O
upon O
his O
palm O
, O
fifteen O
feet O
in O
the O
air O
. O
He O
minds O
you O
somewhat O
of O
a O
juggler O
, O
balancing O
a O
long O
staff O
on O
his O
chin O
. O
Next O
moment O
with O
a O
rapid O
, O
nameless O
impulse O
, O
in O
a O
superb O
lofty O
arch O
the O
bright O
steel O
spans O
the O
foaming O
distance O
, O
and O
quivers O
in O
the O
life O
spot O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
Instead O
of O
sparkling O
water O
, O
he O
now O
spouts O
red O
blood O
. O
" O
That O
drove O
the O
spigot O
out O
of O
him O
! O
" O
cried O
Stubb O
. O
" O
'T O
is O
July O
's O
immortal O
Fourth O
; O
all O
fountains O
must O
run O
wine O
today O
! O
Would O
now O
, O
it O
were O
old O
Orleans O
whiskey O
, O
or O
old O
Ohio O
, O
or O
unspeakable O
old O
Monongahela O
! O
Then O
, O
Tashtego O
, O
lad O
, O
I O
'd O
have O
ye O
hold O
a O
canakin O
to O
the O
jet O
, O
and O
we O
'd O
drink O
round O
it O
! O
Yea O
, O
verily O
, O
hearts O
alive O
, O
we O
'd O
brew O
choice O
punch O
in O
the O
spread O
of O
his O
spout-hole O
there O
, O
and O
from O
that O
live O
punch-bowl O
quaff O
the O
living O
stuff O
. O
" O
Again O
and O
again O
to O
such O
gamesome O
talk O
, O
the O
dexterous O
dart O
is O
repeated O
, O
the O
spear O
returning O
to O
its O
master O
like O
a O
greyhound O
held O
in O
skilful O
leash O
. O
The O
agonized O
whale O
goes O
into O
his O
flurry O
; O
the O
tow-line O
is O
slackened O
, O
and O
the O
pitchpoler O
dropping O
astern O
, O
folds O
his O
hands O
, O
and O
mutely O
watches O
the O
monster O
die O
. O
