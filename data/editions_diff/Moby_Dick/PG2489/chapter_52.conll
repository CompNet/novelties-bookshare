South-eastward O
from O
the O
Cape O
, O
off O
the O
distant O
Crozetts O
, O
a O
good O
cruising O
ground O
for O
Right O
Whalemen O
, O
a O
sail O
loomed O
ahead O
, O
the O
Goney O
( O
Albatross O
) O
by O
name O
. O
As O
she O
slowly O
drew O
nigh O
, O
from O
my O
lofty O
perch O
at O
the O
fore-mast-head O
, O
I O
had O
a O
good O
view O
of O
that O
sight O
so O
remarkable O
to O
a O
tyro O
in O
the O
far O
ocean O
fisheries— O
a O
whaler O
at O
sea O
, O
and O
long O
absent O
from O
home O
. O
As O
if O
the O
waves O
had O
been O
fullers O
, O
this O
craft O
was O
bleached O
like O
the O
skeleton O
of O
a O
stranded O
walrus O
. O
All O
down O
her O
sides O
, O
this O
spectral O
appearance O
was O
traced O
with O
long O
channels O
of O
reddened O
rust O
, O
while O
all O
her O
spars O
and O
her O
rigging O
were O
like O
the O
thick O
branches O
of O
trees O
furred O
over O
with O
hoar-frost O
. O
Only O
her O
lower O
sails O
were O
set O
. O
A O
wild O
sight O
it O
was O
to O
see O
her O
long-bearded O
look-outs O
at O
those O
three O
mast-heads O
. O
They O
seemed O
clad O
in O
the O
skins O
of O
beasts O
, O
so O
torn O
and O
bepatched O
the O
raiment O
that O
had O
survived O
nearly O
four O
years O
of O
cruising O
. O
Standing O
in O
iron O
hoops O
nailed O
to O
the O
mast O
, O
they O
swayed O
and O
swung O
over O
a O
fathomless O
sea O
; O
and O
though O
, O
when O
the O
ship O
slowly O
glided O
close O
under O
our O
stern O
, O
we O
six O
men O
in O
the O
air O
came O
so O
nigh O
to O
each O
other O
that O
we O
might O
almost O
have O
leaped O
from O
the O
mast-heads O
of O
one O
ship O
to O
those O
of O
the O
other O
; O
yet O
, O
those O
forlorn-looking O
fishermen O
, O
mildly O
eyeing O
us O
as O
they O
passed O
, O
said O
not O
one O
word O
to O
our O
own O
look-outs O
, O
while O
the O
quarter-deck O
hail O
was O
being O
heard O
from O
below O
. O
" O
Ship O
ahoy O
! O
Have O
ye O
seen O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
But O
as O
the O
strange O
captain O
, O
leaning O
over O
the O
pallid O
bulwarks O
, O
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
putting O
his O
trumpet O
to O
his O
mouth O
, O
it O
somehow O
fell O
from O
his O
hand O
into O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
the O
wind O
now O
rising O
amain O
, O
he O
in O
vain O
strove O
to O
make O
himself O
heard O
without O
it O
. O
Meantime O
his O
ship O
was O
still O
increasing O
the O
distance O
between O
us O
. O
While O
in O
various O
silent O
ways O
the O
seamen O
of O
the O
Pequod O
were O
evincing O
their O
observance O
of O
this O
ominous O
incident O
at O
the O
first O
mere O
mention O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
's O
name O
to O
another O
ship O
, O
Ahab O
for O
a O
moment O
paused O
; O
it O
almost O
seemed O
as O
though O
he O
would O
have O
lowered O
a O
boat O
to O
board O
the O
stranger O
, O
had O
not O
the O
threatening O
wind O
forbade O
. O
But O
taking O
advantage O
of O
his O
windward O
position O
, O
he O
again O
seized O
his O
trumpet O
, O
and O
knowing O
by O
her O
aspect O
that O
the O
stranger O
vessel O
was O
a O
Nantucketer O
and O
shortly O
bound O
home O
, O
he O
loudly O
hailed— O
" O
Ahoy O
there O
! O
This O
is O
the O
Pequod O
, O
bound O
round O
the O
world O
! O
Tell O
them O
to O
address O
all O
future O
letters O
to O
the O
Pacific O
ocean O
! O
and O
this O
time O
three O
years O
, O
if O
I O
am O
not O
at O
home O
, O
tell O
them O
to O
address O
them O
to- O
" O
At O
that O
moment O
the O
two O
wakes O
were O
fairly O
crossed O
, O
and O
instantly O
, O
then O
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
their O
singular O
ways O
, O
shoals O
of O
small O
harmless O
fish O
, O
that O
for O
some O
days O
before O
had O
been O
placidly O
swimming O
by O
our O
side O
, O
darted O
away O
with O
what O
seemed O
shuddering O
fins O
, O
and O
ranged O
themselves O
fore O
and O
aft O
with O
the O
stranger O
's O
flanks O
. O
Though O
in O
the O
course O
of O
his O
continual O
voyagings O
Ahab O
must O
often O
before O
have O
noticed O
a O
similar O
sight O
, O
yet O
, O
to O
any O
monomaniac O
man O
, O
the O
veriest O
trifles O
capriciously O
carry O
meanings O
. O
" O
Swim O
away O
from O
me O
, O
do O
ye O
? O
" O
murmured O
Ahab O
, O
gazing O
over O
into O
the O
water O
. O
There O
seemed O
but O
little O
in O
the O
words O
, O
but O
the O
tone O
conveyed O
more O
of O
deep O
helpless O
sadness O
than O
the O
insane O
old O
man O
had O
ever O
before O
evinced O
. O
But O
turning O
to O
the O
steersman O
, O
who O
thus O
far O
had O
been O
holding O
the O
ship O
in O
the O
wind O
to O
diminish O
her O
headway O
, O
he O
cried O
out O
in O
his O
old O
lion O
voice O
, O
— O
" O
Up O
helm O
! O
Keep O
her O
off O
round O
the O
world O
! O
" O
Round O
the O
world O
! O
There O
is O
much O
in O
that O
sound O
to O
inspire O
proud O
feelings O
; O
but O
whereto O
does O
all O
that O
circumnavigation O
conduct O
? O
Only O
through O
numberless O
perils O
to O
the O
very O
point O
whence O
we O
started O
, O
where O
those O
that O
we O
left O
behind O
secure O
, O
were O
all O
the O
time O
before O
us O
. O
Were O
this O
world O
an O
endless O
plain O
, O
and O
by O
sailing O
eastward O
we O
could O
for O
ever O
reach O
new O
distances O
, O
and O
discover O
sights O
more O
sweet O
and O
strange O
than O
any O
Cyclades O
or O
Islands O
of O
King O
Solomon O
, O
then O
there O
were O
promise O
in O
the O
voyage O
. O
But O
in O
pursuit O
of O
those O
far O
mysteries O
we O
dream O
of O
, O
or O
in O
tormented O
chase O
of O
that O
demon O
phantom O
that O
, O
some O
time O
or O
other O
, O
swims O
before O
all O
human O
hearts O
; O
while O
chasing O
such O
over O
this O
round O
globe O
, O
they O
either O
lead O
us O
on O
in O
barren O
mazes O
or O
midway O
leave O
us O
whelmed O
. O
