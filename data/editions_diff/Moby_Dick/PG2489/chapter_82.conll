There O
are O
some O
enterprises O
in O
which O
a O
careful O
disorderliness O
is O
the O
true O
method O
. O
The O
more O
I O
dive O
into O
this O
matter O
of O
whaling O
, O
and O
push O
my O
researches O
up O
to O
the O
very O
spring-head O
of O
it O
so O
much O
the O
more O
am O
I O
impressed O
with O
its O
great O
honorableness O
and O
antiquity O
; O
and O
especially O
when O
I O
find O
so O
many O
great O
demi-gods O
and O
heroes O
, O
prophets O
of O
all O
sorts O
, O
who O
one O
way O
or O
other O
have O
shed O
distinction O
upon O
it O
, O
I O
am O
transported O
with O
the O
reflection O
that O
I O
myself O
belong O
, O
though O
but O
subordinately O
, O
to O
so O
emblazoned O
a O
fraternity O
. O
The O
gallant O
Perseus O
, O
a O
son O
of O
Jupiter O
, O
was O
the O
first O
whaleman O
; O
and O
to O
the O
eternal O
honor O
of O
our O
calling O
be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
the O
first O
whale O
attacked O
by O
our O
brotherhood O
was O
not O
killed O
with O
any O
sordid O
intent O
. O
Those O
were O
the O
knightly O
days O
of O
our O
profession O
, O
when O
we O
only O
bore O
arms O
to O
succor O
the O
distressed O
, O
and O
not O
to O
fill O
men O
's O
lamp-feeders O
. O
Every O
one O
knows O
the O
fine O
story O
of O
Perseus O
and O
Andromeda O
; O
how O
the O
lovely O
Andromeda O
, O
the O
daughter O
of O
a O
king O
, O
was O
tied O
to O
a O
rock O
on O
the O
sea-coast O
, O
and O
as O
Leviathan O
was O
in O
the O
very O
act O
of O
carrying O
her O
off O
, O
Perseus O
, O
the O
prince O
of O
whalemen O
, O
intrepidly O
advancing O
, O
harpooned O
the O
monster O
, O
and O
delivered O
and O
married O
the O
maid O
. O
It O
was O
an O
admirable O
artistic O
exploit O
, O
rarely O
achieved O
by O
the O
best O
harpooneers O
of O
the O
present O
day O
; O
inasmuch O
as O
this O
Leviathan O
was O
slain O
at O
the O
very O
first O
dart O
. O
And O
let O
no O
man O
doubt O
this O
Arkite O
story O
; O
for O
in O
the O
ancient O
Joppa O
, O
now O
Jaffa O
, O
on O
the O
Syrian O
coast O
, O
in O
one O
of O
the O
Pagan O
temples O
, O
there O
stood O
for O
many O
ages O
the O
vast O
skeleton O
of O
a O
whale O
, O
which O
the O
city O
's O
legends O
and O
all O
the O
inhabitants O
asserted O
to O
be O
the O
identical O
bones O
of O
the O
monster O
that O
Perseus O
slew O
. O
When O
the O
Romans O
took O
Joppa O
, O
the O
same O
skeleton O
was O
carried O
to O
Italy O
in O
triumph O
. O
What O
seems O
most O
singular O
and O
suggestively O
important O
in O
this O
story O
, O
is O
this O
: O
it O
was O
from O
Joppa O
that O
Jonah O
set O
sail O
. O
Akin O
to O
the O
adventure O
of O
Perseus O
and O
Andromeda—indeed O
, O
by O
some O
supposed O
to O
be O
indirectly O
derived O
from O
it—is O
that O
famous O
story O
of O
St. O
George O
and O
the O
Dragon O
; O
which O
dragon O
I O
maintain O
to O
have O
been O
a O
whale O
; O
for O
in O
many O
old O
chronicles O
whales O
and O
dragons O
are O
strangely O
jumbled O
together O
, O
and O
often O
stand O
for O
each O
other O
. O
" O
Thou O
art O
as O
a O
lion O
of O
the O
waters O
, O
and O
as O
a O
dragon O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
" O
said O
Ezekiel O
; O
hereby O
, O
plainly O
meaning O
a O
whale O
; O
in O
truth O
, O
some O
versions O
of O
the O
Bible O
use O
that O
word O
itself O
. O
Besides O
, O
it O
would O
much O
subtract O
from O
the O
glory O
of O
the O
exploit O
had O
St. O
George O
but O
encountered O
a O
crawling O
reptile O
of O
the O
land O
, O
instead O
of O
doing O
battle O
with O
the O
great O
monster O
of O
the O
deep O
. O
Any O
man O
may O
kill O
a O
snake O
, O
but O
only O
a O
Perseus O
, O
a O
St. O
George O
, O
a O
Coffin O
, O
have O
the O
heart O
in O
them O
to O
march O
boldly O
up O
to O
a O
whale O
. O
Let O
not O
the O
modern O
paintings O
of O
this O
scene O
mislead O
us O
; O
for O
though O
the O
creature O
encountered O
by O
that O
valiant O
whaleman O
of O
old O
is O
vaguely O
represented O
of O
a O
griffin-like O
shape O
, O
and O
though O
the O
battle O
is O
depicted O
on O
land O
and O
the O
saint O
on O
horseback O
, O
yet O
considering O
the O
great O
ignorance O
of O
those O
times O
, O
when O
the O
true O
form O
of O
the O
whale O
was O
unknown O
to O
artists O
; O
and O
considering O
that O
as O
in O
Perseus O
' O
case O
, O
St. O
George O
's O
whale O
might O
have O
crawled O
up O
out O
of O
the O
sea O
on O
the O
beach O
; O
and O
considering O
that O
the O
animal O
ridden O
by O
St. O
George O
might O
have O
been O
only O
a O
large O
seal O
, O
or O
sea-horse O
; O
bearing O
all O
this O
in O
mind O
, O
it O
will O
not O
appear O
altogether O
incompatible O
with O
the O
sacred O
legend O
and O
the O
ancientest O
draughts O
of O
the O
scene O
, O
to O
hold O
this O
so-called O
dragon O
no O
other O
than O
the O
great O
Leviathan O
himself O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
placed O
before O
the O
strict O
and O
piercing O
truth O
, O
this O
whole O
story O
will O
fare O
like O
that O
fish O
, O
flesh O
, O
and O
fowl O
idol O
of O
the O
Philistines O
, O
Dagon O
by O
name O
; O
who O
being O
planted O
before O
the O
ark O
of O
Israel O
, O
his O
horse O
's O
head O
and O
both O
the O
palms O
of O
his O
hands O
fell O
off O
from O
him O
, O
and O
only O
the O
stump O
or O
fishy O
part O
of O
him O
remained O
. O
Thus O
, O
then O
, O
one O
of O
our O
own O
noble O
stamp O
, O
even O
a O
whaleman O
, O
is O
the O
tutelary O
guardian O
of O
England O
; O
and O
by O
good O
rights O
, O
we O
harpooneers O
of O
Nantucket O
should O
be O
enrolled O
in O
the O
most O
noble O
order O
of O
St. O
George O
. O
And O
therefore O
, O
let O
not O
the O
knights O
of O
that O
honorable O
company O
( O
none O
of O
whom O
, O
I O
venture O
to O
say O
, O
have O
ever O
had O
to O
do O
with O
a O
whale O
like O
their O
great O
patron O
) O
, O
let O
them O
never O
eye O
a O
Nantucketer O
with O
disdain O
, O
since O
even O
in O
our O
woollen O
frocks O
and O
tarred O
trowsers O
we O
are O
much O
better O
entitled O
to O
St. O
George O
's O
decoration O
than O
they O
. O
Whether O
to O
admit O
Hercules O
among O
us O
or O
not O
, O
concerning O
this O
I O
long O
remained O
dubious O
: O
for O
though O
according O
to O
the O
Greek O
mythologies O
, O
that O
antique O
Crockett O
and O
Kit O
Carson—that O
brawny O
doer O
of O
rejoicing O
good O
deeds O
, O
was O
swallowed O
down O
and O
thrown O
up O
by O
a O
whale O
; O
still O
, O
whether O
that O
strictly O
makes O
a O
whaleman O
of O
him O
, O
that O
might O
be O
mooted O
. O
It O
nowhere O
appears O
that O
he O
ever O
actually O
harpooned O
his O
fish O
, O
unless O
, O
indeed O
, O
from O
the O
inside O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
he O
may O
be O
deemed O
a O
sort O
of O
involuntary O
whaleman O
; O
at O
any O
rate O
the O
whale O
caught O
him O
, O
if O
he O
did O
not O
the O
whale O
. O
I O
claim O
him O
for O
one O
of O
our O
clan O
. O
But O
, O
by O
the O
best O
contradictory O
authorities O
, O
this O
Grecian O
story O
of O
Hercules O
and O
the O
whale O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
derived O
from O
the O
still O
more O
ancient O
Hebrew O
story O
of O
Jonah O
and O
the O
whale O
; O
and O
vice O
versa O
; O
certainly O
they O
are O
very O
similar O
. O
If O
I O
claim O
the O
demigod O
then O
, O
why O
not O
the O
prophet O
? O
Nor O
do O
heroes O
, O
saints O
, O
demigods O
, O
and O
prophets O
alone O
comprise O
the O
whole O
roll O
of O
our O
order O
. O
Our O
grand O
master O
is O
still O
to O
be O
named O
; O
for O
like O
royal O
kings O
of O
old O
times O
, O
we O
find O
the O
head-waters O
of O
our O
fraternity O
in O
nothing O
short O
of O
the O
great O
gods O
themselves O
. O
That O
wondrous O
oriental O
story O
is O
now O
to O
be O
rehearsed O
from O
the O
Shaster O
, O
which O
gives O
us O
the O
dread O
Vishnoo O
, O
one O
of O
the O
three O
persons O
in O
the O
godhead O
of O
the O
Hindoos O
; O
gives O
us O
this O
divine O
Vishnoo O
himself O
for O
our O
Lord O
; O
—Vishnoo O
, O
who O
, O
by O
the O
first O
of O
his O
ten O
earthly O
incarnations O
, O
has O
for O
ever O
set O
apart O
and O
sanctified O
the O
whale O
. O
When O
Brahma O
, O
or O
the O
God O
of O
Gods O
, O
saith O
the O
Shaster O
, O
resolved O
to O
recreate O
the O
world O
after O
one O
of O
its O
periodical O
dissolutions O
, O
he O
gave O
birth O
to O
Vishnoo O
, O
to O
preside O
over O
the O
work O
; O
but O
the O
Vedas O
, O
or O
mystical O
books O
, O
whose O
perusal O
would O
seem O
to O
have O
been O
indispensable O
to O
Vishnoo O
before O
beginning O
the O
creation O
, O
and O
which O
therefore O
must O
have O
contained O
something O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
practical O
hints O
to O
young O
architects O
, O
these O
Vedas O
were O
lying O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
waters O
; O
so O
Vishnoo O
became O
incarnate O
in O
a O
whale O
, O
and O
sounding O
down O
in O
him O
to O
the O
uttermost O
depths O
, O
rescued O
the O
sacred O
volumes O
. O
Was O
not O
this O
Vishnoo O
a O
whaleman O
, O
then O
? O
even O
as O
a O
man O
who O
rides O
a O
horse O
is O
called O
a O
horseman O
? O
Perseus O
, O
St. O
George O
, O
Hercules O
, O
Jonah O
, O
and O
Vishnoo O
! O
there O
's O
a O
member-roll O
for O
you O
! O
What O
club O
but O
the O
whaleman O
's O
can O
head O
off O
like O
that O
? O
