Seat O
thyself O
sultanically O
among O
the O
moons O
of O
Saturn O
, O
and O
take O
high O
abstracted O
man O
alone O
; O
and O
he O
seems O
a O
wonder O
, O
a O
grandeur O
, O
and O
a O
woe O
. O
But O
from O
the O
same O
point O
, O
take O
mankind O
in O
mass O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
they O
seem O
a O
mob O
of O
unnecessary O
duplicates O
, O
both O
contemporary O
and O
hereditary O
. O
But O
most O
humble O
though O
he O
was O
, O
and O
far O
from O
furnishing O
an O
example O
of O
the O
high O
, O
humane O
abstraction O
; O
the O
Pequod O
's O
carpenter O
was O
no O
duplicate O
; O
hence O
, O
he O
now O
comes O
in O
person O
on O
this O
stage O
. O
Like O
all O
sea-going O
ship O
carpenters O
, O
and O
more O
especially O
those O
belonging O
to O
whaling O
vessels O
, O
he O
was O
, O
to O
a O
certain O
off-hand O
, O
practical O
extent O
, O
alike O
experienced O
in O
numerous O
trades O
and O
callings O
collateral O
to O
his O
own O
; O
the O
carpenter O
's O
pursuit O
being O
the O
ancient O
and O
outbranching O
trunk O
of O
all O
those O
numerous O
handicrafts O
which O
more O
or O
less O
have O
to O
do O
with O
wood O
as O
an O
auxiliary O
material O
. O
But O
, O
besides O
the O
application O
to O
him O
of O
the O
generic O
remark O
above O
, O
this O
carpenter O
of O
the O
Pequod O
was O
singularly O
efficient O
in O
those O
thousand O
nameless O
mechanical O
emergencies O
continually O
recurring O
in O
a O
large O
ship O
, O
upon O
a O
three O
or O
four O
years O
' O
voyage O
, O
in O
uncivilized O
and O
far-distant O
seas O
. O
For O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
his O
readiness O
in O
ordinary O
duties O
: O
— O
repairing O
stove O
boats O
, O
sprung O
spars O
, O
reforming O
the O
shape O
of O
clumsy-bladed O
oars O
, O
inserting O
bull O
's O
eyes O
in O
the O
deck O
, O
or O
new O
tree-nails O
in O
the O
side O
planks O
, O
and O
other O
miscellaneous O
matters O
more O
directly O
pertaining O
to O
his O
special O
business O
; O
he O
was O
moreover O
unhesitatingly O
expert O
in O
all O
manner O
of O
conflicting O
aptitudes O
, O
both O
useful O
and O
capricious O
. O
The O
one O
grand O
stage O
where O
he O
enacted O
all O
his O
various O
parts O
so O
manifold O
, O
was O
his O
vice-bench O
; O
a O
long O
rude O
ponderous O
table O
furnished O
with O
several O
vices O
, O
of O
different O
sizes O
, O
and O
both O
of O
iron O
and O
of O
wood O
. O
At O
all O
times O
except O
when O
whales O
were O
alongside O
, O
this O
bench O
was O
securely O
lashed O
athwartships O
against O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
Try-works O
. O
A O
belaying O
pin O
is O
found O
too O
large O
to O
be O
easily O
inserted O
into O
its O
hole O
: O
the O
carpenter O
claps O
it O
into O
one O
of O
his O
ever O
ready O
vices O
, O
and O
straightway O
files O
it O
smaller O
. O
A O
lost O
landbird O
of O
strange O
plumage O
strays O
on O
board O
, O
and O
is O
made O
a O
captive O
: O
out O
of O
clean O
shaved O
rods O
of O
right-whale O
bone O
, O
and O
cross-beams O
of O
sperm O
whale O
ivory O
, O
the O
carpenter O
makes O
a O
pagoda-looking O
cage O
for O
it O
. O
An O
oarsman O
sprains O
his O
wrist O
: O
the O
carpenter O
concocts O
a O
soothing O
lotion O
. O
Stubb O
longed O
for O
vermillion O
stars O
to O
be O
painted O
upon O
the O
blade O
of O
his O
every O
oar O
; O
screwing O
each O
oar O
in O
his O
big O
vice O
of O
wood O
, O
the O
carpenter O
symmetrically O
supplies O
the O
constellation O
. O
A O
sailor O
takes O
a O
fancy O
to O
wear O
shark-bone O
ear-rings O
: O
the O
carpenter O
drills O
his O
ears O
. O
Another O
has O
the O
toothache O
: O
the O
carpenter O
out O
pincers O
, O
and O
clapping O
one O
hand O
upon O
his O
bench O
bids O
him O
be O
seated O
there O
; O
but O
the O
poor O
fellow O
unmanageably O
winces O
under O
the O
unconcluded O
operation O
; O
whirling O
round O
the O
handle O
of O
his O
wooden O
vice O
, O
the O
carpenter O
signs O
him O
to O
clap O
his O
jaw O
in O
that O
, O
if O
he O
would O
have O
him O
draw O
the O
tooth O
. O
Thus O
, O
this O
carpenter O
was O
prepared O
at O
all O
points O
, O
and O
alike O
indifferent O
and O
without O
respect O
in O
all O
. O
Teeth O
he O
accounted O
bits O
of O
ivory O
; O
heads O
he O
deemed O
but O
top-blocks O
; O
men O
themselves O
he O
lightly O
held O
for O
capstans O
. O
But O
while O
now O
upon O
so O
wide O
a O
field O
thus O
variously O
accomplished O
and O
with O
such O
liveliness O
of O
expertness O
in O
him O
, O
too O
; O
all O
this O
would O
seem O
to O
argue O
some O
uncommon O
vivacity O
of O
intelligence O
. O
But O
not O
precisely O
so O
. O
For O
nothing O
was O
this O
man O
more O
remarkable O
, O
than O
for O
a O
certain O
impersonal O
stolidity O
as O
it O
were O
; O
impersonal O
, O
I O
say O
; O
for O
it O
so O
shaded O
off O
into O
the O
surrounding O
infinite O
of O
things O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
one O
with O
the O
general O
stolidity O
discernible O
in O
the O
whole O
visible O
world O
; O
which O
while O
pauselessly O
active O
in O
uncounted O
modes O
, O
still O
eternally O
holds O
its O
peace O
, O
and O
ignores O
you O
, O
though O
you O
dig O
foundations O
for O
cathedrals O
. O
Yet O
was O
this O
half-horrible O
stolidity O
in O
him O
, O
involving O
, O
too O
, O
as O
it O
appeared O
, O
an O
all-ramifying O
heartlessness O
; O
— O
yet O
was O
it O
oddly O
dashed O
at O
times O
, O
with O
an O
old O
, O
crutch-like O
, O
antediluvian O
, O
wheezing O
humorousness O
, O
not O
unstreaked O
now O
and O
then O
with O
a O
certain O
grizzled O
wittiness O
; O
such O
as O
might O
have O
served O
to O
pass O
the O
time O
during O
the O
midnight O
watch O
on O
the O
bearded O
forecastle O
of O
Noah O
's O
ark O
. O
Was O
it O
that O
this O
old O
carpenter O
had O
been O
a O
life-long O
wanderer O
, O
whose O
much O
rolling O
, O
to O
and O
fro O
, O
not O
only O
had O
gathered O
no O
moss O
; O
but O
what O
is O
more O
, O
had O
rubbed O
off O
whatever O
small O
outward O
clingings O
might O
have O
originally O
pertained O
to O
him O
? O
He O
was O
a O
stript O
abstract O
; O
an O
unfractioned O
integral O
; O
uncompromised O
as O
a O
new-born O
babe O
; O
living O
without O
premeditated O
reference O
to O
this O
world O
or O
the O
next O
. O
You O
might O
almost O
say O
, O
that O
this O
strange O
uncompromisedness O
in O
him O
involved O
a O
sort O
of O
unintelligence O
; O
for O
in O
his O
numerous O
trades O
, O
he O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
work O
so O
much O
by O
reason O
or O
by O
instinct O
, O
or O
simply O
because O
he O
had O
been O
tutored O
to O
it O
, O
or O
by O
any O
intermixture O
of O
all O
these O
, O
even O
or O
uneven O
; O
but O
merely O
by O
a O
kind O
of O
deaf O
and O
dumb O
, O
spontaneous O
literal O
process O
. O
He O
was O
a O
pure O
manipulator O
; O
his O
brain O
, O
if O
he O
had O
ever O
had O
one O
, O
must O
have O
early O
oozed O
along O
into O
the O
muscles O
of O
his O
fingers O
. O
He O
was O
like O
one O
of O
those O
unreasoning O
but O
still O
highly O
useful O
, O
multum O
in O
parvo O
, O
Sheffield O
contrivances O
, O
assuming O
the O
exterior— O
though O
a O
little O
swelled—of O
a O
common O
pocket O
knife O
; O
but O
containing O
, O
not O
only O
blades O
of O
various O
sizes O
, O
but O
also O
screw-drivers O
, O
cork-screws O
, O
tweezers O
, O
awls O
, O
pens O
, O
rulers O
, O
nail-filers O
, O
countersinkers O
. O
So O
, O
if O
his O
superiors O
wanted O
to O
use O
the O
carpenter O
for O
a O
screw-driver O
, O
all O
they O
had O
to O
do O
was O
to O
open O
that O
part O
of O
him O
, O
and O
the O
screw O
was O
fast O
: O
or O
if O
for O
tweezers O
, O
take O
him O
up O
by O
the O
legs O
, O
and O
there O
they O
were O
. O
Yet O
, O
as O
previously O
hinted O
, O
this O
omnitooled O
, O
open-and-shut O
carpenter O
, O
was O
, O
after O
all O
, O
no O
mere O
machine O
of O
an O
automaton O
. O
If O
he O
did O
not O
have O
a O
common O
soul O
in O
him O
, O
he O
had O
a O
subtle O
something O
that O
somehow O
anomalously O
did O
its O
duty O
. O
What O
that O
was O
, O
whether O
essence O
of O
quicksilver O
, O
or O
a O
few O
drops O
of O
hartshorn O
, O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
. O
But O
there O
it O
was O
; O
and O
there O
it O
had O
abided O
for O
now O
some O
sixty O
years O
or O
more O
. O
And O
this O
it O
was O
, O
this O
same O
unaccountable O
, O
cunning O
life-principle O
in O
him O
; O
this O
it O
was O
, O
that O
kept O
him O
a O
great O
part O
of O
the O
time O
soliloquizing O
; O
but O
only O
like O
an O
unreasoning O
wheel O
, O
which O
also O
hummingly O
soliloquizes O
; O
or O
rather O
, O
his O
body O
was O
a O
sentry-box O
and O
this O
soliloquizer O
on O
guard O
there O
, O
and O
talking O
all O
the O
time O
to O
keep O
himself O
awake O
. O
