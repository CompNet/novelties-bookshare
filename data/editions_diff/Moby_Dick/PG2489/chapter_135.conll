The O
morning O
of O
the O
third O
day O
dawned O
fair O
and O
fresh O
, O
and O
once O
more O
the O
solitary O
night-man O
at O
the O
fore-mast-head O
was O
relieved O
by O
crowds O
of O
the O
daylight O
look-outs O
, O
who O
dotted O
every O
mast O
and O
almost O
every O
spar O
. O
" O
D O
'ye O
see O
him O
? O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
; O
but O
the O
whale O
was O
not O
yet O
in O
sight O
. O
" O
In O
his O
infallible O
wake O
, O
though O
; O
but O
follow O
that O
wake O
, O
that O
's O
all O
. O
Helm O
there O
; O
steady O
, O
as O
thou O
goest O
, O
and O
hast O
been O
going O
. O
What O
a O
lovely O
day O
again O
! O
were O
it O
a O
new-made O
world O
, O
and O
made O
for O
a O
summer-house O
to O
the O
angels O
, O
and O
this O
morning O
the O
first O
of O
its O
throwing O
open O
to O
them O
, O
a O
fairer O
day O
could O
not O
dawn O
upon O
that O
world O
. O
Here O
's O
food O
for O
thought O
, O
had O
Ahab O
time O
to O
think O
; O
but O
Ahab O
never O
thinks O
; O
he O
only O
feels O
, O
feels O
, O
feels O
; O
that O
's O
tingling O
enough O
for O
mortal O
man O
! O
to O
think O
's O
audacity O
. O
God O
only O
has O
that O
right O
and O
privilege O
. O
Thinking O
is O
, O
or O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
a O
coolness O
and O
a O
calmness O
; O
and O
our O
poor O
hearts O
throb O
, O
and O
our O
poor O
brains O
beat O
too O
much O
for O
that O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
I O
've O
sometimes O
thought O
my O
brain O
was O
very O
calm— O
frozen O
calm O
, O
this O
old O
skull O
cracks O
so O
, O
like O
a O
glass O
in O
which O
the O
contents O
turned O
to O
ice O
, O
and O
shiver O
it O
. O
And O
still O
this O
hair O
is O
growing O
now O
; O
this O
moment O
growing O
, O
and O
heat O
must O
breed O
it O
; O
but O
no O
, O
it O
's O
like O
that O
sort O
of O
common O
grass O
that O
will O
grow O
anywhere O
, O
between O
the O
earthy O
clefts O
of O
Greenland O
ice O
or O
in O
Vesuvius O
lava O
. O
How O
the O
wild O
winds O
blow O
it O
; O
they O
whip O
it O
about O
me O
as O
the O
torn O
shreds O
of O
split O
sails O
lash O
the O
tossed O
ship O
they O
cling O
to O
. O
A O
vile O
wind O
that O
has O
no O
doubt O
blown O
ere O
this O
through O
prison O
corridors O
and O
cells O
, O
and O
wards O
of O
hospitals O
, O
and O
ventilated O
them O
, O
and O
now O
comes O
blowing O
hither O
as O
innocent O
as O
fleeces O
. O
Out O
upon O
it O
! O
—it O
's O
tainted O
. O
Were O
I O
the O
wind O
, O
I O
'd O
blow O
no O
more O
on O
such O
a O
wicked O
, O
miserable O
world O
. O
I O
'd O
crawl O
somewhere O
to O
a O
cave O
, O
and O
slink O
there O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
't O
is O
a O
noble O
and O
heroic O
thing O
, O
the O
wind O
! O
who O
ever O
conquered O
it O
? O
In O
every O
fight O
it O
has O
the O
last O
and O
bitterest O
blow O
. O
Run O
tilting O
at O
it O
, O
and O
you O
but O
run O
through O
it O
. O
Ha O
! O
a O
coward O
wind O
that O
strikes O
stark O
naked O
men O
, O
but O
will O
not O
stand O
to O
receive O
a O
single O
blow O
. O
Even O
Ahab O
is O
a O
braver O
thing—a O
nobler O
thing O
than O
that O
. O
Would O
now O
the O
wind O
but O
had O
a O
body O
; O
but O
all O
the O
things O
that O
most O
exasperate O
and O
outrage O
mortal O
man O
, O
all O
these O
things O
are O
bodiless O
, O
but O
only O
bodiless O
as O
objects O
, O
not O
as O
agents O
. O
There O
's O
a O
most O
special O
, O
a O
most O
cunning O
, O
oh O
, O
a O
most O
malicious O
difference O
! O
And O
yet O
, O
I O
say O
again O
, O
and O
swear O
it O
now O
, O
that O
there O
's O
something O
all O
glorious O
and O
gracious O
in O
the O
wind O
. O
These O
warm O
Trade O
Winds O
, O
at O
least O
, O
that O
in O
the O
clear O
heavens O
blow O
straight O
on O
, O
in O
strong O
and O
steadfast O
, O
vigorous O
mildness O
; O
and O
veer O
not O
from O
their O
mark O
, O
however O
the O
baser O
currents O
of O
the O
sea O
may O
turn O
and O
tack O
, O
and O
mightiest O
Mississippies O
of O
the O
land O
swift O
and O
swerve O
about O
, O
uncertain O
where O
to O
go O
at O
last O
. O
And O
by O
the O
eternal O
Poles O
! O
these O
same O
Trades O
that O
so O
directly O
blow O
my O
good O
ship O
on O
; O
these O
Trades O
, O
or O
something O
like O
them—something O
so O
unchangeable O
, O
and O
full O
as O
strong O
, O
blow O
my O
keeled O
soul O
along O
! O
To O
it O
! O
Aloft O
there O
! O
What O
d O
'ye O
see O
? O
" O
" O
Nothing O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Nothing O
! O
and O
noon O
at O
hand O
! O
The O
doubloon O
goes O
a-begging O
! O
See O
the O
sun O
! O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
it O
must O
be O
so O
. O
I O
've O
over-sailed O
him O
. O
How O
, O
got O
the O
start O
? O
Aye O
, O
he O
's O
chasing O
me O
now O
; O
not O
I O
, O
him— O
that O
's O
bad O
; O
I O
might O
have O
known O
it O
, O
too O
. O
Fool O
! O
the O
lines— O
the O
harpoons O
he O
's O
towing O
. O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
I O
have O
run O
him O
by O
last O
night O
. O
About O
! O
about O
! O
Come O
down O
, O
all O
of O
ye O
, O
but O
the O
regular O
look O
outs O
! O
Man O
the O
braces O
! O
" O
Steering O
as O
she O
had O
done O
, O
the O
wind O
had O
been O
somewhat O
on O
the O
Pequod O
's O
quarter O
, O
so O
that O
now O
being O
pointed O
in O
the O
reverse O
direction O
, O
the O
braced O
ship O
sailed O
hard O
upon O
the O
breeze O
as O
she O
rechurned O
the O
cream O
in O
her O
own O
white O
wake O
. O
" O
Against O
the O
wind O
he O
now O
steers O
for O
the O
open O
jaw O
, O
" O
murmured O
Starbuck O
to O
himself O
, O
as O
he O
coiled O
the O
new-hauled O
main-brace O
upon O
the O
rail O
. O
" O
God O
keep O
us O
, O
but O
already O
my O
bones O
feel O
damp O
within O
me O
, O
and O
from O
the O
inside O
wet O
my O
flesh O
. O
I O
misdoubt O
me O
that O
I O
disobey O
my O
God O
in O
obeying O
him O
! O
" O
" O
Stand O
by O
to O
sway O
me O
up O
! O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
advancing O
to O
the O
hempen O
basket O
. O
" O
We O
should O
meet O
him O
soon O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
and O
straightway O
Starbuck O
did O
Ahab O
's O
bidding O
, O
and O
once O
more O
Ahab O
swung O
on O
high O
. O
A O
whole O
hour O
now O
passed O
; O
gold-beaten O
out O
to O
ages O
. O
Time O
itself O
now O
held O
long O
breaths O
with O
keen O
suspense O
. O
But O
at O
last O
, O
some O
three O
points O
off O
the O
weather O
bow O
, O
Ahab O
descried O
the O
spout O
again O
, O
and O
instantly O
from O
the O
three O
mast-heads O
three O
shrieks O
went O
up O
as O
if O
the O
tongues O
of O
fire O
had O
voiced O
it O
. O
" O
Forehead O
to O
forehead O
I O
meet O
thee O
, O
this O
third O
time O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
! O
On O
deck O
there O
! O
—brace O
sharper O
up O
; O
crowd O
her O
into O
the O
wind O
's O
eye O
. O
He O
's O
too O
far O
off O
to O
lower O
yet O
, O
Mr. O
Starbuck O
. O
The O
sails O
shake O
! O
Stand O
over O
that O
helmsman O
with O
a O
top-maul O
! O
So O
, O
so O
; O
he O
travels O
fast O
, O
and O
I O
must O
down O
. O
But O
let O
me O
have O
one O
more O
good O
round O
look O
aloft O
here O
at O
the O
sea O
; O
there O
's O
time O
for O
that O
. O
An O
old O
, O
old O
sight O
, O
and O
yet O
somehow O
so O
young O
; O
aye O
, O
and O
not O
changed O
a O
wink O
since O
I O
first O
saw O
it O
, O
a O
boy O
, O
from O
the O
sand-hills O
of O
Nantucket O
! O
The O
same—the O
same O
! O
— O
the O
same O
to O
Noah O
as O
to O
me O
. O
There O
's O
a O
soft O
shower O
to O
leeward O
. O
Such O
lovely O
leewardings O
! O
They O
must O
lead O
somewhere— O
to O
something O
else O
than O
common O
land O
, O
more O
palmy O
than O
the O
palms O
. O
Leeward O
! O
the O
white O
whale O
goes O
that O
way O
; O
look O
to O
windward O
, O
then O
; O
the O
better O
if O
the O
bitterer O
quarter O
. O
But O
good O
bye O
, O
good O
bye O
, O
old O
mast-head O
! O
What O
's O
this O
? O
—green O
? O
aye O
, O
tiny O
mosses O
in O
these O
warped O
cracks O
. O
No O
such O
green O
weather O
stains O
on O
Ahab O
's O
head O
! O
There O
's O
the O
difference O
now O
between O
man O
's O
old O
age O
and O
matter O
's O
. O
But O
aye O
, O
old O
mast O
, O
we O
both O
grow O
old O
together O
; O
sound O
in O
our O
hulls O
, O
though O
are O
we O
not O
, O
my O
ship O
? O
Aye O
, O
minus O
a O
leg O
, O
that O
's O
all O
. O
By O
heaven O
this O
dead O
wood O
has O
the O
better O
of O
my O
live O
flesh O
every O
way O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
compare O
with O
it O
; O
and O
I O
've O
known O
some O
ships O
made O
of O
dead O
trees O
outlast O
the O
lives O
of O
men O
made O
of O
the O
most O
vital O
stuff O
of O
vital O
fathers O
. O
What O
's O
that O
he O
said O
? O
he O
should O
still O
go O
before O
me O
, O
my O
pilot O
; O
and O
yet O
to O
be O
seen O
again O
? O
But O
where O
? O
Will O
I O
have O
eyes O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
supposing O
I O
descend O
those O
endless O
stairs O
? O
and O
all O
night O
I O
've O
been O
sailing O
from O
him O
, O
wherever O
he O
did O
sink O
to O
. O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
like O
many O
more O
thou O
told'st O
direful O
truth O
as O
touching O
thyself O
, O
O O
Parsee O
; O
but O
, O
Ahab O
, O
there O
thy O
shot O
fell O
short O
. O
Good O
bye O
, O
mast-head—keep O
a O
good O
eye O
upon O
the O
whale O
, O
the O
while O
I O
'm O
gone O
. O
We O
'll O
talk O
to-morrow O
, O
nay O
, O
to-night O
, O
when O
the O
white O
whale O
lies O
down O
there O
, O
tied O
by O
head O
and O
tail O
. O
" O
He O
gave O
the O
word O
; O
and O
still O
gazing O
round O
him O
, O
was O
steadily O
lowered O
through O
the O
cloven O
blue O
air O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
In O
due O
time O
the O
boats O
were O
lowered O
; O
but O
as O
standing O
in O
his O
shallop O
's O
stern O
, O
Ahab O
just O
hovered O
upon O
the O
point O
of O
the O
descent O
, O
he O
waved O
to O
the O
mate O
, O
—who O
held O
one O
of O
the O
tackle—ropes O
on O
deck— O
and O
bade O
him O
pause O
. O
" O
Starbuck O
! O
" O
" O
Sir O
? O
" O
" O
For O
the O
third O
time O
my O
soul O
's O
ship O
starts O
upon O
this O
voyage O
, O
Starbuck O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
sir O
, O
thou O
wilt O
have O
it O
so O
. O
" O
" O
Some O
ships O
sail O
from O
their O
ports O
, O
and O
ever O
afterwards O
are O
missing O
, O
Starbuck O
! O
" O
" O
Truth O
, O
sir O
: O
saddest O
truth O
. O
" O
" O
Some O
men O
die O
at O
ebb O
tide O
; O
some O
at O
low O
water O
; O
some O
at O
the O
full O
of O
the O
flood O
; O
—and O
I O
feel O
now O
like O
a O
billow O
that O
's O
all O
one O
crested O
comb O
, O
Starbuck O
. O
I O
am O
old O
; O
—shake O
hands O
with O
me O
, O
man O
. O
" O
Their O
hands O
met O
; O
their O
eyes O
fastened O
; O
Starbuck O
's O
tears O
the O
glue O
. O
" O
Oh O
, O
my O
captain O
, O
my O
captain O
! O
—noble O
heart—go O
not—go O
not O
! O
—see O
, O
it O
's O
a O
brave O
man O
that O
weeps O
; O
how O
great O
the O
agony O
of O
the O
persuasion O
then O
! O
" O
" O
Lower O
away O
! O
" O
-cried O
Ahab O
, O
tossing O
the O
mate O
's O
arm O
from O
him O
. O
" O
Stand O
by O
for O
the O
crew O
! O
" O
In O
an O
instant O
the O
boat O
was O
pulling O
round O
close O
under O
the O
stern O
. O
" O
The O
sharks O
! O
the O
sharks O
! O
" O
cried O
a O
voice O
from O
the O
low O
cabin-window O
there O
; O
" O
O O
master O
, O
my O
master O
, O
come O
back O
! O
" O
But O
Ahab O
heard O
nothing O
; O
for O
his O
own O
voice O
was O
high-lifted O
then O
; O
and O
the O
boat O
leaped O
on O
. O
Yet O
the O
voice O
spake O
true O
; O
for O
scarce O
had O
he O
pushed O
from O
the O
ship O
, O
when O
numbers O
of O
sharks O
, O
seemingly O
rising O
from O
out O
the O
dark O
waters O
beneath O
the O
hull O
, O
maliciously O
snapped O
at O
the O
blades O
of O
the O
oars O
, O
every O
time O
they O
dipped O
in O
the O
water O
; O
and O
in O
this O
way O
accompanied O
the O
boat O
with O
their O
bites O
. O
It O
is O
a O
thing O
not O
uncommonly O
happening O
to O
the O
whale-boats O
in O
those O
swarming O
seas O
; O
the O
sharks O
at O
times O
apparently O
following O
them O
in O
the O
same O
prescient O
way O
that O
vultures O
hover O
over O
the O
banners O
of O
marching O
regiments O
in O
the O
east O
. O
But O
these O
were O
the O
first O
sharks O
that O
had O
been O
observed O
by O
the O
Pequod O
since O
the O
White O
Whale O
had O
been O
first O
descried O
; O
and O
whether O
it O
was O
that O
Ahab O
's O
crew O
were O
all O
such O
tiger-yellow O
barbarians O
, O
and O
therefore O
their O
flesh O
more O
musky O
to O
the O
senses O
of O
the O
sharks— O
a O
matter O
sometimes O
well O
known O
to O
affect O
them O
, O
—however O
it O
was O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
follow O
that O
one O
boat O
without O
molesting O
the O
others O
. O
" O
Heart O
of O
wrought O
steel O
! O
" O
murmured O
Starbuck O
gazing O
over O
the O
side O
, O
and O
following O
with O
his O
eyes O
the O
receding O
boat— O
" O
canst O
thou O
yet O
ring O
boldly O
to O
that O
sight O
? O
—lowering O
thy O
keel O
among O
ravening O
sharks O
, O
and O
followed O
by O
them O
, O
open-mouthed O
to O
the O
chase O
; O
and O
this O
the O
critical O
third O
day O
? O
—For O
when O
three O
days O
flow O
together O

sure O
the O

the O
morning O

the O
second O
the O
noon O

and O
the O
third O
the O
evening O

the O
end O
of O
that O

that O

what O
it O

Oh O
! O
my O
God O
! O
what O
is O
this O
that O
shoots O
through O
me O
, O
and O
leaves O
me O
so O
deadly O
calm O
, O
yet O
expectant O
, O
—fixed O
at O
the O
top O
of O
a O
shudder O
! O
Future O
things O
swim O
before O
me O
, O
as O
in O
empty O
outlines O
and O
skeletons O
; O
all O
the O
past O
is O
somehow O
grown O
dim O

Mary O

girl O
; O
thou O
fadest O
in O
pale O
glories O
behind O
me O
; O
boy O
! O
I O
seem O
to O
see O
but O
thy O
eyes O
grown O
wondrous O
blue O
. O
Strangest O
problems O
of O
life O
seem O
clearing O
; O
but O
clouds O
sweep O
between—Is O
my O
journey O
's O
end O
coming O
? O
My O
legs O
feel O
faint O
; O
like O
his O
who O
has O
footed O
it O
all O
day O

Feel O
thy O
heart O
, O
—beats O
it O
yet O
? O
Stir O
thyself O

Starbuck O

— O
stave O
it O
off—move O

aloud O

—Mast-head O
there O

ye O
my O
boy O

hand O
on O
the O
hill O

—Crazed O

aloft O

keep O
thy O
keenest O
eye O
upon O
the O
boats O

well O
the O

— O
Ho O
! O
again O
! O
—drive O
off O
that O
hawk O
! O

! O
he O
pecks—he O
tears O
the O
vane O
" O
— O
pointing O
to O
the O
red O
flag O
flying O
at O
the O
main-truck— O
" O
Ha O
, O
he O
soars O
away O
with O
it O
! O
—Where O
's O
the O
old O
man O
now O
? O
see'st O
thou O
that O
sight O
, O
oh O
Ahab O
! O
—shudder O
, O
shudder O
! O
" O
The O
boats O
had O
not O
gone O
very O
far O
, O
when O
by O
a O
signal O
from O
the O
mast-heads— O
a O
downward O
pointed O
arm O
, O
Ahab O
knew O
that O
the O
whale O
had O
sounded O
; O
but O
intending O
to O
be O
near O
him O
at O
the O
next O
rising O
, O
he O
held O
on O
his O
way O
a O
little O
sideways O
from O
the O
vessel O
; O
the O
becharmed O
crew O
maintaining O
the O
profoundest O
silence O
, O
as O
the O
head-bent O
waves O
hammered O
and O
hammered O
against O
the O
opposing O
bow O
. O
" O
Drive O
, O
drive O
in O
your O
nails O
, O
oh O
ye O
waves O
! O
to O
their O
uttermost O
heads O
drive O
them O
in O
! O
ye O
but O
strike O
a O
thing O
without O
a O
lid O
; O
and O
no O
coffin O
and O
no O
hearse O
can O
be O
mine O
: O
—and O
hemp O
only O
can O
kill O
me O
! O
Ha O
! O
ha O
! O
" O
Suddenly O
the O
waters O
around O
them O
slowly O
swelled O
in O
broad O
circles O
; O
then O
quickly O
upheaved O
, O
as O
if O
sideways O
sliding O
from O
a O
submerged O
berg O
of O
ice O
, O
swiftly O
rising O
to O
the O
surface O
. O
A O
low O
rumbling O
sound O
was O
heard O
; O
a O
subterraneous O
hum O
; O
and O
then O
all O
held O
their O
breaths O
; O
as O
bedraggled O
with O
trailing O
ropes O
, O
and O
harpoons O
, O
and O
lances O
, O
a O
vast O
form O
shot O
lengthwise O
, O
but O
obliquely O
from O
the O
sea O
. O
Shrouded O
in O
a O
thin O
drooping O
veil O
of O
mist O
, O
it O
hovered O
for O
a O
moment O
in O
the O
rainbowed O
air O
; O
and O
then O
fell O
swamping O
back O
into O
the O
deep O
. O
Crushed O
thirty O
feet O
upwards O
, O
the O
waters O
flashed O
for O
an O
instant O
like O
heaps O
of O
fountains O
, O
then O
brokenly O
sank O
in O
a O
shower O
of O
flakes O
, O
leaving O
the O
circling O
surface O
creamed O
like O
new O
milk O
round O
the O
marble O
trunk O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
" O
Give O
way O
! O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
to O
the O
oarsmen O
, O
and O
the O
boats O
darted O
forward O
to O
the O
attack O
; O
but O
maddened O
by O
yesterday O
's O
fresh O
irons O
that O
corroded O
in O
him O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
seemed O
combinedly O
possessed O
by O
all O
the O
angels O
that O
fell O
from O
heaven O
. O
The O
wide O
tiers O
of O
welded O
tendons O
overspreading O
his O
broad O
white O
forehead O
, O
beneath O
the O
transparent O
skin O
, O
looked O
knitted O
together O
; O
as O
head O
on O
, O
he O
came O
churning O
his O
tail O
among O
the O
boats O
; O
and O
once O
more O
flailed O
them O
apart O
; O
spilling O
out O
the O
irons O
and O
lances O
from O
the O
two O
mates O
' O
boats O
, O
and O
dashing O
in O
one O
side O
of O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
their O
bows O
, O
but O
leaving O
Ahab O
's O
almost O
without O
a O
scar O
. O
While O
Daggoo O
and O
Queequeg O
were O
stopping O
the O
strained O
planks O
; O
and O
as O
the O
whale O
swimming O
out O
from O
them O
, O
turned O
, O
and O
showed O
one O
entire O
flank O
as O
he O
shot O
by O
them O
again O
; O
at O
that O
moment O
a O
quick O
cry O
went O
up O
. O
Lashed O
round O
and O
round O
to O
the O
fish O
's O
back O
; O
pinioned O
in O
the O
turns O
upon O
turns O
in O
which O
, O
during O
the O
past O
night O
, O
the O
whale O
had O
reeled O
the O
involutions O
of O
the O
lines O
around O
him O
, O
the O
half O
torn O
body O
of O
the O
Parsee O
was O
seen O
; O
his O
sable O
raiment O
frayed O
to O
shreds O
; O
his O
distended O
eyes O
turned O
full O
upon O
old O
Ahab O
. O
The O
harpoon O
dropped O
from O
his O
hand O
. O
" O
Befooled O
, O
befooled O
! O
" O
—drawing O
in O
a O
long O
lean O
breath— O
" O
Aye O
, O
Parsee O
! O
I O
see O
thee O
again.—Aye O
, O
and O
thou O
goest O
before O
; O
and O
this O
, O
this O
then O
is O
the O
hearse O
that O
thou O
didst O
promise O
. O
But O
I O
hold O
thee O
to O
the O
last O
letter O
of O
thy O
word O
. O
Where O
is O
the O
second O
hearse O
? O
Away O
, O
mates O
, O
to O
the O
ship O
! O
those O
boats O
are O
useless O
now O
; O
repair O
them O
if O
ye O
can O
in O
time O
, O
and O
return O
to O
me O
; O
if O
not O
, O
Ahab O
is O
enough O
to O
die—Down O
, O
men O
! O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
but O
offers O
to O
jump O
from O
this O
boat O
I O
stand O
in O
, O
that O
thing O

harpoon O

Ye O
are O
not O
other O
men O
, O
but O
my O
arms O

my O
legs O
; O
and O
so O
obey O
me.— O
Where O
's O
the O
whale O
? O
gone O
down O
again O
? O
" O
But O
he O
looked O
too O
nigh O
the O
boat O
; O
for O
as O
if O
bent O
upon O
escaping O
with O
the O
corpse O
he O
bore O
, O
and O
as O
if O
the O
particular O
place O
of O
the O
last O
encounter O
had O
been O
but O
a O
stage O
in O
his O
leeward O
voyage O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
was O
now O
again O
steadily O
swimming O
forward O
; O
and O
had O
almost O
passed O
the O
ship O
, O
—which O
thus O
far O
had O
been O
sailing O
in O
the O
contrary O
direction O
to O
him O
, O
though O
for O
the O
present O
her O
headway O
had O
been O
stopped O
. O
He O
seemed O
swimming O
with O
his O
utmost O
velocity O
, O
and O
now O
only O
intent O
upon O
pursuing O
his O
own O
straight O
path O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
Ahab O
, O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
, O
" O
not O
too O
late O
is O
it O
, O
even O
now O
, O
the O
third O
day O
, O
to O
desist O
. O
See O
! O
Moby O
Dick O
seeks O
thee O
not O
. O
It O
is O
thou O
, O
thou O
, O
that O
madly O
seekest O
him O
! O
" O
Setting O
sail O
to O
the O
rising O
wind O
, O
the O
lonely O
boat O
was O
swiftly O
impelled O
to O
leeward O
, O
by O
both O
oars O
and O
canvas O
. O
And O
at O
last O
when O
Ahab O
was O
sliding O
by O
the O
vessel O
, O
so O
near O
as O
plainly O
to O
distinguish O
Starbuck O
's O
face O
as O
he O
leaned O
over O
the O
rail O
, O
he O
hailed O
him O
to O
turn O
the O
vessel O
about O
, O
and O
follow O
him O
, O
not O
too O
swiftly O
, O
at O
a O
judicious O
interval O
. O
Glancing O
upwards O
he O
saw O
Tashtego O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
Daggoo O
, O
eagerly O
mounting O
to O
the O
three O
mast-heads O
; O
while O
the O
oarsmen O
were O
rocking O
in O
the O
two O
staved O
boats O
which O
had O
but O
just O
been O
hoisted O
to O
the O
side O
, O
and O
were O
busily O
at O
work O
in O
repairing O
them O
. O
One O
after O
the O
other O
, O
through O
the O
port-holes O
, O
as O
he O
sped O
, O
he O
also O
caught O
flying O
glimpses O
of O
Stubb O
and O
Flask O
, O
busying O
themselves O
on O
deck O
among O
bundles O
of O
new O
irons O
and O
lances O
. O
As O
he O
saw O
all O
this O
; O
as O
he O
heard O
the O
hammers O
in O
the O
broken O
boats O
; O
far O
other O
hammers O
seemed O
driving O
a O
nail O
into O
his O
heart O
. O
But O
he O
rallied O
. O
And O
now O
marking O
that O
the O
vane O
or O
flag O
was O
gone O
from O
the O
main-mast-head O
, O
he O
shouted O
to O
Tashtego O
, O
who O
had O
just O
gained O
that O
perch O
, O
to O
descend O
again O
for O
another O
flag O
, O
and O
a O
hammer O
and O
nails O
, O
and O
so O
nail O
it O
to O
the O
mast O
. O
Whether O
fagged O
by O
the O
three O
days O
' O
running O
chase O
, O
and O
the O
resistance O
to O
his O
swimming O
in O
the O
knotted O
hamper O
he O
bore O
; O
or O
whether O
it O
was O
some O
latent O
deceitfulness O
and O
malice O
in O
him O
: O
whichever O
was O
true O
, O
the O
White O
Whale O
's O
way O
now O
began O
to O
abate O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
from O
the O
boat O
so O
rapidly O
nearing O
him O
once O
more O
; O
though O
indeed O
the O
whale O
's O
last O
start O
had O
not O
been O
so O
long O
a O
one O
as O
before O
. O
And O
still O
as O
Ahab O
glided O
over O
the O
waves O
the O
unpitying O
sharks O
accompanied O
him O
; O
and O
so O
pertinaciously O
stuck O
to O
the O
boat O
; O
and O
so O
continually O
bit O
at O
the O
plying O
oars O
, O
that O
the O
blades O
became O
jagged O
and O
crunched O
, O
and O
left O
small O
splinters O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
at O
almost O
every O
dip O
. O
" O
Heed O
them O
not O
! O
those O
teeth O
but O
give O
new O
rowlocks O
to O
your O
oars O
. O
Pull O
on O
! O
't O
is O
the O
better O
rest O
, O
the O
sharks O
' O
jaw O
than O
the O
yielding O
water O
. O
" O
" O
But O
at O
every O
bite O
, O
sir O
, O
the O
thin O
blades O
grow O
smaller O
and O
smaller O
! O
" O
" O
They O
will O
last O
long O
enough O
! O
pull O
on O
! O
—But O
who O
can O
tell O
" O
— O
he O
muttered— O
" O
whether O
these O
sharks O
swim O
to O
feast O
on O
the O
whale O
or O
on O
Ahab O
? O
—But O
pull O
on O
! O
Aye O
, O
all O
alive O
, O
now—we O
near O
him O
. O
The O
helm O
! O
take O
the O
helm O
! O
let O
me O
pass O
, O
" O
—and O
so O
saying O
two O
of O
the O
oarsmen O
helped O
him O
forward O
to O
the O
bows O
of O
the O
still O
flying O
boat O
. O
At O
length O
as O
the O
craft O
was O
cast O
to O
one O
side O
, O
and O
ran O
ranging O
along O
with O
the O
White O
Whale O
's O
flank O
, O
he O
seemed O
strangely O
oblivious O
of O
its O
advance—as O
the O
whale O
sometimes O
will—and O
Ahab O
was O
fairly O
within O
the O
smoky O
mountain O
mist O
, O
which O
, O
thrown O
off O
from O
the O
whale O
's O
spout O
, O
curled O
round O
his O
great O
Monadnock O
hump O
; O
he O
was O
even O
thus O
close O
to O
him O
; O
when O
, O
with O
body O
arched O
back O
, O
and O
both O
arms O
lengthwise O
high-lifted O
to O
the O
poise O
, O
he O
darted O
his O
fierce O
iron O
, O
and O
his O
far O
fiercer O
curse O
into O
the O
hated O
whale O
. O
As O
both O
steel O
and O
curse O
sank O
to O
the O
socket O
, O
as O
if O
sucked O
into O
a O
morass O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
sideways O
writhed O
; O
spasmodically O
rolled O
his O
nigh O
flank O
against O
the O
bow O
, O
and O
, O
without O
staving O
a O
hole O
in O
it O
, O
so O
suddenly O
canted O
the O
boat O
over O
, O
that O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O
elevated O
part O
of O
the O
gunwale O
to O
which O
he O
then O
clung O
, O
Ahab O
would O
once O
more O
have O
been O
tossed O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
As O
it O
was O
, O
three O
of O
the O
oarsmen—who O
foreknew O
not O
the O
precise O
instant O
of O
the O
dart O
, O
and O
were O
therefore O
unprepared O
for O
its O
effects— O
these O
were O
flung O
out O
; O
but O
so O
fell O
, O
that O
, O
in O
an O
instant O
two O
of O
them O
clutched O
the O
gunwale O
again O
, O
and O
rising O
to O
its O
level O
on O
a O
combing O
wave O
, O
hurled O
themselves O
bodily O
inboard O
again O
; O
the O
third O
man O
helplessly O
dropping O
astern O
, O
but O
still O
afloat O
and O
swimming O
. O
Almost O
simultaneously O
, O
with O
a O
mighty O
volition O
of O
ungraduated O
, O
instantaneous O
swiftness O
, O
the O
White O
Whale O
darted O
through O
the O
weltering O
sea O
. O
But O
when O
Ahab O
cried O
out O
to O
the O
steersman O
to O
take O
new O
turns O
with O
the O
line O
, O
and O
hold O
it O
so O
; O
and O
commanded O
the O
crew O
to O
turn O
round O
on O
their O
seats O
, O
and O
tow O
the O
boat O
up O
to O
the O
mark O
; O
the O
moment O
the O
treacherous O
line O
felt O
that O
double O
strain O
and O
tug O
, O
it O
snapped O
in O
the O
empty O
air O
! O
" O
What O
breaks O
in O
me O
? O
Some O
sinew O
cracks O
! O
—'tis O
whole O
again O
; O
oars O
! O
oars O
! O
Burst O
in O
upon O
him O
! O
" O
Hearing O
the O
tremendous O
rush O
of O
the O
sea-crashing O
boat O
, O
the O
whale O
wheeled O
round O
to O
present O
his O
blank O
forehead O
at O
bay O
; O
but O
in O
that O
evolution O
, O
catching O
sight O
of O
the O
nearing O
black O
hull O
of O
the O
ship O
; O
seemingly O
seeing O
in O
it O
the O
source O
of O
all O
his O
persecutions O
; O
bethinking O
it—it O
may O
be—a O
larger O
and O
nobler O
foe O
; O
of O
a O
sudden O
, O
he O
bore O
down O
upon O
its O
advancing O
prow O
, O
smiting O
his O
jaws O
amid O
fiery O
showers O
of O
foam O
. O
Ahab O
staggered O
; O
his O
hand O
smote O
his O
forehead O
. O
" O
I O
grow O
blind O
; O
hands O
! O
stretch O
out O
before O
me O
that O
I O
may O
yet O
grope O

But O
as O
the O

forced O

the O
before O

from O

strangely O
vibrating O

I O
give O
up O

The O
harpoon O
was O
darted O

the O
stricken O

flew O
forward O
; O
with O
igniting O

line O
ran O
through O

grooves O
; O
—ran O
foul O

Ahab O
stooped O
to O
clear O
it O
; O
he O
did O
clear O
it O
; O
but O
the O
flying O
turn O
caught O
him O
round O

neck O

voicelessly O
as O
Turkish O
mutes O

Next O
instant O
, O
the O
heavy O
eye-splice O
in O
the O
rope O

final O
end O
flew O
out O
of O
the O
stark-empty O
tub O
, O
knocked O
down O
an O
oarsman O
, O
and O
smiting O
the O
sea O
, O
disappeared O
in O
its O
depths O
. O
For O
an O
instant O
, O
the O
tranced O
boat O

crew O
stood O
still O
; O
then O
turned O

" O
The O
ship O
? O
Great O
God O
, O
where O
is O
the O
ship O

" O
Soon O
they O
through O
dim O
, O
bewildering O
mediums O
saw O
her O
sidelong O
fading O
phantom O
, O
as O
in O
the O
gaseous O
Fata O
Morgana O
; O
only O
the O
uppermost O
masts O
out O
of O
water O
; O
while O
fixed O
by O
infatuation O
, O
or O
fidelity O
, O
or O
fate O
, O
to O
their O
once O
lofty O
perches O
, O
the O
pagan O
harpooneers O
still O
maintained O
their O
sinking O
look-outs O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
And O
now O
, O
concentric O
circles O
seized O
the O
lone O
boat O
itself O
, O
and O
all O
its O
crew O
, O
and O
each O
floating O
oar O
, O
and O
every O
lancepole O
, O
and O
spinning O
, O
animate O
and O
inanimate O
, O
all O
round O

round O
in O
one O
vortex O
, O
carried O
the O
smallest O
chip O
of O
the O
Pequod O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
But O
as O
the O
last O
whelmings O
intermixingly O
poured O
themselves O
over O
the O
sunken O
head O
of O
the O
Indian O
at O
the O
mainmast O
, O
leaving O
a O
few O
inches O
of O
the O
erect O
spar O
yet O
visible O
, O
together O
with O
long O
streaming O
yards O
of O
the O
flag O
, O
which O
calmly O
undulated O
, O
with O
ironical O
coincidings O
, O
over O
the O
destroying O
billows O
they O
almost O
touched O
; O
—at O
that O
instant O
, O
a O
red O
arm O
and O
a O
hammer O
hovered O
backwardly O
uplifted O
in O
the O
open O
air O
, O
in O
the O
act O
of O
nailing O
the O
flag O
faster O
and O
yet O
faster O
to O
the O
subsiding O
spar O
. O
A O
sky-hawk O
that O
tauntingly O
had O
followed O
the O
main-truck O
downwards O
from O
its O
natural O
home O
among O
the O
stars O
, O
pecking O
at O
the O
flag O
, O
and O
incommoding O
Tashtego O
there O
; O
this O
bird O
now O
chanced O
to O
intercept O
its O
broad O
fluttering O
wing O
between O
the O
hammer O
and O
the O
wood O
; O
and O
simultaneously O
feeling O
that O
etherial O
thrill O
, O
the O
submerged O
savage O
beneath O
, O
in O
his O
death-gasp O
, O
kept O
his O
hammer O
frozen O
there O
; O
and O
so O
the O
bird O
of O
heaven O
, O
with O
archangelic O
shrieks O
, O
and O
his O
imperial O
beak O
thrust O
upwards O
, O
and O
his O
whole O
captive O
form O
folded O
in O
the O
flag O
of O
Ahab O
, O
went O
down O
with O
his O
ship O
, O
which O
, O
like O
Satan O
, O
would O
not O
sink O
to O
hell O
till O
she O
had O
dragged O
a O
living O
part O
of O
heaven O
along O
with O
her O
, O
and O
helmeted O
herself O
with O
it O
. O
Now O
small O
fowls O
flew O
screaming O
over O
the O
yet O
yawning O
gulf O
; O
a O
sullen O
white O
surf O
beat O
against O
its O
steep O
sides O
; O
then O
all O
collapsed O
, O
and O
the O
great O
shroud O
of O
the O
sea O
rolled O
on O
as O
it O
rolled O
five O
thousand O
years O
ago O
