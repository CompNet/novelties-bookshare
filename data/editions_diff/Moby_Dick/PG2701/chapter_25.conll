In O
behalf O
of O
the O
dignity O
of O
whaling O
, O
I O
would O
fain O
advance O
naught O
but O
substantiated O
facts O
. O
But O
after O
embattling O
his O
facts O
, O
an O
advocate O
who O
should O
wholly O
suppress O
a O
not O
unreasonable O
surmise O
, O
which O
might O
tell O
eloquently O
upon O
his O
cause—such O
an O
advocate O
, O
would O
he O
not O
be O
blameworthy O
? O
It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
at O
the O
coronation O
of O
kings O
and O
queens O
, O
even O
modern O
ones O
, O
a O
certain O
curious O
process O
of O
seasoning O
them O
for O
their O
functions O
is O
gone O
through O
. O
There O
is O
a O
saltcellar O
of O
state O
, O
so O
called O
, O
and O
there O
may O
be O
a O
castor O
of O
state O
. O
How O
they O
use O
the O
salt O
, O
precisely—who O
knows O
? O
Certain O
I O
am O
, O
however O
, O
that O
a O
king O
's O
head O
is O
solemnly O
oiled O
at O
his O
coronation O
, O
even O
as O
a O
head O
of O
salad O
. O
Can O
it O
be O
, O
though O
, O
that O
they O
anoint O
it O
with O
a O
view O
of O
making O
its O
interior O
run O
well O
, O
as O
they O
anoint O
machinery O
? O
Much O
might O
be O
ruminated O
here O
, O
concerning O
the O
essential O
dignity O
of O
this O
regal O
process O
, O
because O
in O
common O
life O
we O
esteem O
but O
meanly O
and O
contemptibly O
a O
fellow O
who O
anoints O
his O
hair O
, O
and O
palpably O
smells O
of O
that O
anointing O
. O
In O
truth O
, O
a O
mature O
man O
who O
uses O
hair-oil O
, O
unless O
medicinally O
, O
that O
man O
has O
probably O
got O
a O
quoggy O
spot O
in O
him O
somewhere O
. O
As O
a O
general O
rule O
, O
he O
ca O
n't O
amount O
to O
much O
in O
his O
totality O
. O
But O
the O
only O
thing O
to O
be O
considered O
here O
, O
is O
this—what O
kind O
of O
oil O
is O
used O
at O
coronations O
? O
Certainly O
it O
can O
not O
be O
olive O
oil O
, O
nor O
macassar O
oil O
, O
nor O
castor O
oil O
, O
nor O
bear O
's O
oil O
, O
nor O
train O
oil O
, O
nor O
cod-liver O
oil O
. O
What O
then O
can O
it O
possibly O
be O
, O
but O
sperm O
oil O
in O
its O
unmanufactured O
, O
unpolluted O
state O
, O
the O
sweetest O
of O
all O
oils O
? O
Think O
of O
that O
, O
ye O
loyal O
Britons O
! O
we O
whalemen O
supply O
your O
kings O
and O
queens O
with O
coronation O
stuff O
! O
