Stubb O
's O
whale O
had O
been O
killed O
some O
distance O
from O
the O
ship O
. O
It O
was O
a O
calm O
; O
so O
, O
forming O
a O
tandem O
of O
three O
boats O
, O
we O
commenced O
the O
slow O
business O
of O
towing O
the O
trophy O
to O
the O
Pequod O
. O
And O
now O
, O
as O
we O
eighteen O
men O
with O
our O
thirty-six O
arms O
, O
and O
one O
hundred O
and O
eighty O
thumbs O
and O
fingers O
, O
slowly O
toiled O
hour O
after O
hour O
upon O
that O
inert O
, O
sluggish O
corpse O
in O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
it O
seemed O
hardly O
to O
budge O
at O
all O
, O
except O
at O
long O
intervals O
; O
good O
evidence O
was O
hereby O
furnished O
of O
the O
enormousness O
of O
the O
mass O
we O
moved O
. O
For O
, O
upon O
the O
great O
canal O
of O
Hang-Ho O
, O
or O
whatever O
they O
call O
it O
, O
in O
China O
, O
four O
or O
five O
laborers O
on O
the O
foot-path O
will O
draw O
a O
bulky O
freighted O
junk O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
a O
mile O
an O
hour O
; O
but O
this O
grand O
argosy O
we O
towed O
heavily O
forged O
along O
, O
as O
if O
laden O
with O
pig-lead O
in O
bulk O
. O
Darkness O
came O
on O
; O
but O
three O
lights O
up O
and O
down O
in O
the O
Pequod O
's O
main-rigging O
dimly O
guided O
our O
way O
; O
till O
drawing O
nearer O
we O
saw O
Ahab O
dropping O
one O
of O
several O
more O
lanterns O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
. O
Vacantly O
eyeing O
the O
heaving O
whale O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
he O
issued O
the O
usual O
orders O
for O
securing O
it O
for O
the O
night O
, O
and O
then O
handing O
his O
lantern O
to O
a O
seaman O
, O
went O
his O
way O
into O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
did O
not O
come O
forward O
again O
until O
morning O
. O
Though O
, O
in O
overseeing O
the O
pursuit O
of O
this O
whale O
, O
Captain O
Ahab O
had O
evinced O
his O
customary O
activity O
, O
to O
call O
it O
so O
; O
yet O
now O
that O
the O
creature O
was O
dead O
, O
some O
vague O
dissatisfaction O
, O
or O
impatience O
, O
or O
despair O
, O
seemed O
working O
in O
him O
; O
as O
if O
the O
sight O
of O
that O
dead O
body O
reminded O
him O
that O
Moby O
Dick O
was O
yet O
to O
be O
slain O
; O
and O
though O
a O
thousand O
other O
whales O
were O
brought O
to O
his O
ship O
, O
all O
that O
would O
not O
one O
jot O
advance O
his O
grand O
, O
monomaniac O
object O
. O
Very O
soon O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
from O
the O
sound O
on O
the O
Pequod O
's O
decks O
, O
that O
all O
hands O
were O
preparing O
to O
cast O
anchor O
in O
the O
deep O
; O
for O
heavy O
chains O
are O
being O
dragged O
along O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
thrust O
rattling O
out O
of O
the O
port-holes O
. O
But O
by O
those O
clanking O
links O
, O
the O
vast O
corpse O
itself O
, O
not O
the O
ship O
, O
is O
to O
be O
moored O
. O
Tied O
by O
the O
head O
to O
the O
stern O
, O
and O
by O
the O
tail O
to O
the O
bows O
, O
the O
whale O
now O
lies O
with O
its O
black O
hull O
close O
to O
the O
vessel O
's O
and O
seen O
through O
the O
darkness O
of O
the O
night O
, O
which O
obscured O
the O
spars O
and O
rigging O
aloft O
, O
the O
twoâ€”ship O
and O
whale O
, O
seemed O
yoked O
together O
like O
colossal O
bullocks O
, O
whereof O
one O
reclines O
while O
the O
other O
remains O
standing O
. O
* O
* O
A O
little O
item O
may O
as O
well O
be O
related O
here O
. O
The O
strongest O
and O
most O
reliable O
hold O
which O
the O
ship O
has O
upon O
the O
whale O
when O
moored O
alongside O
, O
is O
by O
the O
flukes O
or O
tail O
; O
and O
as O
from O
its O
greater O
density O
that O
part O
is O
relatively O
heavier O
than O
any O
other O
( O
excepting O
the O
side-fins O
) O
, O
its O
flexibility O
even O
in O
death O
, O
causes O
it O
to O
sink O
low O
beneath O
the O
surface O
; O
so O
that O
with O
the O
hand O
you O
can O
not O
get O
at O
it O
from O
the O
boat O
, O
in O
order O
to O
put O
the O
chain O
round O
it O
. O
But O
this O
difficulty O
is O
ingeniously O
overcome O
: O
a O
small O
, O
strong O
line O
is O
prepared O
with O
a O
wooden O
float O
at O
its O
outer O
end O
, O
and O
a O
weight O
in O
its O
middle O
, O
while O
the O
other O
end O
is O
secured O
to O
the O
ship O
. O
By O
adroit O
management O
the O
wooden O
float O
is O
made O
to O
rise O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
mass O
, O
so O
that O
now O
having O
girdled O
the O
whale O
, O
the O
chain O
is O
readily O
made O
to O
follow O
suit O
; O
and O
being O
slipped O
along O
the O
body O
, O
is O
at O
last O
locked O
fast O
round O
the O
smallest O
part O
of O
the O
tail O
, O
at O
the O
point O
of O
junction O
with O
its O
broad O
flukes O
or O
lobes O
. O
If O
moody O
Ahab O
was O
now O
all O
quiescence O
, O
at O
least O
so O
far O
as O
could O
be O
known O
on O
deck O
, O
Stubb O
, O
his O
second O
mate O
, O
flushed O
with O
conquest O
, O
betrayed O
an O
unusual O
but O
still O
good-natured O
excitement O
. O
Such O
an O
unwonted O
bustle O
was O
he O
in O
that O
the O
staid O
Starbuck O
, O
his O
official O
superior O
, O
quietly O
resigned O
to O
him O
for O
the O
time O
the O
sole O
management O
of O
affairs O
. O
One O
small O
, O
helping O
cause O
of O
all O
this O
liveliness O
in O
Stubb O
, O
was O
soon O
made O
strangely O
manifest O
. O
Stubb O
was O
a O
high O
liver O
; O
he O
was O
somewhat O
intemperately O
fond O
of O
the O
whale O
as O
a O
flavorish O
thing O
to O
his O
palate O
. O
" O
A O
steak O
, O
a O
steak O
, O
ere O
I O
sleep O
! O
You O
, O
Daggoo O
! O
overboard O
you O
go O
, O
and O
cut O
me O
one O
from O
his O
small O
! O
" O
Here O
be O
it O
known O
, O
that O
though O
these O
wild O
fishermen O
do O
not O
, O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
, O
and O
according O
to O
the O
great O
military O
maxim O
, O
make O
the O
enemy O
defray O
the O
current O
expenses O
of O
the O
war O
( O
at O
least O
before O
realizing O
the O
proceeds O
of O
the O
voyage O
) O
, O
yet O
now O
and O
then O
you O
find O
some O
of O
these O
Nantucketers O
who O
have O
a O
genuine O
relish O
for O
that O
particular O
part O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
designated O
by O
Stubb O
; O
comprising O
the O
tapering O
extremity O
of O
the O
body O
. O
About O
midnight O
that O
steak O
was O
cut O
and O
cooked O
; O
and O
lighted O
by O
two O
lanterns O
of O
sperm O
oil O
, O
Stubb O
stoutly O
stood O
up O
to O
his O
spermaceti O
supper O
at O
the O
capstan-head O
, O
as O
if O
that O
capstan O
were O
a O
sideboard O
. O
Nor O
was O
Stubb O
the O
only O
banqueter O
on O
whale O
's O
flesh O
that O
night O
. O
Mingling O
their O
mumblings O
with O
his O
own O
mastications O
, O
thousands O
on O
thousands O
of O
sharks O
, O
swarming O
round O
the O
dead O
leviathan O
, O
smackingly O
feasted O
on O
its O
fatness O
. O
The O
few O
sleepers O
below O
in O
their O
bunks O
were O
often O
startled O
by O
the O
sharp O
slapping O
of O
their O
tails O
against O
the O
hull O
, O
within O
a O
few O
inches O
of O
the O
sleepers O
' O
hearts O
. O
Peering O
over O
the O
side O
you O
could O
just O
see O
them O
( O
as O
before O
you O
heard O
them O
) O
wallowing O
in O
the O
sullen O
, O
black O
waters O
, O
and O
turning O
over O
on O
their O
backs O
as O
they O
scooped O
out O
huge O
globular O
pieces O
of O
the O
whale O
of O
the O
bigness O
of O
a O
human O
head O
. O
This O
particular O
feat O
of O
the O
shark O
seems O
all O
but O
miraculous O
. O
How O
at O
such O
an O
apparently O
unassailable O
surface O
, O
they O
contrive O
to O
gouge O
out O
such O
symmetrical O
mouthfuls O
, O
remains O
a O
part O
of O
the O
universal O
problem O
of O
all O
things O
. O
The O
mark O
they O
thus O
leave O
on O
the O
whale O
, O
may O
best O
be O
likened O
to O
the O
hollow O
made O
by O
a O
carpenter O
in O
countersinking O
for O
a O
screw O
. O
Though O
amid O
all O
the O
smoking O
horror O
and O
diabolism O
of O
a O
sea-fight O
, O
sharks O
will O
be O
seen O
longingly O
gazing O
up O
to O
the O
ship O
's O
decks O
, O
like O
hungry O
dogs O
round O
a O
table O
where O
red O
meat O
is O
being O
carved O
, O
ready O
to O
bolt O
down O
every O
killed O
man O
that O
is O
tossed O
to O
them O
; O
and O
though O
, O
while O
the O
valiant O
butchers O
over O
the O
deck-table O
are O
thus O
cannibally O
carving O
each O
other O
's O
live O
meat O
with O
carving-knives O
all O
gilded O
and O
tasselled O
, O
the O
sharks O
, O
also O
, O
with O
their O
jewel-hilted O
mouths O
, O
are O
quarrelsomely O
carving O
away O
under O
the O
table O
at O
the O
dead O
meat O
; O
and O
though O
, O
were O
you O
to O
turn O
the O
whole O
affair O
upside O
down O
, O
it O
would O
still O
be O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
a O
shocking O
sharkish O
business O
enough O
for O
all O
parties O
; O
and O
though O
sharks O
also O
are O
the O
invariable O
outriders O
of O
all O
slave O
ships O
crossing O
the O
Atlantic O
, O
systematically O
trotting O
alongside O
, O
to O
be O
handy O
in O
case O
a O
parcel O
is O
to O
be O
carried O
anywhere O
, O
or O
a O
dead O
slave O
to O
be O
decently O
buried O
; O
and O
though O
one O
or O
two O
other O
like O
instances O
might O
be O
set O
down O
, O
touching O
the O
set O
terms O
, O
places O
, O
and O
occasions O
, O
when O
sharks O
do O
most O
socially O
congregate O
, O
and O
most O
hilariously O
feast O
; O
yet O
is O
there O
no O
conceivable O
time O
or O
occasion O
when O
you O
will O
find O
them O
in O
such O
countless O
numbers O
, O
and O
in O
gayer O
or O
more O
jovial O
spirits O
, O
than O
around O
a O
dead O
sperm O
whale O
, O
moored O
by O
night O
to O
a O
whaleship O
at O
sea O
. O
If O
you O
have O
never O
seen O
that O
sight O
, O
then O
suspend O
your O
decision O
about O
the O
propriety O
of O
devil-worship O
, O
and O
the O
expediency O
of O
conciliating O
the O
devil O
. O
But O
, O
as O
yet O
, O
Stubb O
heeded O
not O
the O
mumblings O
of O
the O
banquet O
that O
was O
going O
on O
so O
nigh O
him O
, O
no O
more O
than O
the O
sharks O
heeded O
the O
smacking O
of O
his O
own O
epicurean O
lips O
. O
" O
Cook O
, O
cook O
! O
â€”where O
's O
that O
old O
Fleece O
? O
" O
he O
cried O
at O
length O
, O
widening O
his O
legs O
still O
further O
, O
as O
if O
to O
form O
a O
more O
secure O
base O
for O
his O
supper O
; O
and O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
darting O
his O
fork O
into O
the O
dish O
, O
as O
if O
stabbing O
with O
his O
lance O
; O
" O
cook O
, O

this O
way O
, O

" O
The O
old O
black O
, O
not O
in O
any O
very O
high O
glee O
at O
having O
been O
previously O
roused O
from O
his O
warm O
hammock O
at O
a O
most O
unseasonable O
hour O
, O
came O
shambling O
along O
from O
his O
galley O
, O
for O
, O
like O
many O
old O
blacks O
, O
there O
was O
something O
the O
matter O
with O
his O
knee-pans O
, O
which O
he O
did O
not O
keep O
well O
scoured O
like O
his O
other O
pans O
; O
this O
old O
Fleece O
, O
as O
they O
called O
him O
, O
came O
shuffling O
and O
limping O
along O
, O
assisting O
his O
step O
with O
his O
tongs O
, O
which O
, O
after O
a O
clumsy O
fashion O
, O
were O
made O
of O
straightened O
iron O
hoops O
; O
this O
old O
Ebony O
floundered O
along O
, O
and O
in O
obedience O
to O
the O
word O
of O
command O
, O
came O
to O
a O
dead O
stop O
on O
the O
opposite O
side O
of O
Stubb O
's O
sideboard O
; O
when O
, O
with O
both O
hands O
folded O
before O
him O
, O
and O
resting O
on O
his O
two-legged O
cane O
, O
he O
bowed O
his O
arched O
back O
still O
further O
over O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
sideways O
inclining O
his O
head O
, O
so O
as O
to O
bring O
his O
best O
ear O
into O
play O
. O
" O
Cook O

said O
Stubb O
, O
rapidly O
lifting O
a O
rather O
reddish O
morsel O
to O
his O
mouth O
, O
" O
do O
n't O
you O

always O

that O

must O
be O

Sullenly O
taking O
the O
offered O
lantern O
, O
old O
Fleece O
limped O
across O
the O
deck O
to O
the O
bulwarks O
; O

then O
, O
with O
one O
hand O
dropping O
his O
light O
low O
over O
the O
sea O

so O
as O
to O
get O
a O
good O
view O
of O

congregation O

with O

solemnly O
flourished O
his O
tongs O

leaning O
far O
over O
the O
side O
in O
a O
mumbling O
voice O
began O
addressing O
the O
sharks O

while O
Stubb O
, O
softly O
crawling O
behind O

overheard O
all O
