On O
Tower-hill O
, O
as O
you O
go O
down O
to O
the O
London O
docks O
, O
you O
may O
have O
seen O
a O
crippled O
beggar O
( O
or O
_kedger_ O
, O
as O
the O
sailors O
say O
) O
holding O
a O
painted O
board O
before O
him O
, O
representing O
the O
tragic O
scene O
in O
which O
he O
lost O
his O
leg O
. O
There O
are O
three O
whales O
and O
three O
boats O
; O
and O
one O
of O
the O
boats O
( O
presumed O
to O
contain O
the O
missing O
leg O
in O
all O
its O
original O
integrity O
) O
is O
being O
crunched O
by O
the O
jaws O
of O
the O
foremost O
whale O
. O
Any O
time O
these O
ten O
years O
, O
they O
tell O
me O
, O
has O
that O
man O
held O
up O
that O
picture O
, O
and O
exhibited O
that O
stump O
to O
an O
incredulous O
world O
. O
But O
the O
time O
of O
his O
justification O
has O
now O
come O
. O
His O
three O
whales O
are O
as O
good O
whales O
as O
were O
ever O
published O
in O
Wapping O
, O
at O
any O
rate O
; O
and O
his O
stump O
as O
unquestionable O
a O
stump O
as O
any O
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
western O
clearings O
. O
But O
, O
though O
for O
ever O
mounted O
on O
that O
stump O
, O
never O
a O
stump-speech O
does O
the O
poor O
whaleman O
make O
; O
but O
, O
with O
downcast O
eyes O
, O
stands O
ruefully O
contemplating O
his O
own O
amputation O
. O
Throughout O
the O
Pacific O
, O
and O
also O
in O
Nantucket O
, O
and O
New O
Bedford O
, O
and O
Sag O
Harbor O
, O
you O
will O
come O
across O
lively O
sketches O
of O
whales O
and O
whaling-scenes O
, O
graven O
by O
the O
fishermen O
themselves O
on O
Sperm O
Whale-teeth O
, O
or O
ladies O
' O
busks O
wrought O
out O
of O
the O
Right O
Whale-bone O
, O
and O
other O
like O
skrimshander O
articles O
, O
as O
the O
whalemen O
call O
the O
numerous O
little O
ingenious O
contrivances O
they O
elaborately O
carve O
out O
of O
the O
rough O
material O
, O
in O
their O
hours O
of O
ocean O
leisure O
. O
Some O
of O
them O
have O
little O
boxes O
of O
dentistical-looking O
implements O
, O
specially O
intended O
for O
the O
skrimshandering O
business O
. O
But O
, O
in O
general O
, O
they O
toil O
with O
their O
jack-knives O
alone O
; O
and O
, O
with O
that O
almost O
omnipotent O
tool O
of O
the O
sailor O
, O
they O
will O
turn O
you O
out O
anything O
you O
please O
, O
in O
the O
way O
of O
a O
mariner O
's O
fancy O
. O
Long O
exile O
from O
Christendom O
and O
civilization O
inevitably O
restores O
a O
man O
to O
that O
condition O
in O
which O
God O
placed O
him O
, O
_i.e._ O
what O
is O
called O
savagery O
. O
Your O
true O
whale-hunter O
is O
as O
much O
a O
savage O
as O
an O
Iroquois O
. O
I O
myself O
am O
a O
savage O
, O
owning O
no O
allegiance O
but O
to O
the O
King O
of O
the O
Cannibals O
; O
and O
ready O
at O
any O
moment O
to O
rebel O
against O
him O
. O
Now O
, O
one O
of O
the O
peculiar O
characteristics O
of O
the O
savage O
in O
his O
domestic O
hours O
, O
is O
his O
wonderful O
patience O
of O
industry O
. O
An O
ancient O
Hawaiian O
war-club O
or O
spear-paddle O
, O
in O
its O
full O
multiplicity O
and O
elaboration O
of O
carving O
, O
is O
as O
great O
a O
trophy O
of O
human O
perseverance O
as O
a O
Latin O
lexicon O
. O
For O
, O
with O
but O
a O
bit O
of O
broken O
sea-shell O
or O
a O
shark O
's O
tooth O
, O
that O
miraculous O
intricacy O
of O
wooden O
net-work O
has O
been O
achieved O
; O
and O
it O
has O
cost O
steady O
years O
of O
steady O
application O
. O
As O
with O
the O
Hawaiian O
savage O
, O
so O
with O
the O
white O
sailor-savage O
. O
With O
the O
same O
marvellous O
patience O
, O
and O
with O
the O
same O
single O
shark O
's O
tooth O
, O
of O
his O
one O
poor O
jack-knife O
, O
he O
will O
carve O
you O
a O
bit O
of O
bone O
sculpture O
, O
not O
quite O
as O
workmanlike O
, O
but O
as O
close O
packed O
in O
its O
maziness O
of O
design O
, O
as O
the O
Greek O
savage O
, O
Achilles O
's O
shield O
; O
and O
full O
of O
barbaric O
spirit O
and O
suggestiveness O
, O
as O
the O
prints O
of O
that O
fine O
old O
Dutch O
savage O
, O
Albert O
Durer O
. O
Wooden O
whales O
, O
or O
whales O
cut O
in O
profile O
out O
of O
the O
small O
dark O
slabs O
of O
the O
noble O
South O
Sea O
war-wood O
, O
are O
frequently O
met O
with O
in O
the O
forecastles O
of O
American O
whalers O
. O
Some O
of O
them O
are O
done O
with O
much O
accuracy O
. O
At O
some O
old O
gable-roofed O
country O
houses O
you O
will O
see O
brass O
whales O
hung O
by O
the O
tail O
for O
knockers O
to O
the O
road-side O
door O
. O
When O
the O
porter O
is O
sleepy O
, O
the O
anvil-headed O
whale O
would O
be O
best O
. O
But O
these O
knocking O
whales O
are O
seldom O
remarkable O
as O
faithful O
essays O
. O
On O
the O
spires O
of O
some O
old-fashioned O
churches O
you O
will O
see O
sheet-iron O
whales O
placed O
there O
for O
weather-cocks O
; O
but O
they O
are O
so O
elevated O
, O
and O
besides O
that O
are O
to O
all O
intents O
and O
purposes O
so O
labelled O
with O
" O
_Hands O
off O
! O
_ O
" O
you O
can O
not O
examine O
them O
closely O
enough O
to O
decide O
upon O
their O
merit O
. O
In O
bony O
, O
ribby O
regions O
of O
the O
earth O
, O
where O
at O
the O
base O
of O
high O
broken O
cliffs O
masses O
of O
rock O
lie O
strewn O
in O
fantastic O
groupings O
upon O
the O
plain O
, O
you O
will O
often O
discover O
images O
as O
of O
the O
petrified O
forms O
of O
the O
Leviathan O
partly O
merged O
in O
grass O
, O
which O
of O
a O
windy O
day O
breaks O
against O
them O
in O
a O
surf O
of O
green O
surges O
. O
Then O
, O
again O
, O
in O
mountainous O
countries O
where O
the O
traveller O
is O
continually O
girdled O
by O
amphitheatrical O
heights O
; O
here O
and O
there O
from O
some O
lucky O
point O
of O
view O
you O
will O
catch O
passing O
glimpses O
of O
the O
profiles O
of O
whales O
defined O
along O
the O
undulating O
ridges O
. O
But O
you O
must O
be O
a O
thorough O
whaleman O
, O
to O
see O
these O
sights O
; O
and O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
if O
you O
wish O
to O
return O
to O
such O
a O
sight O
again O
, O
you O
must O
be O
sure O
and O
take O
the O
exact O
intersecting O
latitude O
and O
longitude O
of O
your O
first O
stand-point O
, O
else O
so O
chance-like O
are O
such O
observations O
of O
the O
hills O
, O
that O
your O
precise O
, O
previous O
stand-point O
would O
require O
a O
laborious O
re-discovery O
; O
like O
the O
Soloma O
Islands O
, O
which O
still O
remain O
incognita O
, O
though O
once O
high-ruffed O
Mendanna O
trod O
them O
and O
old O
Figuera O
chronicled O
them O
. O
Nor O
when O
expandingly O
lifted O
by O
your O
subject O
, O
can O
you O
fail O
to O
trace O
out O
great O
whales O
in O
the O
starry O
heavens O
, O
and O
boats O
in O
pursuit O
of O
them O
; O
as O
when O
long O
filled O
with O
thoughts O
of O
war O
the O
Eastern O
nations O
saw O
armies O
locked O
in O
battle O
among O
the O
clouds O
. O
Thus O
at O
the O
North O
have O
I O
chased O
Leviathan O
round O
and O
round O
the O
Pole O
with O
the O
revolutions O
of O
the O
bright O
points O
that O
first O
defined O
him O
to O
me O
. O
And O
beneath O
the O
effulgent O
Antarctic O
skies O
I O
have O
boarded O
the O
Argo-Navis O
, O
and O
joined O
the O
chase O
against O
the O
starry O
Cetus O
far O
beyond O
the O
utmost O
stretch O
of O
Hydrus O
and O
the O
Flying O
Fish O
. O
With O
a O
frigate O
's O
anchors O
for O
my O
bridle-bitts O
and O
fasces O
of O
harpoons O
for O
spurs O
, O
would O
I O
could O
mount O
that O
whale O
and O
leap O
the O
topmost O
skies O
, O
to O
see O
whether O
the O
fabled O
heavens O
with O
all O
their O
countless O
tents O
really O
lie O
encamped O
beyond O
my O
mortal O
sight O
! O
