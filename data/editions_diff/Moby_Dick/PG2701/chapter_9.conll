Father O
Mapple O
rose O
, O
and O
in O
a O
mild O
voice O
of O
unassuming O
authority O
ordered O
the O
scattered O
people O
to O
condense O
. O
" O
Starboard O
gangway O
, O
there O
! O
side O
away O
to O
larboard—larboard O
gangway O
to O
starboard O
! O
Midships O
! O
midships O
! O
" O
There O
was O
a O
low O
rumbling O
of O
heavy O
sea-boots O
among O
the O
benches O
, O
and O
a O
still O
slighter O
shuffling O
of O
women O
's O
shoes O
, O
and O
all O
was O
quiet O
again O
, O
and O
every O
eye O
on O
the O
preacher O
. O
He O
paused O
a O
little O
; O
then O
kneeling O
in O
the O
pulpit O
's O
bows O
, O
folded O
his O
large O
brown O
hands O
across O
his O
chest O
, O
uplifted O
his O
closed O
eyes O
, O
and O
offered O
a O
prayer O
so O
deeply O
devout O
that O
he O
seemed O
kneeling O
and O
praying O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
This O
ended O
, O
in O
prolonged O
solemn O
tones O
, O
like O
the O
continual O
tolling O
of O
a O
bell O
in O
a O
ship O
that O
is O
foundering O
at O
sea O
in O
a O
fog—in O
such O
tones O
he O
commenced O
reading O
the O
following O
hymn O
; O
but O
changing O
his O
manner O
towards O
the O
concluding O
stanzas O
, O
burst O
forth O
with O
a O
pealing O
exultation O
and O
joy— O
" O
The O
ribs O
and O
terrors O
in O
the O
whale O
, O
Arched O
over O
me O
a O
dismal O
gloom O
, O
While O
all O
God O
's O
sun-lit O
waves O
rolled O
by O
, O
And O
lift O
me O
deepening O
down O
to O
doom O
. O
" O
I O
saw O
the O
opening O
maw O
of O
hell O
, O
With O
endless O
pains O
and O
sorrows O
there O
; O
Which O
none O
but O
they O
that O
feel O
can O
tell— O
Oh O
, O
I O
was O
plunging O
to O
despair O
. O
" O
In O
black O
distress O
, O
I O
called O
my O
God O
, O
When O
I O
could O
scarce O
believe O
him O
mine O
, O
He O
bowed O
his O
ear O
to O
my O
complaints— O
No O
more O
the O
whale O
did O
me O
confine O
. O
" O
With O
speed O
he O
flew O
to O
my O
relief O
, O
As O
on O
a O
radiant O
dolphin O
borne O
; O
Awful O
, O
yet O
bright O
, O
as O
lightning O
shone O
The O
face O
of O
my O
Deliverer O
God O
. O
" O
My O
song O
for O
ever O
shall O
record O
That O
terrible O
, O
that O
joyful O
hour O
; O
I O
give O
the O
glory O
to O
my O
God O
, O
His O
all O
the O
mercy O
and O
the O
power O
. O
" O
Nearly O
all O
joined O
in O
singing O
this O
hymn O
, O
which O
swelled O
high O
above O
the O
howling O
of O
the O
storm O
. O
A O
brief O
pause O
ensued O
; O
the O
preacher O
slowly O
turned O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
the O
Bible O
, O
and O
at O
last O
, O
folding O
his O
hand O
down O
upon O
the O
proper O
page O
, O
said O
: O
" O
Beloved O
shipmates O
, O
clinch O
the O
last O
verse O
of O
the O
first O
chapter O
of O
Jonah—'And O
God O
had O
prepared O
a O
great O
fish O
to O
swallow O
up O
Jonah O
. O
' O
" O
" O
Shipmates O
, O
this O
book O
, O
containing O
only O
four O
chapters—four O
yarns—is O
one O
of O
the O
smallest O
strands O
in O
the O
mighty O
cable O
of O
the O
Scriptures O
. O
Yet O
what O
depths O
of O
the O
soul O
does O
Jonah O
's O
deep O
sealine O
sound O
! O
what O
a O
pregnant O
lesson O
to O
us O
is O
this O
prophet O
! O
What O
a O
noble O
thing O
is O
that O
canticle O
in O
the O
fish O
's O
belly O
! O
How O
billow-like O
and O
boisterously O
grand O
! O
We O
feel O
the O
floods O
surging O
over O
us O
; O
we O
sound O
with O
him O
to O
the O
kelpy O
bottom O
of O
the O
waters O
; O
sea-weed O
and O
all O
the O
slime O
of O
the O
sea O
is O
about O
us O
! O
But O
_what_ O
is O
this O
lesson O
that O
the O
book O
of O
Jonah O
teaches O
? O
Shipmates O
, O
it O
is O
a O
two-stranded O
lesson O
; O
a O
lesson O
to O
us O
all O
as O
sinful O
men O
, O
and O
a O
lesson O
to O
me O
as O
a O
pilot O
of O
the O
living O
God O
. O
As O
sinful O
men O
, O
it O
is O
a O
lesson O
to O
us O
all O
, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
story O
of O
the O
sin O
, O
hard-heartedness O
, O
suddenly O
awakened O
fears O
, O
the O
swift O
punishment O
, O
repentance O
, O
prayers O
, O
and O
finally O
the O
deliverance O
and O
joy O
of O
Jonah O
. O
As O
with O
all O
sinners O
among O
men O
, O
the O
sin O
of O
this O
son O
of O
Amittai O
was O
in O
his O
wilful O
disobedience O
of O
the O
command O
of O
God—never O
mind O
now O
what O
that O
command O
was O
, O
or O
how O
conveyed—which O
he O
found O
a O
hard O
command O
. O
But O
all O
the O
things O
that O
God O
would O
have O
us O
do O
are O
hard O
for O
us O
to O
do—remember O
that—and O
hence O
, O
he O
oftener O
commands O
us O
than O
endeavors O
to O
persuade O
. O
And O
if O
we O
obey O
God O
, O
we O
must O
disobey O
ourselves O
; O
and O
it O
is O
in O
this O
disobeying O
ourselves O
, O
wherein O
the O
hardness O
of O
obeying O
God O
consists O
. O
" O
With O
this O
sin O
of O
disobedience O
in O
him O
, O
Jonah O
still O
further O
flouts O
at O
God O
, O
by O
seeking O
to O
flee O
from O
Him O
. O
He O
thinks O
that O
a O
ship O
made O
by O
men O
will O
carry O
him O
into O
countries O
where O
God O
does O
not O
reign O
, O
but O
only O
the O
Captains O
of O
this O
earth O
. O
He O
skulks O
about O
the O
wharves O
of O
Joppa O
, O
and O
seeks O
a O
ship O
that O
's O
bound O
for O
Tarshish O
. O
There O
lurks O
, O
perhaps O
, O
a O
hitherto O
unheeded O
meaning O
here O
. O
By O
all O
accounts O
Tarshish O
could O
have O
been O
no O
other O
city O
than O
the O
modern O
Cadiz O
. O
That O
's O
the O
opinion O
of O
learned O
men O
. O
And O
where O
is O
Cadiz O
, O
shipmates O
? O
Cadiz O
is O
in O
Spain O
; O
as O
far O
by O
water O
, O
from O
Joppa O
, O
as O
Jonah O
could O
possibly O
have O
sailed O
in O
those O
ancient O
days O
, O
when O
the O
Atlantic O
was O
an O
almost O
unknown O
sea O
. O
Because O
Joppa O
, O
the O
modern O
Jaffa O
, O
shipmates O
, O
is O
on O
the O
most O
easterly O
coast O
of O
the O
Mediterranean O
, O
the O
Syrian O
; O
and O
Tarshish O
or O
Cadiz O
more O
than O
two O
thousand O
miles O
to O
the O
westward O
from O
that O
, O
just O
outside O
the O
Straits O
of O
Gibraltar O
. O
See O
ye O
not O
then O
, O
shipmates O
, O
that O
Jonah O
sought O
to O
flee O
world-wide O
from O
God O
? O
Miserable O
man O
! O
Oh O
! O
most O
contemptible O
and O
worthy O
of O
all O
scorn O
; O
with O
slouched O
hat O
and O
guilty O
eye O
, O
skulking O
from O
his O
God O
; O
prowling O
among O
the O
shipping O
like O
a O
vile O
burglar O
hastening O
to O
cross O
the O
seas O
. O
So O
disordered O
, O
self-condemning O
is O
his O
look O
, O
that O
had O
there O
been O
policemen O
in O
those O
days O
, O
Jonah O
, O
on O
the O
mere O
suspicion O
of O
something O
wrong O
, O
had O
been O
arrested O
ere O
he O
touched O
a O
deck O
. O
How O
plainly O
he O
's O
a O
fugitive O
! O
no O
baggage O
, O
not O
a O
hat-box O
, O
valise O
, O
or O
carpet-bag O
, O
—no O
friends O
accompany O
him O
to O
the O
wharf O
with O
their O
adieux O
. O
At O
last O
, O
after O
much O
dodging O
search O
, O
he O
finds O
the O
Tarshish O
ship O
receiving O
the O
last O
items O
of O
her O
cargo O
; O
and O
as O
he O
steps O
on O
board O
to O
see O
its O
Captain O
in O
the O
cabin O
, O
all O
the O
sailors O
for O
the O
moment O
desist O
from O
hoisting O
in O
the O
goods O
, O
to O
mark O
the O
stranger O
's O
evil O
eye O
. O
Jonah O
sees O
this O
; O
but O
in O
vain O
he O
tries O
to O
look O
all O
ease O
and O
confidence O
; O
in O
vain O
essays O
his O
wretched O
smile O
. O
Strong O
intuitions O
of O
the O
man O
assure O
the O
mariners O
he O
can O
be O
no O
innocent O
. O
In O
their O
gamesome O
but O
still O
serious O
way O
, O
one O
whispers O
to O
the O
other— O
" O
Jack O
, O
he O
's O
robbed O
a O
widow O
; O
" O
or O
, O
" O
Joe O
, O
do O
you O
mark O
him O
; O
he O
's O
a O
bigamist O
; O
" O
or O
, O
" O
Harry O
lad O
, O
I O
guess O
he O
's O
the O
adulterer O
that O
broke O
jail O
in O
old O
Gomorrah O
, O
or O
belike O
, O
one O
of O
the O
missing O
murderers O
from O
Sodom O
. O
" O
Another O
runs O
to O
read O
the O
bill O
that O
's O
stuck O
against O
the O
spile O
upon O
the O
wharf O
to O
which O
the O
ship O
is O
moored O
, O
offering O
five O
hundred O
gold O
coins O
for O
the O
apprehension O
of O
a O
parricide O
, O
and O
containing O
a O
description O
of O
his O
person O
. O
He O
reads O
, O
and O
looks O
from O
Jonah O
to O
the O
bill O
; O
while O
all O
his O
sympathetic O
shipmates O
now O
crowd O
round O
Jonah O
, O
prepared O
to O
lay O
their O
hands O
upon O
him O
. O
Frighted O
Jonah O
trembles O
, O
and O
summoning O
all O
his O
boldness O
to O
his O
face O
, O
only O
looks O
so O
much O
the O
more O
a O
coward O
. O
He O
will O
not O
confess O
himself O
suspected O
; O
but O
that O
itself O
is O
strong O
suspicion O
. O
So O
he O
makes O
the O
best O
of O
it O
; O
and O
when O
the O
sailors O
find O
him O
not O
to O
be O
the O
man O
that O
is O
advertised O
, O
they O
let O
him O
pass O
, O
and O
he O
descends O
into O
the O
cabin O
. O
" O
'Who O
's O
there O
? O
' O
cries O
the O
Captain O
at O
his O
busy O
desk O
, O
hurriedly O
making O
out O
his O
papers O
for O
the O
Customs—'Who O
's O
there O
? O
' O
Oh O
! O
how O
that O
harmless O
question O
mangles O
Jonah O
! O
For O
the O
instant O
he O
almost O
turns O
to O
flee O
again O
. O
But O
he O
rallies O
. O
' O
I O
seek O
a O
passage O
in O
this O
ship O
to O
Tarshish O
; O
how O
soon O
sail O
ye O
, O
sir O
? O
' O
Thus O
far O
the O
busy O
Captain O
had O
not O
looked O
up O
to O
Jonah O
, O
though O
the O
man O
now O
stands O
before O
him O
; O
but O
no O
sooner O
does O
he O
hear O
that O
hollow O
voice O
, O
than O
he O
darts O
a O
scrutinizing O
glance O
. O
'We O
sail O
with O
the O
next O
coming O
tide O
, O
' O
at O
last O
he O
slowly O
answered O
, O
still O
intently O
eyeing O
him O
. O
'No O
sooner O
, O
sir O
? O
'—'Soon O
enough O
for O
any O
honest O
man O
that O
goes O
a O
passenger O
. O
' O
Ha O
! O
Jonah O
, O
that O
's O
another O
stab O
. O
But O
he O
swiftly O
calls O
away O
the O
Captain O
from O
that O
scent O
. O
' O
I O
'll O
sail O
with O
ye O
, O
'—he O
says O
, O
—'the O
passage O
money O
how O
much O
is O
that O
? O
—I O
'll O
pay O
now O
. O
' O
For O
it O
is O
particularly O
written O
, O
shipmates O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
thing O
not O
to O
be O
overlooked O
in O
this O
history O
, O
'that O
he O
paid O
the O
fare O
thereof O
' O
ere O
the O
craft O
did O
sail O
. O
And O
taken O
with O
the O
context O
, O
this O
is O
full O
of O
meaning O
. O
" O
Now O
Jonah O
's O
Captain O
, O
shipmates O
, O
was O
one O
whose O
discernment O
detects O
crime O
in O
any O
, O
but O
whose O
cupidity O
exposes O
it O
only O
in O
the O
penniless O
. O
In O
this O
world O
, O
shipmates O
, O
sin O
that O
pays O
its O
way O
can O
travel O
freely O
, O
and O
without O
a O
passport O
; O
whereas O
Virtue O
, O
if O
a O
pauper O
, O
is O
stopped O
at O
all O
frontiers O
. O
So O
Jonah O
's O
Captain O
prepares O
to O
test O
the O
length O
of O
Jonah O
's O
purse O
, O
ere O
he O
judge O
him O
openly O
. O
He O
charges O
him O
thrice O
the O
usual O
sum O
; O
and O
it O
's O
assented O
to O
. O
Then O
the O
Captain O
knows O
that O
Jonah O
is O
a O
fugitive O
; O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
resolves O
to O
help O
a O
flight O
that O
paves O
its O
rear O
with O
gold O
. O
Yet O
when O
Jonah O
fairly O
takes O
out O
his O
purse O
, O
prudent O
suspicions O
still O
molest O
the O
Captain O
. O
He O
rings O
every O
coin O
to O
find O
a O
counterfeit O
. O
Not O
a O
forger O
, O
any O
way O
, O
he O
mutters O
; O
and O
Jonah O
is O
put O
down O
for O
his O
passage O
. O
'Point O
out O
my O
state-room O
, O
Sir O
, O
' O
says O
Jonah O
now O
, O
' O
I O
'm O
travel-weary O
; O
I O
need O
sleep O
. O
' O
'Thou O
lookest O
like O
it O
, O
' O
says O
the O
Captain O
, O
'there O
's O
thy O
room O
. O
' O
Jonah O
enters O
, O
and O
would O
lock O
the O
door O
, O
but O
the O
lock O
contains O
no O
key O
. O
Hearing O
him O
foolishly O
fumbling O
there O
, O
the O
Captain O
laughs O
lowly O
to O
himself O
, O
and O
mutters O
something O
about O
the O
doors O
of O
convicts O
' O
cells O
being O
never O
allowed O
to O
be O
locked O
within O
. O
All O
dressed O
and O
dusty O
as O
he O
is O
, O
Jonah O
throws O
himself O
into O
his O
berth O
, O
and O
finds O
the O
little O
state-room O
ceiling O
almost O
resting O
on O
his O
forehead O
. O
The O
air O
is O
close O
, O
and O
Jonah O
gasps O
. O
Then O
, O
in O
that O
contracted O
hole O
, O
sunk O
, O
too O
, O
beneath O
the O
ship O
's O
water-line O
, O
Jonah O
feels O
the O
heralding O
presentiment O
of O
that O
stifling O
hour O
, O
when O
the O
whale O
shall O
hold O
him O
in O
the O
smallest O
of O
his O
bowels O
' O
wards O
. O
" O
Screwed O
at O
its O
axis O
against O
the O
side O
, O
a O
swinging O
lamp O
slightly O
oscillates O
in O
Jonah O
's O
room O
; O
and O
the O
ship O
, O
heeling O
over O
towards O
the O
wharf O
with O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
last O
bales O
received O
, O
the O
lamp O
, O
flame O
and O
all O
, O
though O
in O
slight O
motion O
, O
still O
maintains O
a O
permanent O
obliquity O
with O
reference O
to O
the O
room O
; O
though O
, O
in O
truth O
, O
infallibly O
straight O
itself O
, O
it O
but O
made O
obvious O
the O
false O
, O
lying O
levels O
among O
which O
it O
hung O
. O
The O
lamp O
alarms O
and O
frightens O
Jonah O
; O
as O
lying O
in O
his O
berth O
his O
tormented O
eyes O
roll O
round O
the O
place O
, O
and O
this O
thus O
far O
successful O
fugitive O
finds O
no O
refuge O
for O
his O
restless O
glance O
. O
But O
that O

one O
who O
after O
a O
night O
of O
drunken O
revelry O
hies O
to O
his O
bed O
, O
still O
reeling O
, O
but O
with O
conscience O
yet O
pricking O
him O
, O
as O
the O
plungings O
of O
the O
Roman O
race-horse O
but O
so O
much O
the O
more O
strike O
his O
steel O
tags O
into O
him O
; O
as O
one O
who O
in O
that O
miserable O
plight O
still O
turns O
and O
turns O
in O
giddy O
anguish O
, O
praying O
God O
for O
annihilation O
until O
the O
fit O
be O
passed O
; O
and O
at O
last O
amid O
the O
whirl O
of O
woe O
he O
feels O
, O
a O
deep O
stupor O
steals O
over O
him O
, O
as O
over O
the O
man O
who O
bleeds O
to O
death O
, O
for O
conscience O
is O
the O
wound O
, O
and O
there O
's O
naught O

staunch O
it O
; O
so O
, O
after O
sore O
wrestlings O
in O
his O
berth O
, O
Jonah O
's O
prodigy O
of O
ponderous O
misery O
drags O
him O
drowning O
down O
to O
sleep O
. O
" O
And O
now O
the O
time O
of O
tide O
has O
come O
; O
the O
ship O
casts O
off O
her O
cables O
; O
and O
from O
the O
deserted O
wharf O
the O
uncheered O
ship O
for O
Tarshish O
, O
all O
careening O
, O
glides O
to O
sea O
. O
That O
ship O
, O
my O
friends O
, O
was O
the O
first O
of O
recorded O
smugglers O
! O
the O
contraband O
was O
Jonah O
. O
But O
the O
sea O
rebels O
; O
he O
will O
not O
bear O
the O
wicked O
burden O
. O
A O
dreadful O
storm O
comes O
on O
, O
the O
ship O
is O
like O
to O
break O
. O
But O
now O
when O
the O
boatswain O
calls O
all O
hands O
to O
lighten O
her O
; O
when O
boxes O
, O
bales O
, O
and O
jars O
are O
clattering O
overboard O
; O
when O
the O
wind O
is O
shrieking O
, O
and O
the O
men O
are O
yelling O
, O
and O
every O
plank O
thunders O
with O
trampling O
feet O
right O
over O
Jonah O
's O
head O
; O
in O
all O
this O
raging O
tumult O
, O
Jonah O
sleeps O
his O
hideous O
sleep O
. O
He O
sees O
no O
black O
sky O
and O
raging O
sea O
, O
feels O
not O
the O
reeling O
timbers O
, O
and O
little O
hears O
he O
or O
heeds O
he O
the O
far O
rush O
of O
the O
mighty O
whale O
, O
which O
even O
now O
with O
open O
mouth O
is O
cleaving O
the O
seas O
after O
him O
. O
Aye O
, O
shipmates O
, O
Jonah O
was O
gone O
down O
into O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
ship—a O
berth O
in O
the O
cabin O
as O
I O
have O
taken O
it O
, O
and O
was O
fast O
asleep O
. O
But O
the O
frightened O
master O
comes O
to O
him O
, O
and O
shrieks O
in O
his O
dead O
ear O
, O
'What O
meanest O
thou O
, O
O O
, O
sleeper O
! O
arise O
! O
' O
Startled O
from O
his O
lethargy O
by O
that O
direful O
cry O
, O
Jonah O
staggers O
to O
his O
feet O
, O
and O
stumbling O
to O
the O
deck O
, O
grasps O
a O
shroud O
, O
to O
look O
out O
upon O
the O
sea O
. O
But O
at O
that O
moment O
he O
is O
sprung O
upon O
by O
a O
panther O
billow O
leaping O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
. O
Wave O
after O
wave O
thus O
leaps O
into O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
finding O
no O
speedy O
vent O
runs O
roaring O
fore O
and O
aft O
, O
till O
the O
mariners O
come O
nigh O
to O
drowning O
while O
yet O
afloat O
. O
And O
ever O
, O
as O
the O
white O
moon O
shows O
her O
affrighted O
face O
from O
the O
steep O
gullies O
in O
the O
blackness O
overhead O
, O
aghast O
Jonah O
sees O
the O
rearing O
bowsprit O
pointing O
high O
upward O
, O
but O
soon O
beat O
downward O
again O
towards O
the O
tormented O
deep O
. O
" O
Terrors O
upon O
terrors O
run O
shouting O
through O
his O
soul O
. O
In O
all O
his O
cringing O
attitudes O
, O
the O
God-fugitive O
is O
now O
too O
plainly O
known O
. O
The O
sailors O
mark O
him O
; O
more O
and O
more O
certain O
grow O
their O
suspicions O
of O
him O
, O
and O
at O
last O
, O
fully O
to O
test O
the O
truth O
, O
by O
referring O
the O
whole O
matter O
to O
high O
Heaven O
, O
they O
fall O
to O
casting O
lots O
, O
to O
see O
for O
whose O
cause O
this O
great O
tempest O
was O
upon O
them O
. O
The O
lot O
is O
Jonah O
's O
; O
that O
discovered O
, O
then O
how O
furiously O
they O
mob O
him O
with O
their O
questions O
. O
'What O
is O
thine O
occupation O
? O
Whence O
comest O
thou O
? O
Thy O
country O
? O
What O
people O
? O
But O
mark O
now O
, O
my O
shipmates O
, O
the O
behavior O
of O
poor O
Jonah O
. O
The O
eager O
mariners O
but O
ask O
him O
who O
he O
is O
, O
and O
where O
from O
; O
whereas O
, O
they O
not O
only O
receive O
an O
answer O
to O
those O
questions O
, O
but O
likewise O
another O
answer O
to O
a O
question O
not O
put O
by O
them O
, O
but O
the O
unsolicited O
answer O
is O
forced O
from O
Jonah O
by O
the O
hard O
hand O
of O
God O
that O
is O
upon O
him O
. O
" O
' O
I O
am O
a O
Hebrew O
, O
' O
he O
cries—and O
then— O
' O
I O
fear O
the O
Lord O
the O
God O
of O
Heaven O
who O
hath O
made O
the O
sea O
and O
the O
dry O
land O
! O
' O
Fear O
him O
, O
O O
Jonah O
? O
Aye O
, O
well O
mightest O
thou O
fear O
the O
Lord O
God O
_then O
! O
_ O
Straightway O
, O
he O
now O
goes O
on O
to O
make O
a O
full O
confession O
; O
whereupon O
the O
mariners O
became O
more O
and O
more O
appalled O
, O
but O
still O
are O
pitiful O
. O
For O
when O
Jonah O
, O
not O
yet O
supplicating O
God O
for O
mercy O
, O
since O
he O
but O
too O
well O
knew O
the O
darkness O
of O
his O
deserts O
, O
—when O
wretched O
Jonah O
cries O
out O
to O
them O
to O
take O
him O
and O
cast O
him O
forth O
into O
the O
sea O
, O
for O
he O
knew O
that O
for O
_his_ O
sake O
this O
great O
tempest O
was O
upon O
them O
; O
they O
mercifully O
turn O
from O
him O
, O
and O
seek O
by O
other O
means O
to O
save O
the O
ship O
. O
But O
all O
in O
vain O
; O
the O
indignant O
gale O
howls O
louder O
; O
then O
, O
with O
one O
hand O
raised O
invokingly O
to O
God O
, O
with O
the O
other O
they O
not O
unreluctantly O
lay O
hold O
of O
Jonah O
. O
" O
And O
now O
behold O
Jonah O
taken O
up O
as O
an O
anchor O
and O
dropped O
into O
the O
sea O
; O
when O
instantly O
an O
oily O
calmness O
floats O
out O
from O
the O
east O
, O
and O
the O
sea O
is O
still O
, O
as O
Jonah O
carries O
down O
the O
gale O
with O
him O
, O
leaving O
smooth O
water O
behind O
. O
He O
goes O
down O
in O
the O
whirling O
heart O
of O
such O
a O
masterless O
commotion O
that O
he O
scarce O
heeds O
the O
moment O
when O
he O
drops O
seething O
into O
the O
yawning O
jaws O
awaiting O
him O
; O
and O
the O
whale O
shoots-to O
all O
his O
ivory O
teeth O
, O
like O
so O
many O
white O
bolts O
, O
upon O
his O
prison O
. O
Then O
Jonah O
prayed O
unto O
the O
Lord O
out O
of O
the O
fish O
's O
belly O
. O
But O
observe O
his O
prayer O
, O
and O
learn O
a O
weighty O
lesson O
. O
For O
sinful O
as O
he O
is O
, O
Jonah O
does O
not O
weep O
and O
wail O
for O
direct O
deliverance O
. O
He O
feels O
that O
his O
dreadful O
punishment O
is O
just O
. O
He O
leaves O
all O
his O
deliverance O
to O
God O
, O
contenting O
himself O
with O
this O
, O
that O
spite O
of O
all O
his O
pains O
and O
pangs O
, O
he O
will O
still O
look O
towards O
His O
holy O
temple O
. O
And O
here O
, O
shipmates O
, O
is O
true O
and O
faithful O
repentance O
; O
not O
clamorous O
for O
pardon O
, O
but O
grateful O
for O
punishment O
. O
And O
how O
pleasing O
to O
God O
was O
this O
conduct O
in O
Jonah O
, O
is O
shown O
in O
the O
eventual O
deliverance O
of O
him O
from O
the O
sea O
and O
the O
whale O
. O
Shipmates O
, O
I O
do O
not O
place O
Jonah O
before O
you O
to O
be O
copied O
for O
his O
sin O
but O
I O
do O
place O
him O
before O
you O
as O
a O
model O
for O
repentance O
. O
Sin O
not O
; O
but O
if O
you O
do O
, O
take O
heed O
to O
repent O
of O
it O
like O
Jonah O
. O
" O
While O
he O
was O
speaking O
these O
words O
, O
the O
howling O
of O
the O
shrieking O
, O
slanting O
storm O
without O
seemed O
to O
add O
new O
power O
to O
the O
preacher O
, O
who O
, O
when O
describing O
Jonah O
's O
sea-storm O
, O
seemed O
tossed O
by O
a O
storm O
himself O
. O
His O
deep O
chest O
heaved O
as O
with O
a O
ground-swell O
; O
his O
tossed O
arms O
seemed O
the O
warring O
elements O
at O
work O
; O
and O
the O
thunders O
that O
rolled O
away O
from O
off O
his O
swarthy O
brow O
, O
and O
the O
light O
leaping O
from O
his O
eye O
, O
made O
all O
his O
simple O
hearers O
look O
on O
him O
with O
a O
quick O
fear O
that O
was O
strange O
to O
them O
. O
There O
now O
came O
a O
lull O
in O
his O
look O
, O
as O
he O
silently O
turned O
over O
the O
leaves O
of O
the O
Book O
once O
more O
; O
and O
, O
at O
last O
, O
standing O
motionless O
, O
with O
closed O
eyes O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
seemed O
communing O
with O
God O
and O
himself O
. O
But O
again O
he O
leaned O
over O
towards O
the O
people O
, O
and O
bowing O
his O
head O
lowly O
, O
with O
an O
aspect O
of O
the O
deepest O
yet O
manliest O
humility O
, O
he O
spake O
these O
words O
: O
" O
Shipmates O
, O
God O
has O
laid O
but O
one O
hand O
upon O
you O
; O
both O
his O
hands O
press O
upon O
me O
. O
I O
have O
read O
ye O
by O
what O
murky O
light O
may O
be O
mine O
the O
lesson O
that O
Jonah O
teaches O
to O
all O
sinners O
; O
and O
therefore O
to O
ye O
, O
and O
still O
more O
to O
me O
, O
for O
I O
am O
a O
greater O
sinner O
than O
ye O
. O
And O
now O
how O
gladly O
would O
I O
come O
down O
from O
this O
mast-head O
and O
sit O
on O
the O
hatches O
there O
where O
you O
sit O
, O
and O
listen O
as O
you O
listen O
, O
while O
some O
one O
of O
you O
reads O
_me_ O
that O
other O
and O
more O
awful O
lesson O
which O
Jonah O
teaches O
to O
_me_ O
, O
as O
a O
pilot O
of O
the O
living O
God O
. O
How O
being O
an O
anointed O
pilot-prophet O
, O
or O
speaker O
of O
true O
things O
, O
and O
bidden O
by O
the O
Lord O
to O
sound O
those O
unwelcome O
truths O
in O
the O
ears O
of O
a O
wicked O
Nineveh O
, O
Jonah O
, O
appalled O
at O
the O
hostility O
he O
should O
raise O
, O
fled O
from O
his O
mission O
, O
and O
sought O
to O
escape O
his O
duty O
and O
his O
God O
by O
taking O
ship O
at O
Joppa O
. O
But O
God O
is O
everywhere O
; O
Tarshish O
he O
never O
reached O
. O
As O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
God O
came O
upon O
him O
in O
the O
whale O
, O
and O
swallowed O
him O
down O
to O
living O
gulfs O
of O
doom O
, O
and O
with O
swift O
slantings O
tore O
him O
along O
'into O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
seas O
, O
' O
where O
the O
eddying O
depths O
sucked O
him O
ten O
thousand O
fathoms O
down O
, O
and O
'the O
weeds O
were O
wrapped O
about O
his O
head O
, O
' O
and O
all O
the O
watery O
world O
of O
woe O
bowled O
over O
him O
. O
Yet O
even O
then O
beyond O
the O
reach O
of O
any O
plummet—'out O
of O
the O
belly O
of O
hell'—when O
the O
whale O
grounded O
upon O
the O
ocean O
's O
utmost O
bones O
, O
even O
then O
, O
God O
heard O
the O
engulphed O
, O
repenting O
prophet O
when O
he O
cried O
. O
Then O
God O
spake O
unto O
the O
fish O
; O
and O
from O
the O
shuddering O
cold O
and O
blackness O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
whale O
came O
breeching O
up O
towards O
the O
warm O
and O
pleasant O
sun O
, O
and O
all O
the O
delights O
of O
air O
and O
earth O
; O
and O
'vomited O
out O
Jonah O
upon O
the O
dry O
land O
; O
' O
when O
the O
word O
of O
the O
Lord O
came O
a O
second O
time O
; O
and O
Jonah O
, O
bruised O
and O
beaten—his O
ears O
, O
like O
two O
sea-shells O
, O
still O
multitudinously O
murmuring O
of O
the O
ocean—Jonah O
did O
the O
Almighty O
's O
bidding O
. O
And O
what O
was O
that O
, O
shipmates O

To O
preach O
the O
Truth O

the O
face O
of O
Falsehood O

the O
great O
Pilot O
Paul O
has O
it O
, O
while O
preaching O
to O

is O
himself O
a O
castaway O
! O
" O
He O
dropped O
and O
fell O
away O
from O
himself O
for O
a O
moment O
; O
then O
lifting O
his O
face O
to O
them O
again O
, O
showed O
a O
deep O
joy O
in O
his O
eyes O

as O
he O
cried O
out O
with O
a O
heavenly O
enthusiasm O

But O
oh O
! O
shipmates O
! O
on O
the O
starboard O
hand O
of O
every O
woe O
, O
there O
is O
a O
sure O
delight O
; O

higher O
the O
top O
of O
that O
delight O

than O
the O
bottom O

Is O
not O
the O
main-truck O
higher O
than O
the O
kelson O

low O

Delight O
is O
to O

far O

far O
upward O

inward O
delight—who O
against O

proud O
