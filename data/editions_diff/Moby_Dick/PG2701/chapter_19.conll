" O
Shipmates O
, O
have O
ye O
shipped O
in O
that O
ship O
? O
" O
Queequeg O
and O
I O
had O
just O
left O
the O
Pequod O
, O
and O
were O
sauntering O
away O
from O
the O
water O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
each O
occupied O
with O
his O
own O
thoughts O
, O
when O
the O
above O
words O
were O
put O
to O
us O
by O
a O
stranger O
, O
who O
, O
pausing O
before O
us O
, O
levelled O
his O
massive O
forefinger O
at O
the O
vessel O
in O
question O
. O
He O
was O
but O
shabbily O
apparelled O
in O
faded O
jacket O
and O
patched O
trowsers O
; O
a O
rag O
of O
a O
black O
handkerchief O
investing O
his O
neck O
. O
A O
confluent O
small-pox O
had O
in O
all O
directions O
flowed O
over O
his O
face O
, O
and O
left O
it O
like O
the O
complicated O
ribbed O
bed O
of O
a O
torrent O
, O
when O
the O
rushing O
waters O
have O
been O
dried O
up O
. O
" O
Have O
ye O
shipped O
in O
her O
? O
" O
he O
repeated O
. O
" O
You O
mean O
the O
ship O
Pequod O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
trying O
to O
gain O
a O
little O
more O
time O
for O
an O
uninterrupted O
look O
at O
him O
. O
" O
Aye O
, O
the O
Pequod—that O
ship O
there O
, O
" O
he O
said O
, O
drawing O
back O
his O
whole O
arm O
, O
and O
then O
rapidly O
shoving O
it O
straight O
out O
from O
him O
, O
with O
the O
fixed O
bayonet O
of O
his O
pointed O
finger O
darted O
full O
at O
the O
object O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
we O
have O
just O
signed O
the O
articles O
. O
" O
" O
Anything O
down O
there O
about O
your O
souls O
? O
" O
" O
About O
what O
? O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
perhaps O
you O
hav'n't O
got O
any O
, O
" O
he O
said O
quickly O
. O
" O
No O
matter O
though O
, O
I O
know O
many O
chaps O
that O
hav'n't O
got O
any O
, O
—good O
luck O
to O
'em O
; O
and O
they O
are O
all O
the O
better O
off O
for O
it O
. O
A O
soul O
's O
a O
sort O
of O
a O
fifth O
wheel O
to O
a O
wagon O
. O
" O
" O
What O
are O
you O
jabbering O
about O
, O
shipmate O
? O
" O
said O
I O
. O
" O
_He's_ O
got O
enough O
, O
though O
, O
to O
make O
up O
for O
all O
deficiencies O
of O
that O
sort O
in O
other O
chaps O
, O
" O
abruptly O
said O
the O
stranger O
, O
placing O
a O
nervous O
emphasis O
upon O
the O
word O
_he_ O
. O
" O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
let O
's O
go O
; O
this O
fellow O
has O
broken O
loose O
from O
somewhere O
; O
he O
's O
talking O
about O
something O
and O
somebody O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
. O
" O
" O
Stop O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
stranger O
. O
" O
Ye O
said O
true—ye O
hav'n't O
seen O
Old O
Thunder O
yet O
, O
have O
ye O
? O
" O
" O
Who O
's O
Old O
Thunder O
? O
" O
said O
I O
, O
again O
riveted O
with O
the O
insane O
earnestness O
of O
his O
manner O
. O
" O
Captain O
Ahab O
. O
" O
" O
What O
! O
the O
captain O
of O
our O
ship O
, O
the O
Pequod O
? O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
among O
some O
of O
us O
old O
sailor O
chaps O
, O
he O
goes O
by O
that O
name O
. O
Ye O
hav'n't O
seen O
him O
yet O
, O
have O
ye O
? O
" O
" O
No O
, O
we O
hav'n't O
. O
He O
's O
sick O
they O
say O
, O
but O
is O
getting O
better O
, O
and O
will O
be O
all O
right O
again O
before O
long O
. O
" O
" O
All O
right O
again O
before O
long O
! O
" O
laughed O
the O
stranger O
, O
with O
a O
solemnly O
derisive O
sort O
of O
laugh O
. O
" O
Look O
ye O
; O
when O
Captain O
Ahab O
is O
all O
right O
, O
then O
this O
left O
arm O
of O
mine O
will O
be O
all O
right O
; O
not O
before O
. O
" O
" O
What O
do O
you O
know O
about O
him O
? O
" O
" O
What O
did O
they O
_tell_ O
you O
about O
him O
? O
Say O
that O
! O
" O
" O
They O
did O
n't O
tell O
much O
of O
anything O
about O
him O
; O
only O
I O
've O
heard O
that O
he O
's O
a O
good O
whale-hunter O
, O
and O
a O
good O
captain O
to O
his O
crew O
. O
" O
" O
That O
's O
true O
, O
that O
's O
true—yes O
, O
both O
true O
enough O
. O
But O
you O
must O
jump O
when O
he O
gives O
an O
order O
. O
Step O
and O
growl O
; O
growl O
and O
go—that O
's O
the O
word O
with O
Captain O
Ahab O
. O
But O
nothing O
about O
that O
thing O
that O
happened O
to O
him O
off O
Cape O
Horn O
, O
long O
ago O
, O
when O
he O
lay O
like O
dead O
for O
three O
days O
and O
nights O
; O
nothing O
about O
that O
deadly O
skrimmage O
with O
the O
Spaniard O
afore O
the O
altar O
in O
Santa O
? O
—heard O
nothing O
about O
that O
, O
eh O
? O
Nothing O
about O
the O
silver O
calabash O
he O
spat O
into O
? O
And O
nothing O
about O
his O
losing O
his O
leg O
last O
voyage O
, O
according O
to O
the O
prophecy O
. O
Did O
n't O
ye O
hear O
a O
word O
about O
them O
matters O
and O
something O
more O
, O
eh O
? O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
ye O
did O
; O
how O
could O
ye O
? O
Who O
knows O
it O
? O
Not O
all O
Nantucket O
, O
I O
guess O
. O
But O
hows'ever O
, O
mayhap O
, O
ye O
've O
heard O
tell O
about O
the O
leg O
, O
and O
how O
he O
lost O
it O
; O
aye O
, O
ye O
have O
heard O
of O
that O
, O
I O
dare O
say O
. O
Oh O
yes O
, O
_that_ O
every O
one O
knows O
a'most—I O
mean O
they O
know O
he O
's O
only O
one O
leg O
; O
and O
that O
a O
parmacetti O
took O
the O
other O
off O
. O
" O
" O
My O
friend O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
what O
all O
this O
gibberish O
of O
yours O
is O
about O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
much O
care O
; O
for O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
you O
must O
be O
a O
little O
damaged O
in O
the O
head O
. O
But O
if O
you O
are O
speaking O
of O
Captain O
Ahab O
, O
of O
that O
ship O
there O
, O
the O
Pequod O
, O
then O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
, O
that O
I O
know O
all O
about O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
leg O
. O
" O
" O
_All_ O
about O
it O
, O
eh—sure O
you O
do O
? O
—all O
? O
" O
" O
Pretty O
sure O
. O
" O
With O
finger O
pointed O
and O
eye O
levelled O
at O
the O
Pequod O
, O
the O
beggar-like O
stranger O
stood O
a O
moment O
, O
as O
if O
in O
a O
troubled O
reverie O
; O
then O
starting O
a O
little O
, O
turned O
and O
said O
: O
— O
" O
Ye O
've O
shipped O
, O
have O
ye O
? O
Names O
down O
on O
the O
papers O
? O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
what O
's O
signed O
, O
is O
signed O
; O
and O
what O
's O
to O
be O
, O
will O
be O
; O
and O
then O
again O
, O
perhaps O
it O
wo O
n't O
be O
, O
after O
all O
. O
Anyhow O
, O
it O
's O
all O
fixed O
and O
arranged O
a'ready O
; O
and O
some O
sailors O
or O
other O
must O
go O
with O
him O
, O
I O
suppose O
; O
as O
well O
these O
as O
any O
other O
men O
, O
God O
pity O
'em O
! O
Morning O
to O
ye O
, O
shipmates O
, O
morning O
; O
the O
ineffable O
heavens O
bless O
ye O
; O
I O
'm O
sorry O
I O
stopped O
ye O
. O
" O
" O
Look O
here O
, O
friend O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
if O
you O
have O
anything O
important O
to O
tell O
us O
, O
out O
with O
it O
; O
but O
if O
you O
are O
only O
trying O
to O
bamboozle O
us O
, O
you O
are O
mistaken O
in O
your O
game O
; O
that O
's O
all O
I O
have O
to O
say O
. O
" O
" O
And O
it O
's O
said O
very O
well O
, O
and O
I O
like O
to O
hear O
a O
chap O
talk O
up O
that O
way O
; O
you O
are O
just O
the O
man O
for O
him—the O
likes O
of O
ye O
. O
Morning O
to O
ye O
, O
shipmates O
, O
morning O
! O
Oh O
! O
when O
ye O
get O
there O
, O
tell O
'em O
I O
've O
concluded O
not O
to O
make O
one O
of O
'em O
. O
" O
" O
Ah O
, O
my O
dear O
fellow O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
fool O
us O
that O
way—you O
ca O
n't O
fool O
us O
. O
It O
is O
the O
easiest O
thing O
in O
the O
world O
for O
a O
man O
to O
look O
as O
if O
he O
had O
a O
great O
secret O
in O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Morning O
to O
ye O
, O
shipmates O
, O
morning O
. O
" O
" O
Morning O
it O
is O
, O
" O
said O
I O
. O
" O
Come O
along O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
let O
's O
leave O
this O
crazy O
man O
. O
But O
stop O
, O
tell O
me O
your O
name O
, O
will O
you O
? O
" O
" O
Elijah O
. O
" O
Elijah O
! O
thought O
I O
, O
and O
we O
walked O
away O
, O
both O
commenting O
, O
after O
each O
other O
's O
fashion O
, O
upon O
this O
ragged O
old O
sailor O
; O
and O
agreed O
that O
he O
was O
nothing O
but O
a O
humbug O
, O
trying O
to O
be O
a O
bugbear O
. O
But O
we O
had O
not O
gone O
perhaps O
above O
a O
hundred O
yards O
, O
when O
chancing O
to O
turn O
a O
corner O
, O
and O
looking O
back O
as O
I O
did O
so O
, O
who O
should O
be O
seen O
but O
Elijah O
following O
us O
, O
though O
at O
a O
distance O
. O
Somehow O
, O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
struck O
me O
so O
, O
that O
I O
said O
nothing O
to O
Queequeg O
of O
his O
being O
behind O
, O
but O
passed O
on O
with O
my O
comrade O
, O
anxious O
to O
see O
whether O
the O
stranger O
would O
turn O
the O
same O
corner O
that O
we O
did O
. O
He O
did O
; O
and O
then O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
that O
he O
was O
dogging O
us O
, O
but O
with O
what O
intent O
I O
could O
not O
for O
the O
life O
of O
me O
imagine O
. O
This O
circumstance O
, O
coupled O
with O
his O
ambiguous O
, O
half-hinting O
, O
half-revealing O
, O
shrouded O
sort O
of O
talk O
, O
now O
begat O
in O
me O
all O
kinds O
of O
vague O
wonderments O
and O
half-apprehensions O
, O
and O
all O
connected O
with O
the O
Pequod O
; O
and O
Captain O
Ahab O
; O
and O
the O
leg O
he O
had O
lost O
; O
and O
the O
Cape O
Horn O
fit O
; O
and O
the O
silver O
calabash O
; O
and O
what O
Captain O
Peleg O
had O
said O
of O
him O
, O
when O
I O
left O
the O
ship O
the O
day O
previous O
; O
and O
the O
prediction O
of O
the O
squaw O
Tistig O
; O
and O
the O
voyage O
we O
had O
bound O
ourselves O
to O
sail O
; O
and O
a O
hundred O
other O
shadowy O
things O
. O
I O
was O
resolved O
to O
satisfy O
myself O
whether O
this O
ragged O
Elijah O
was O
really O
dogging O
us O
or O
not O
, O
and O
with O
that O
intent O
crossed O
the O
way O
with O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
on O
that O
side O
of O
it O
retraced O
our O
steps O
. O
But O
Elijah O
passed O
on O
, O
without O
seeming O
to O
notice O
us O
. O
This O
relieved O
me O
; O
and O
once O
more O
, O
and O
finally O
as O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
, O
I O
pronounced O
him O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
a O
humbug O
. O
