According O
to O
usage O
they O
were O
pumping O
the O
ship O
next O
morning O
; O
and O
lo O
! O
no O
inconsiderable O
oil O
came O
up O
with O
the O
water O
; O
the O
casks O
below O
must O
have O
sprung O
a O
bad O
leak O
. O
Much O
concern O
was O
shown O
; O
and O
Starbuck O
went O
down O
into O
the O
cabin O
to O
report O
this O
unfavourable O
affair O
. O
* O
* O
In O
Sperm-whalemen O
with O
any O
considerable O
quantity O
of O
oil O
on O
board O
, O
it O
is O
a O
regular O
semi-weekly O
duty O
to O
conduct O
a O
hose O
into O
the O
hold O
, O
and O
drench O
the O
casks O
with O
sea-water O
; O
which O
afterwards O
, O
at O
varying O
intervals O
, O
is O
removed O
by O
the O
ship O
's O
pumps O
. O
Hereby O
the O
casks O
are O
sought O
to O
be O
kept O
damply O
tight O
; O
while O
by O
the O
changed O
character O
of O
the O
withdrawn O
water O
, O
the O
mariners O
readily O
detect O
any O
serious O
leakage O
in O
the O
precious O
cargo O
. O
Now O
, O
from O
the O
South O
and O
West O
the O
Pequod O
was O
drawing O
nigh O
to O
Formosa O
and O
the O
Bashee O
Isles O
, O
between O
which O
lies O
one O
of O
the O
tropical O
outlets O
from O
the O
China O
waters O
into O
the O
Pacific O
. O
And O
so O
Starbuck O
found O
Ahab O
with O
a O
general O
chart O
of O
the O
oriental O
archipelagoes O
spread O
before O
him O
; O
and O
another O
separate O
one O
representing O
the O
long O
eastern O
coasts O
of O
the O
Japanese O
islands—Niphon O
, O
Matsmai O
, O
and O
Sikoke O
. O
With O
his O
snow-white O
new O
ivory O
leg O
braced O
against O
the O
screwed O
leg O
of O
his O
table O
, O
and O
with O
a O
long O
pruning-hook O
of O
a O
jack-knife O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
the O
wondrous O
old O
man O
, O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
gangway O
door O
, O
was O
wrinkling O
his O
brow O
, O
and O
tracing O
his O
old O
courses O
again O
. O
" O
Who O
's O
there O
? O
" O
hearing O
the O
footstep O
at O
the O
door O
, O
but O
not O
turning O
round O
to O
it O
. O
" O
On O
deck O
! O
Begone O
! O
" O
" O
Captain O
Ahab O
mistakes O
; O
it O
is O
I O
. O
The O
oil O
in O
the O
hold O
is O
leaking O
, O
sir O
. O
We O
must O
up O
Burtons O
and O
break O
out O
. O
" O
" O
Up O
Burtons O
and O
break O
out O
? O
Now O
that O
we O
are O
nearing O
Japan O
; O
heave-to O
here O
for O
a O
week O
to O
tinker O
a O
parcel O
of O
old O
hoops O
? O
" O
" O
Either O
do O
that O
, O
sir O
, O
or O
waste O
in O
one O
day O
more O
oil O
than O
we O
may O
make O
good O
in O
a O
year O
. O
What O
we O
come O
twenty O
thousand O
miles O
to O
get O
is O
worth O
saving O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
So O
it O
is O
, O
so O
it O
is O
; O
if O
we O
get O
it O
. O
" O
" O
I O
was O
speaking O
of O
the O
oil O
in O
the O
hold O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
And O
I O
was O
not O
speaking O
or O
thinking O
of O
that O
at O
all O
. O
Begone O
! O
Let O
it O
leak O
! O
I O
'm O
all O
aleak O
myself O
. O
Aye O
! O
leaks O
in O
leaks O
! O
not O
only O
full O
of O
leaky O
casks O
, O
but O
those O
leaky O
casks O
are O
in O
a O
leaky O
ship O
; O
and O
that O
's O
a O
far O
worse O
plight O
than O
the O
Pequod O
's O
, O
man O
. O
Yet O
I O
do O
n't O
stop O
to O
plug O
my O
leak O
; O
for O
who O
can O
find O
it O
in O
the O
deep-loaded O
hull O
; O
or O
how O
hope O
to O
plug O
it O
, O
even O
if O
found O
, O
in O
this O
life O
's O
howling O
gale O
? O
Starbuck O
! O
I O
'll O
not O
have O
the O
Burtons O
hoisted O
. O
" O
" O
What O
will O
the O
owners O
say O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
" O
Let O
the O
owners O
stand O
on O
Nantucket O
beach O
and O
outyell O
the O
Typhoons O
. O
What O
cares O
Ahab O
? O
Owners O
, O
owners O
? O
Thou O
art O
always O
prating O
to O
me O
, O
Starbuck O
, O
about O
those O
miserly O
owners O
, O
as O
if O
the O
owners O
were O
my O
conscience O
. O
But O
look O
ye O
, O
the O
only O
real O
owner O
of O
anything O
is O
its O
commander O
; O
and O
hark O
ye O
, O
my O
conscience O
is O
in O
this O
ship O
's O
keel.—On O
deck O
! O
" O
" O
Captain O
Ahab O
, O
" O
said O
the O
reddening O
mate O
, O
moving O
further O
into O
the O
cabin O
, O
with O
a O
daring O
so O
strangely O
respectful O
and O
cautious O
that O
it O
almost O
seemed O
not O
only O
every O
way O
seeking O
to O
avoid O
the O
slightest O
outward O
manifestation O
of O
itself O
, O
but O
within O
also O
seemed O
more O
than O
half O
distrustful O
of O
itself O
; O
" O
A O
better O
man O
than O
I O
might O
well O
pass O
over O
in O
thee O
what O
he O
would O
quickly O
enough O
resent O
in O
a O
younger O
man O
; O
aye O
, O
and O
in O
a O
happier O
, O
Captain O
Ahab O
. O
" O
" O
Devils O
! O
Dost O
thou O
then O
so O
much O
as O
dare O
to O
critically O
think O
of O
me O
? O
—On O
deck O
! O
" O
" O
Nay O
, O
sir O
, O
not O
yet O
; O
I O
do O
entreat O
. O
And O
I O
do O
dare O
, O
sir—to O
be O
forbearing O
! O
Shall O
we O
not O
understand O
each O
other O
better O
than O
hitherto O
, O
Captain O
Ahab O
? O
" O
Ahab O
seized O
a O
loaded O
musket O
from O
the O
rack O
( O
forming O
part O
of O
most O
South-Sea-men O
's O
cabin O
furniture O
) O
, O
and O
pointing O
it O
towards O
Starbuck O
, O
exclaimed O
: O
" O
There O
is O
one O
God O
that O
is O
Lord O
over O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
one O
Captain O
that O
is O
lord O
over O
the O
Pequod.—On O
deck O
! O
" O
For O
an O
instant O
in O
the O
flashing O
eyes O
of O
the O
mate O
, O
and O
his O
fiery O
cheeks O
, O
you O
would O
have O
almost O
thought O
that O
he O
had O
really O
received O
the O
blaze O
of O
the O
levelled O
tube O
. O
But O
, O
mastering O
his O
emotion O
, O
he O
half O
calmly O
rose O
, O
and O
as O
he O
quitted O
the O
cabin O
, O
paused O
for O
an O
instant O
and O
said O
: O
" O
Thou O
hast O
outraged O
, O
not O
insulted O
me O
, O
sir O
; O
but O
for O
that O
I O
ask O
thee O
not O
to O
beware O
of O
Starbuck O
; O
thou O
wouldst O
but O
laugh O
; O
but O
let O
Ahab O
beware O
of O
Ahab O
; O
beware O
of O
thyself O
, O
old O
man O
. O
" O
" O
He O
waxes O
brave O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
obeys O
; O
most O
careful O
bravery O
that O
! O
" O
murmured O
Ahab O
, O
as O
Starbuck O
disappeared O
. O
" O
What O
's O
that O
he O
said—Ahab O
beware O
of O
Ahab—there O
's O
something O
there O
! O
" O
Then O
unconsciously O
using O
the O
musket O
for O
a O
staff O
, O
with O
an O
iron O
brow O
he O
paced O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
little O
cabin O
; O
but O
presently O
the O
thick O
plaits O
of O
his O
forehead O
relaxed O
, O
and O
returning O
the O
gun O
to O
the O
rack O
, O
he O
went O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
" O
Thou O
art O
but O
too O
good O
a O
fellow O
, O
Starbuck O
, O
" O
he O
said O
lowly O
to O
the O
mate O
; O
then O
raising O
his O
voice O
to O
the O
crew O
: O
" O
Furl O
the O
t'gallant-sails O
, O
and O
close-reef O
the O
top-sails O
, O
fore O
and O
aft O
; O
back O
the O
main-yard O
; O
up O
Burton O
, O
and O
break O
out O
in O
the O
main-hold O
. O
" O
It O
were O
perhaps O
vain O
to O
surmise O
exactly O
why O
it O
was O
, O
that O
as O
respecting O
Starbuck O
, O
Ahab O
thus O
acted O
. O
It O
may O
have O
been O
a O
flash O
of O
honesty O
in O
him O
; O
or O
mere O
prudential O
policy O
which O
, O
under O
the O
circumstance O
, O
imperiously O
forbade O
the O
slightest O
symptom O
of O
open O
disaffection O
, O
however O
transient O
, O
in O
the O
important O
chief O
officer O
of O
his O
ship O
. O
However O
it O
was O
, O
his O
orders O
were O
executed O
; O
and O
the O
Burtons O
were O
hoisted O
. O
