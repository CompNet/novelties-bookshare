Out O
of O
the O
trunk O
, O
the O
branches O
grow O
; O
out O
of O
them O
, O
the O
twigs O
. O
So O
, O
in O
productive O
subjects O
, O
grow O
the O
chapters O
. O
The O
crotch O
alluded O
to O
on O
a O
previous O
page O
deserves O
independent O
mention O
. O
It O
is O
a O
notched O
stick O
of O
a O
peculiar O
form O
, O
some O
two O
feet O
in O
length O
, O
which O
is O
perpendicularly O
inserted O
into O
the O
starboard O
gunwale O
near O
the O
bow O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
furnishing O
a O
rest O
for O
the O
wooden O
extremity O
of O
the O
harpoon O
, O
whose O
other O
naked O
, O
barbed O
end O
slopingly O
projects O
from O
the O
prow O
. O
Thereby O
the O
weapon O
is O
instantly O
at O
hand O
to O
its O
hurler O
, O
who O
snatches O
it O
up O
as O
readily O
from O
its O
rest O
as O
a O
backwoodsman O
swings O
his O
rifle O
from O
the O
wall O
. O
It O
is O
customary O
to O
have O
two O
harpoons O
reposing O
in O
the O
crotch O
, O
respectively O
called O
the O
first O
and O
second O
irons O
. O
But O
these O
two O
harpoons O
, O
each O
by O
its O
own O
cord O
, O
are O
both O
connected O
with O
the O
line O
; O
the O
object O
being O
this O
: O
to O
dart O
them O
both O
, O
if O
possible O
, O
one O
instantly O
after O
the O
other O
into O
the O
same O
whale O
; O
so O
that O
if O
, O
in O
the O
coming O
drag O
, O
one O
should O
draw O
out O
, O
the O
other O
may O
still O
retain O
a O
hold O
. O
It O
is O
a O
doubling O
of O
the O
chances O
. O
But O
it O
very O
often O
happens O
that O
owing O
to O
the O
instantaneous O
, O
violent O
, O
convulsive O
running O
of O
the O
whale O
upon O
receiving O
the O
first O
iron O
, O
it O
becomes O
impossible O
for O
the O
harpooneer O
, O
however O
lightning-like O
in O
his O
movements O
, O
to O
pitch O
the O
second O
iron O
into O
him O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
as O
the O
second O
iron O
is O
already O
connected O
with O
the O
line O
, O
and O
the O
line O
is O
running O
, O
hence O
that O
weapon O
must O
, O
at O
all O
events O
, O
be O
anticipatingly O
tossed O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
somehow O
and O
somewhere O
; O
else O
the O
most O
terrible O
jeopardy O
would O
involve O
all O
hands O
. O
Tumbled O
into O
the O
water O
, O
it O
accordingly O
is O
in O
such O
cases O
; O
the O
spare O
coils O
of O
box O
line O
( O
mentioned O
in O
a O
preceding O
chapter O
) O
making O
this O
feat O
, O
in O
most O
instances O
, O
prudently O
practicable O
. O
But O
this O
critical O
act O
is O
not O
always O
unattended O
with O
the O
saddest O
and O
most O
fatal O
casualties O
. O
Furthermore O
: O
you O
must O
know O
that O
when O
the O
second O
iron O
is O
thrown O
overboard O
, O
it O
thenceforth O
becomes O
a O
dangling O
, O
sharp-edged O
terror O
, O
skittishly O
curvetting O
about O
both O
boat O
and O
whale O
, O
entangling O
the O
lines O
, O
or O
cutting O
them O
, O
and O
making O
a O
prodigious O
sensation O
in O
all O
directions O
. O
Nor O
, O
in O
general O
, O
is O
it O
possible O
to O
secure O
it O
again O
until O
the O
whale O
is O
fairly O
captured O
and O
a O
corpse O
. O
Consider O
, O
now O
, O
how O
it O
must O
be O
in O
the O
case O
of O
four O
boats O
all O
engaging O
one O
unusually O
strong O
, O
active O
, O
and O
knowing O
whale O
; O
when O
owing O
to O
these O
qualities O
in O
him O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
the O
thousand O
concurring O
accidents O
of O
such O
an O
audacious O
enterprise O
, O
eight O
or O
ten O
loose O
second O
irons O
may O
be O
simultaneously O
dangling O
about O
him O
. O
For O
, O
of O
course O
, O
each O
boat O
is O
supplied O
with O
several O
harpoons O
to O
bend O
on O
to O
the O
line O
should O
the O
first O
one O
be O
ineffectually O
darted O
without O
recovery O
. O
All O
these O
particulars O
are O
faithfully O
narrated O
here O
, O
as O
they O
will O
not O
fail O
to O
elucidate O
several O
most O
important O
, O
however O
intricate O
passages O
, O
in O
scenes O
hereafter O
to O
be O
painted O
