The O
Pequod O
, O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
Meets O
the O
Samuel O
Enderby O
, O
of O
London O
. O
" O
Ship O
, O
ahoy O
! O
Hast O
seen O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
So O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
once O
more O
hailing O
a O
ship O
showing O
English O
colours O
, O
bearing O
down O
under O
the O
stern O
. O
Trumpet O
to O
mouth O
, O
the O
old O
man O
was O
standing O
in O
his O
hoisted O
quarter-boat O
, O
his O
ivory O
leg O
plainly O
revealed O
to O
the O
stranger O
captain O
, O
who O
was O
carelessly O
reclining O
in O
his O
own O
boat O
's O
bow O
. O
He O
was O
a O
darkly-tanned O
, O
burly O
, O
good-natured O
, O
fine-looking O
man O
, O
of O
sixty O
or O
thereabouts O
, O
dressed O
in O
a O
spacious O
roundabout O
, O
that O
hung O
round O
him O
in O
festoons O
of O
blue O
pilot-cloth O
; O
and O
one O
empty O
arm O
of O
this O
jacket O
streamed O
behind O
him O
like O
the O
broidered O
arm O
of O
a O
hussar O
's O
surcoat O
. O
" O
Hast O
seen O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
" O
See O
you O
this O
? O
" O
and O
withdrawing O
it O
from O
the O
folds O
that O
had O
hidden O
it O
, O
he O
held O
up O
a O
white O
arm O
of O
sperm O
whale O
bone O
, O
terminating O
in O
a O
wooden O
head O
like O
a O
mallet O
. O
" O
Man O
my O
boat O
! O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
impetuously O
, O
and O
tossing O
about O
the O
oars O
near O
him— O
" O
Stand O
by O
to O
lower O
! O
" O
In O
less O
than O
a O
minute O
, O
without O
quitting O
his O
little O
craft O
, O
he O
and O
his O
crew O
were O
dropped O
to O
the O
water O
, O
and O
were O
soon O
alongside O
of O
the O
stranger O
. O
But O
here O
a O
curious O
difficulty O
presented O
itself O
. O
In O
the O
excitement O
of O
the O
moment O
, O
Ahab O
had O
forgotten O
that O
since O
the O
loss O
of O
his O
leg O
he O
had O
never O
once O
stepped O
on O
board O
of O
any O
vessel O
at O
sea O
but O
his O
own O
, O
and O
then O
it O
was O
always O
by O
an O
ingenious O
and O
very O
handy O
mechanical O
contrivance O
peculiar O
to O
the O
Pequod O
, O
and O
a O
thing O
not O
to O
be O
rigged O
and O
shipped O
in O
any O
other O
vessel O
at O
a O
moment O
's O
warning O
. O
Now O
, O
it O
is O
no O
very O
easy O
matter O
for O
anybody—except O
those O
who O
are O
almost O
hourly O
used O
to O
it O
, O
like O
whalemen—to O
clamber O
up O
a O
ship O
's O
side O
from O
a O
boat O
on O
the O
open O
sea O
; O
for O
the O
great O
swells O
now O
lift O
the O
boat O
high O
up O
towards O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
then O
instantaneously O
drop O
it O
half O
way O
down O
to O
the O
kelson O
. O
So O
, O
deprived O
of O
one O
leg O
, O
and O
the O
strange O
ship O
of O
course O
being O
altogether O
unsupplied O
with O
the O
kindly O
invention O
, O
Ahab O
now O
found O
himself O
abjectly O
reduced O
to O
a O
clumsy O
landsman O
again O
; O
hopelessly O
eyeing O
the O
uncertain O
changeful O
height O
he O
could O
hardly O
hope O
to O
attain O
. O
It O
has O
before O
been O
hinted O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
every O
little O
untoward O
circumstance O
that O
befell O
him O
, O
and O
which O
indirectly O
sprang O
from O
his O
luckless O
mishap O
, O
almost O
invariably O
irritated O
or O
exasperated O
Ahab O
. O
And O
in O
the O
present O
instance O
, O
all O
this O
was O
heightened O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
two O
officers O
of O
the O
strange O
ship O
, O
leaning O
over O
the O
side O
, O
by O
the O
perpendicular O
ladder O
of O
nailed O
cleets O
there O
, O
and O
swinging O
towards O
him O
a O
pair O
of O
tastefully-ornamented O
man-ropes O
; O
for O
at O
first O
they O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
bethink O
them O
that O
a O
one-legged O
man O
must O
be O
too O
much O
of O
a O
cripple O
to O
use O
their O
sea O
bannisters O
. O
But O
this O
awkwardness O
only O
lasted O
a O
minute O
, O
because O
the O
strange O
captain O
, O
observing O
at O
a O
glance O
how O
affairs O
stood O
, O
cried O
out O
, O
" O
I O
see O
, O
I O
see O
! O
—avast O
heaving O
there O
! O
Jump O
, O
boys O
, O
and O
swing O
over O
the O
cutting-tackle O
. O
" O
As O
good O
luck O
would O
have O
it O
, O
they O
had O
had O
a O
whale O
alongside O
a O
day O
or O
two O
previous O
, O
and O
the O
great O
tackles O
were O
still O
aloft O
, O
and O
the O
massive O
curved O
blubber-hook O
, O
now O
clean O
and O
dry O
, O
was O
still O
attached O
to O
the O
end O
. O
This O
was O
quickly O
lowered O
to O
Ahab O
, O
who O
at O
once O
comprehending O
it O
all O
, O
slid O
his O
solitary O
thigh O
into O
the O
curve O
of O
the O
hook O
( O
it O
was O
like O
sitting O
in O
the O
fluke O
of O
an O
anchor O
, O
or O
the O
crotch O
of O
an O
apple O
tree O
) O
, O
and O
then O
giving O
the O
word O
, O
held O
himself O
fast O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
also O
helped O
to O
hoist O
his O
own O
weight O
, O
by O
pulling O
hand-over-hand O
upon O
one O
of O
the O
running O
parts O
of O
the O
tackle O
. O
Soon O
he O
was O
carefully O
swung O
inside O
the O
high O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
gently O
landed O
upon O
the O
capstan O
head O
. O
With O
his O
ivory O
arm O
frankly O
thrust O
forth O
in O
welcome O
, O
the O
other O
captain O
advanced O
, O
and O
Ahab O
, O
putting O
out O
his O
ivory O
leg O
, O
and O
crossing O
the O
ivory O
arm O
( O
like O
two O
sword-fish O
blades O
) O
cried O
out O
in O
his O
walrus O
way O
, O
" O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
hearty O
! O
let O
us O
shake O
bones O
together O
! O
—an O
arm O
and O
a O
leg O
! O
—an O
arm O
that O
never O
can O
shrink O
, O
d O
'ye O
see O
; O
and O
a O
leg O
that O
never O
can O
run O
. O
Where O
did'st O
thou O
see O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
—how O
long O
ago O
? O
" O
" O
The O
White O
Whale O
, O
" O
said O
the O
Englishman O
, O
pointing O
his O
ivory O
arm O
towards O
the O
East O
, O
and O
taking O
a O
rueful O
sight O
along O
it O
, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
a O
telescope O
; O
" O
there O
I O
saw O
him O
, O
on O
the O
Line O
, O
last O
season O
. O
" O
" O
And O
he O
took O
that O
arm O
off O
, O
did O
he O
? O
" O
asked O
Ahab O
, O
now O
sliding O
down O
from O
the O
capstan O
, O
and O
resting O
on O
the O
Englishman O
's O
shoulder O
, O
as O
he O
did O
so O
. O
" O
Aye O
, O
he O
was O
the O
cause O
of O
it O
, O
at O
least O
; O
and O
that O
leg O
, O
too O
? O
" O
" O
Spin O
me O
the O
yarn O
, O
" O
said O
Ahab O
; O
" O
how O
was O
it O
? O
" O
" O
It O
was O
the O
first O
time O
in O
my O
life O
that O
I O
ever O
cruised O
on O
the O
Line O
, O
" O
began O
the O
Englishman O
. O
" O
I O
was O
ignorant O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
at O
that O
time O
. O
Well O
, O
one O
day O
we O
lowered O
for O
a O
pod O
of O
four O
or O
five O
whales O
, O
and O
my O
boat O
fastened O
to O
one O
of O
them O
; O
a O
regular O
circus O
horse O
he O
was O
, O
too O
, O
that O
went O
milling O
and O
milling O
round O
so O
, O
that O
my O
boat O
's O
crew O
could O
only O
trim O
dish O
, O
by O
sitting O
all O
their O
sterns O
on O
the O
outer O
gunwale O
. O
Presently O
up O
breaches O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
a O
bouncing O
great O
whale O
, O
with O
a O
milky-white O
head O
and O
hump O
, O
all O
crows O
' O
feet O
and O
wrinkles O
. O
" O
" O
It O
was O
he O
, O
it O
was O
he O
! O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
suddenly O
letting O
out O
his O
suspended O
breath O
. O
" O
And O
harpoons O
sticking O
in O
near O
his O
starboard O
fin O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
aye—they O
were O
mine—_my_ O
irons O
, O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
exultingly— O
" O
but O
on O
! O
" O
" O
Give O
me O
a O
chance O
, O
then O
, O
" O
said O
the O
Englishman O
, O
good-humoredly O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
this O
old O
great-grandfather O
, O
with O
the O
white O
head O
and O
hump O
, O
runs O
all O
afoam O
into O
the O
pod O
, O
and O
goes O
to O
snapping O
furiously O
at O
my O
fast-line O
! O
" O
Aye O
, O
I O
see O
! O
—wanted O
to O
part O
it O
; O
free O
the O
fast-fish—an O
old O
trick—I O
know O
him O
. O
" O
" O
How O
it O
was O
exactly O
, O
" O
continued O
the O
one-armed O
commander O
, O
" O
I O
do O
not O
know O
; O
but O
in O
biting O
the O
line O
, O
it O
got O
foul O
of O
his O
teeth O
, O
caught O
there O
somehow O
; O
but O
we O
did O
n't O
know O
it O
then O
; O
so O
that O
when O
we O
afterwards O
pulled O
on O
the O
line O
, O
bounce O
we O
came O
plump O
on O
to O
his O
hump O
! O
instead O
of O
the O
other O
whale O
's O
; O
that O
went O
off O
to O
windward O
, O
all O
fluking O
. O
Seeing O
how O
matters O
stood O
, O
and O
what O
a O
noble O
great O
whale O
it O
was—the O
noblest O
and O
biggest O
I O
ever O
saw O
, O
sir O
, O
in O
my O
life—I O
resolved O
to O
capture O
him O
, O
spite O
of O
the O
boiling O
rage O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
in O
. O
And O
thinking O
the O
hap-hazard O
line O
would O
get O
loose O
, O
or O
the O
tooth O
it O
was O
tangled O
to O
might O
draw O
( O
for O
I O
have O
a O
devil O
of O
a O
boat O
's O
crew O
for O
a O
pull O
on O
a O
whale-line O
) O
; O
seeing O
all O
this O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
jumped O
into O
my O
first O
mate O
's O
boat—Mr O
. O
Mounttop O
's O
here O
( O
by O
the O
way O
, O
Captain—Mounttop O
; O
Mounttop—the O
captain O
) O
; O
—as O
I O
was O
saying O
, O
I O
jumped O
into O
Mounttop O
's O
boat O
, O
which O
, O
d O
'ye O
see O
, O
was O
gunwale O
and O
gunwale O
with O
mine O
, O
then O
; O
and O
snatching O
the O
first O
harpoon O
, O
let O
this O
old O
great-grandfather O
have O
it O
. O
But O
, O
Lord O
, O
look O
you O
, O
sir—hearts O
and O
souls O
alive O
, O
man—the O
next O
instant O
, O
in O
a O
jiff O
, O
I O
was O
blind O
as O
a O
bat—both O
eyes O
out—all O
befogged O
and O
bedeadened O
with O
black O
foam—the O
whale O
's O
tail O
looming O
straight O
up O
out O
of O
it O
, O
perpendicular O
in O
the O
air O
, O
like O
a O
marble O
steeple O
. O
No O
use O
sterning O
all O
, O
then O
; O
but O
as O
I O
was O
groping O
at O
midday O
, O
with O
a O
blinding O
sun O
, O
all O
crown-jewels O
; O
as O
I O
was O
groping O
, O
I O
say O
, O
after O
the O
second O
iron O
, O
to O
toss O
it O
overboard—down O
comes O
the O
tail O
like O
a O
Lima O
tower O
, O
cutting O
my O
boat O
in O
two O
, O
leaving O
each O
half O
in O
splinters O
; O
and O
, O
flukes O
first O
, O
the O
white O
hump O
backed O
through O
the O
wreck O
, O
as O
though O
it O
was O
all O
chips O
. O
We O
all O
struck O
out O
. O
To O
escape O
his O
terrible O
flailings O
, O
I O
seized O
hold O
of O
my O
harpoon-pole O
sticking O
in O
him O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
clung O
to O
that O
like O
a O
sucking O
fish O
. O
But O
a O
combing O
sea O
dashed O
me O
off O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
instant O
, O
the O
fish O
, O
taking O
one O
good O
dart O
forwards O
, O
went O
down O
like O
a O
flash O
; O
and O
the O
barb O
of O
that O
cursed O
second O
iron O
towing O
along O
near O
me O
caught O
me O
here O
" O
( O
clapping O
his O
hand O
just O
below O
his O
shoulder O
) O
; O
" O
yes O
, O
caught O
me O
just O
here O
, O
I O
say O
, O
and O
bore O
me O
down O
to O
Hell O
's O
flames O
, O
I O
was O
thinking O
; O
when O
, O
when O
, O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
, O
thank O
the O
good O
God O
, O
the O
barb O
ript O
its O
way O
along O
the O
flesh—clear O
along O
the O
whole O
length O
of O
my O
arm—came O
out O
nigh O
my O
wrist O
, O
and O
up O
I O
floated O
; O
—and O
that O
gentleman O
there O
will O
tell O
you O
the O
rest O
( O
by O
the O
way O
, O
captain—Dr O
. O
Bunger O
, O
ship O
's O
surgeon O
: O
Bunger O
, O
my O
lad O
, O
—the O
captain O
) O
. O
Now O
, O
Bunger O
boy O
, O
spin O
your O
part O
of O
the O
yarn O
. O
" O
The O
professional O
gentleman O
thus O
familiarly O
pointed O
out O
, O
had O
been O
all O
the O
time O
standing O
near O
them O
, O
with O
nothing O
specific O
visible O
, O
to O
denote O
his O
gentlemanly O
rank O
on O
board O
. O
His O
face O
was O
an O
exceedingly O
round O
but O
sober O
one O
; O
he O
was O
dressed O
in O
a O
faded O
blue O
woollen O
frock O
or O
shirt O
, O
and O
patched O
trowsers O
; O
and O
had O
thus O
far O
been O
dividing O
his O
attention O
between O
a O
marlingspike O
he O
held O
in O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
a O
pill-box O
held O
in O
the O
other O
, O
occasionally O
casting O
a O
critical O
glance O
at O
the O
ivory O
limbs O
of O
the O
two O
crippled O
captains O
. O
But O
, O
at O
his O
superior O
's O
introduction O
of O
him O
to O
Ahab O
, O
he O
politely O
bowed O
, O
and O
straightway O
went O
on O
to O
do O
his O
captain O
's O
bidding O
. O
" O
It O
was O
a O
shocking O
bad O
wound O
, O
" O
began O
the O
whale-surgeon O
; O
" O
and O
, O
taking O
my O
advice O
, O
Captain O
Boomer O
here O
, O
stood O
our O
old O
Sammy— O
" O
" O
Samuel O
Enderby O
is O
the O
name O
of O
my O
ship O
, O
" O
interrupted O
the O
one-armed O
captain O
, O
addressing O
Ahab O
; O
" O
go O
on O
, O
boy O
. O
" O
" O
Stood O
our O
old O
Sammy O
off O
to O
the O
northward O
, O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
blazing O
hot O
weather O
there O
on O
the O
Line O
. O
But O
it O
was O
no O
use—I O
did O
all O
I O
could O
; O
sat O
up O
with O
him O
nights O
; O
was O
very O
severe O
with O
him O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
diet— O
" O
" O
Oh O
, O
very O
severe O
! O
" O
chimed O
in O
the O
patient O
himself O
; O
then O
suddenly O
altering O
his O
voice O
, O
" O
Drinking O
hot O
rum O

about O
three O
o'clock O
in O
the O
morning O

Oh O
, O
ye O
stars O
! O
he O
sat O
up O
with O
me O
indeed O
, O

was O
very O
severe O
in O
my O
diet O

Oh O
! O
a O
great O
watcher O

very O
dietetically O
severe O

ye O

You O

But O
, O
heave O
ahead O
, O
boy O
, O
I O
'd O
rather O
be O
killed O
by O
you O

kept O
alive O

" O
" O
My O
captain O
, O
you O
must O
have O
ere O
this O
perceived O
, O
respected O
sir O
" O
—said O
the O
imperturbable O
godly-looking O
Bunger O
, O
slightly O
bowing O
to O
Ahab— O
" O
is O
apt O
to O
be O
facetious O
at O
times O
; O
he O
spins O
us O
many O
clever O
things O
of O
that O
sort O
. O
But O
I O
may O
as O
well O
say—en O
passant O
, O
as O
the O
French O
remark—that O
I O
myself—that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
Jack O
Bunger O
, O
late O
of O
the O
reverend O
clergy—am O
a O
strict O
total O
abstinence O
man O
; O
I O
never O
drink— O
" O
" O
Water O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
captain O
; O
" O
he O
never O
drinks O
it O
; O
it O
's O
a O
sort O
of O
fits O
to O
him O
; O
fresh O
water O
throws O
him O
into O
the O
hydrophobia O
; O
but O
go O
on—go O
on O
with O
the O
arm O
story O
. O
" O
" O
Yes O
, O
I O
may O
as O
well O
, O
" O
said O
the O
surgeon O
, O
coolly O
. O
" O
I O
was O
about O
observing O
, O
sir O
, O
before O
Captain O
Boomer O
's O
facetious O
interruption O
, O
that O
spite O
of O
my O
best O
and O
severest O
endeavors O
, O
the O
wound O
kept O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
; O
the O
truth O
was O
, O
sir O
, O
it O
was O
as O
ugly O
gaping O
wound O
as O
surgeon O
ever O
saw O
; O
more O
than O
two O
feet O
and O
several O
inches O
long O
. O
I O
measured O
it O
with O
the O
lead O
line O
. O
In O
short O
, O
it O
grew O
black O
; O
I O
knew O
what O
was O
threatened O
, O
and O
off O
it O
came O
. O
But O
I O
had O
no O
hand O
in O
shipping O
that O
ivory O
arm O
there O
; O
that O
thing O
is O
against O
all O
rule O
" O
—pointing O
at O
it O
with O
the O
marlingspike— O
" O
that O
is O
the O
captain O
's O
work O
, O
not O
mine O
; O
he O
ordered O
the O
carpenter O
to O
make O
it O
; O
he O
had O
that O
club-hammer O
there O
put O
to O
the O
end O
, O
to O
knock O
some O
one O
's O
brains O
out O
with O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
as O
he O
tried O
mine O
once O

He O
flies O
into O
diabolical O
passions O
sometimes O
. O
Do O
ye O
see O
this O
dent O
, O
sir O
" O
—removing O
his O
hat O
, O
and O
brushing O
aside O
his O
hair O
, O
and O
exposing O
a O
bowl-like O
cavity O
in O
his O
skull O
, O
but O
which O
bore O
not O
the O
slightest O
scarry O
trace O
, O
or O
any O
token O
of O
ever O
having O
been O
a O
wound— O
" O
Well O
, O
the O
captain O
there O
will O
tell O
you O
how O
that O
came O
here O
; O
he O
knows O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
, O
" O
said O
the O
captain O
, O
" O
but O
his O
mother O
did O
; O
he O
was O
born O
with O
it O
. O
Oh O
, O
you O
solemn O
rogue O
, O
you—you O
Bunger O
! O
was O
there O
ever O
such O
another O
Bunger O
in O
the O
watery O
world O
? O
Bunger O
, O
when O
you O
die O
, O
you O
ought O
to O
die O
in O
pickle O
, O
you O
dog O
; O
you O
should O
be O
preserved O
to O
future O
ages O
, O
you O
rascal O

" O
" O
What O
became O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
now O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
who O
thus O
far O
had O
been O
impatiently O
listening O
to O
this O
by-play O
between O
the O
two O
Englishmen O
. O
" O
Oh O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
one-armed O
captain O
, O
" O
oh O
, O
yes O
! O
Well O
; O
after O
he O
sounded O
, O
we O
did O
n't O
see O
him O
again O
for O
some O
time O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
as O
I O
before O
hinted O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
then O
know O
what O
whale O
it O
was O
that O
had O
served O
me O
such O
a O
trick O
, O
till O
some O
time O
afterwards O
, O
when O
coming O
back O
to O
the O
Line O
, O
we O
heard O
about O
Moby O
Dick—as O
some O
call O
him—and O
then O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
he O
. O
" O
" O
Did'st O
thou O
cross O
his O
wake O
again O
? O
" O
" O
Twice O
. O
" O
" O
But O
could O
not O
fasten O
? O
" O
" O
Did O
n't O
want O
to O
try O
to O
: O
ai O
n't O
one O
limb O
enough O
? O
What O
should O
I O
do O
without O
this O
other O
arm O
? O
And O
I O
'm O
thinking O
Moby O
Dick O
does O
n't O
bite O
so O
much O
as O
he O
swallows O
. O
" O
" O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
" O
interrupted O
Bunger O
, O
" O
give O
him O
your O
left O
arm O
for O
bait O
to O
get O
the O
right O
. O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
gentlemen O
" O
—very O
gravely O
and O
mathematically O
bowing O
to O
each O
Captain O
in O
succession— O
" O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
that O
the O
digestive O
organs O
of O
the O
whale O
are O
so O
inscrutably O
constructed O
by O
Divine O
Providence O
, O
that O
it O
is O
quite O
impossible O
for O
him O
to O
completely O
digest O
even O
a O
man O
's O
arm O
? O
And O
he O
knows O
it O
too O
. O
So O
that O
what O
you O
take O
for O
the O
White O
Whale O
's O
malice O
is O
only O
his O
awkwardness O
. O
For O
he O
never O
means O
to O
swallow O
a O
single O
limb O
; O
he O
only O
thinks O
to O
terrify O
by O
feints O
. O
But O
sometimes O
he O
is O
like O
the O
old O
juggling O
fellow O
, O
formerly O
a O
patient O
of O
mine O
in O
Ceylon O
, O
that O
making O
believe O
swallow O
jack-knives O
, O
once O
upon O
a O
time O
let O
one O
drop O
into O
him O
in O
good O
earnest O
, O
and O
there O
it O
stayed O
for O
a O
twelvemonth O
or O
more O
; O
when O
I O
gave O
him O
an O
emetic O
, O
and O
he O
heaved O
it O
up O
in O
small O
tacks O
, O
d O
'ye O
see O
. O
No O
possible O
way O
for O
him O
to O
digest O
that O
jack-knife O
, O
and O
fully O
incorporate O
it O
into O
his O
general O
bodily O
system O
. O
Yes O
, O
Captain O
Boomer O
, O
if O
you O
are O
quick O
enough O
about O
it O
, O
and O
have O
a O
mind O
to O
pawn O
one O
arm O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
privilege O
of O
giving O
decent O
burial O
to O
the O
other O
, O
why O
in O
that O
case O
the O
arm O
is O
yours O
; O
only O
let O
the O
whale O
have O
another O
chance O
at O
you O
shortly O
, O
that O
's O
all O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
thank O
ye O
, O
Bunger O
, O
" O
said O
the O
English O
Captain O
, O
" O
he O
's O
welcome O
to O
the O
arm O
he O
has O
, O
since O
I O
ca O
n't O
help O
it O
, O
and O
did O
n't O
know O
him O
then O
; O
but O
not O
to O
another O
one O
. O
No O
more O
White O
Whales O
for O
me O
; O
I O
've O
lowered O
for O
him O
once O
, O
and O
that O
has O
satisfied O
me O
. O
There O
would O
be O
great O
glory O
in O
killing O
him O
, O
I O
know O
that O
; O
and O
there O
is O
a O
ship-load O
of O
precious O
sperm O
in O
him O
, O
but O
, O
hark O
ye O
, O
he O
's O
best O
let O
alone O
; O
do O
n't O
you O
think O
so O
, O
Captain O
? O
" O
—glancing O
at O
the O
ivory O
leg O
. O
" O
He O
is O
. O
But O
he O
will O
still O
be O
hunted O
, O
for O
all O
that O
. O
What O
is O
best O
let O
alone O
, O
that O
accursed O
thing O
is O
not O
always O
what O
least O
allures O
. O
He O
's O
all O
a O
magnet O
! O
How O
long O
since O
thou O
saw'st O
him O
last O
? O
Which O
way O
heading O
? O
" O
" O
Bless O
my O
soul O
, O
and O
curse O
the O
foul O
fiend O
's O
, O
" O
cried O
Bunger O
, O
stoopingly O
walking O
round O
Ahab O
, O
and O
like O
a O
dog O
, O
strangely O
snuffing O
; O
" O
this O
man O

blood—bring O
the O
thermometer O
! O
—it O

boiling O
point O

—taking O
a O
lancet O
from O
his O
pocket O
, O
and O
drawing O
near O
to O
Ahab O
's O
arm O
. O
" O
Avast O
! O
" O
roared O
Ahab O
, O
dashing O
him O
against O
the O
bulwarks— O
" O
Man O
the O
boat O
! O
Which O
way O
heading O
? O
" O
" O
Good O
God O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
English O
Captain O
, O
to O
whom O
the O
question O
was O
put O
. O
" O
What O
's O
the O
matter O
? O
He O
was O
heading O
east O
, O
I O
think.—Is O
your O
Captain O
crazy O
? O
" O
whispering O
Fedallah O
. O
But O
Fedallah O
, O
putting O
a O
finger O
on O
his O
lip O
, O
slid O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
to O
take O
the O
boat O
's O
steering O
oar O
, O
and O
Ahab O
, O
swinging O
the O
cutting-tackle O
towards O
him O
, O
commanded O
the O
ship O
's O
sailors O
to O
stand O
by O
to O
lower O
. O
In O
a O
moment O
he O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
boat O

stern O
, O
and O
the O
Manilla O
men O
were O
springing O
to O
their O
oars O
. O
In O
vain O
the O
English O
Captain O
hailed O
him O
. O
With O
back O
to O
the O
stranger O
ship O
, O
and O
face O
set O
like O
a O
flint O
to O
his O
own O
, O
Ahab O
stood O
upright O
till O
alongside O
of O
the O
Pequod O
