And O
jolly O
enough O
were O
the O
sights O
and O
the O
sounds O
that O
came O
bearing O
down O
before O
the O
wind O
, O
some O
few O
weeks O
after O
Ahab O
's O
harpoon O
had O
been O
welded O
. O
It O
was O
a O
Nantucket O
ship O
, O
the O
Bachelor O
, O
which O
had O
just O
wedged O
in O
her O
last O
cask O
of O
oil O
, O
and O
bolted O
down O
her O
bursting O
hatches O
; O
and O
now O
, O
in O
glad O
holiday O
apparel O
, O
was O
joyously O
, O
though O
somewhat O
vain-gloriously O
, O
sailing O
round O
among O
the O
widely-separated O
ships O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
previous O
to O
pointing O
her O
prow O
for O
home O
. O
The O
three O
men O
at O
her O
mast-head O
wore O
long O
streamers O
of O
narrow O
red O
bunting O
at O
their O
hats O
; O
from O
the O
stern O
, O
a O
whale-boat O
was O
suspended O
, O
bottom O
down O
; O
and O
hanging O
captive O
from O
the O
bowsprit O
was O
seen O
the O
long O
lower O
jaw O
of O
the O
last O
whale O
they O
had O
slain O
. O
Signals O
, O
ensigns O
, O
and O
jacks O
of O
all O
colours O
were O
flying O
from O
her O
rigging O
, O
on O
every O
side O
. O
Sideways O
lashed O
in O
each O
of O
her O
three O
basketed O
tops O
were O
two O
barrels O
of O
sperm O
; O
above O
which O
, O
in O
her O
top-mast O
cross-trees O
, O
you O
saw O
slender O
breakers O
of O
the O
same O
precious O
fluid O
; O
and O
nailed O
to O
her O
main O
truck O
was O
a O
brazen O
lamp O
. O
As O
was O
afterwards O
learned O
, O
the O
Bachelor O
had O
met O
with O
the O
most O
surprising O
success O
; O
all O
the O
more O
wonderful O
, O
for O
that O
while O
cruising O
in O
the O
same O
seas O
numerous O
other O
vessels O
had O
gone O
entire O
months O
without O
securing O
a O
single O
fish O
. O
Not O
only O
had O
barrels O
of O
beef O
and O
bread O
been O
given O
away O
to O
make O
room O
for O
the O
far O
more O
valuable O
sperm O
, O
but O
additional O
supplemental O
casks O
had O
been O
bartered O
for O
, O
from O
the O
ships O
she O
had O
met O
; O
and O
these O
were O
stowed O
along O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
in O
the O
captain O
's O
and O
officers O
' O
state-rooms O
. O
Even O
the O
cabin O
table O
itself O
had O
been O
knocked O
into O
kindling-wood O
; O
and O
the O
cabin O
mess O
dined O
off O
the O
broad O
head O
of O
an O
oil-butt O
, O
lashed O
down O
to O
the O
floor O
for O
a O
centrepiece O
. O
In O
the O
forecastle O
, O
the O
sailors O
had O
actually O
caulked O
and O
pitched O
their O
chests O
, O
and O
filled O
them O
; O
it O
was O
humorously O
added O
, O
that O
the O
cook O
had O
clapped O
a O
head O
on O
his O
largest O
boiler O
, O
and O
filled O
it O
; O
that O
the O
steward O
had O
plugged O
his O
spare O
coffee-pot O
and O
filled O
it O
; O
that O
the O
harpooneers O
had O
headed O
the O
sockets O
of O
their O
irons O
and O
filled O
them O
; O
that O
indeed O
everything O
was O
filled O
with O
sperm O
, O
except O
the O
captain O
's O
pantaloons O
pockets O
, O
and O
those O
he O
reserved O
to O
thrust O
his O
hands O
into O
, O
in O
self-complacent O
testimony O
of O
his O
entire O
satisfaction O
. O
As O
this O
glad O
ship O
of O
good O
luck O
bore O
down O
upon O
the O
moody O
Pequod O
, O
the O
barbarian O
sound O
of O
enormous O
drums O
came O
from O
her O
forecastle O
; O
and O
drawing O
still O
nearer O
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
her O
men O
were O
seen O
standing O
round O
her O
huge O
try-pots O
, O
which O
, O
covered O
with O
the O
parchment-like O
_poke_ O
or O
stomach O
skin O
of O
the O
black O
fish O
, O
gave O
forth O
a O
loud O
roar O
to O
every O
stroke O
of O
the O
clenched O
hands O
of O
the O
crew O
. O
On O
the O
quarter-deck O
, O
the O
mates O
and O
harpooneers O
were O
dancing O
with O
the O
olive-hued O
girls O
who O
had O
eloped O
with O
them O
from O
the O
Polynesian O
Isles O
; O
while O
suspended O
in O
an O
ornamented O
boat O
, O
firmly O
secured O
aloft O
between O
the O
foremast O
and O
mainmast O
, O
three O
Long O
Island O
negroes O
, O
with O
glittering O
fiddle-bows O
of O
whale O
ivory O
, O
were O
presiding O
over O
the O
hilarious O
jig O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
others O
of O
the O
ship O
's O
company O
were O
tumultuously O
busy O
at O
the O
masonry O
of O
the O
try-works O
, O
from O
which O
the O
huge O
pots O
had O
been O
removed O
. O
You O
would O
have O
almost O
thought O
they O
were O
pulling O
down O
the O
cursed O
Bastille O
, O
such O
wild O
cries O
they O
raised O
, O
as O
the O
now O
useless O
brick O
and O
mortar O
were O
being O
hurled O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
Lord O
and O
master O
over O
all O
this O
scene O
, O
the O
captain O
stood O
erect O
on O
the O
ship O
's O
elevated O
quarter-deck O
, O
so O
that O
the O
whole O
rejoicing O
drama O
was O
full O
before O
him O
, O
and O
seemed O
merely O
contrived O
for O
his O
own O
individual O
diversion O
. O
And O
Ahab O
, O
he O
too O
was O
standing O
on O
his O
quarter-deck O
, O
shaggy O
and O
black O
, O
with O
a O
stubborn O
gloom O
; O
and O
as O
the O
two O
ships O
crossed O
each O
other O
's O
wakes—one O
all O
jubilations O
for O
things O
passed O
, O
the O
other O
all O
forebodings O
as O
to O
things O
to O
come—their O
two O
captains O
in O
themselves O
impersonated O
the O
whole O
striking O
contrast O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
" O
Come O
aboard O
, O
come O
aboard O
! O
" O
cried O
the O
gay O
Bachelor O
's O
commander O
, O
lifting O
a O
glass O
and O
a O
bottle O
in O
the O
air O
. O
" O
Hast O
seen O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
gritted O
Ahab O
in O
reply O
. O
" O
No O
; O
only O
heard O
of O
him O
; O
but O
do O
n't O
believe O
in O
him O
at O
all O
, O
" O
said O
the O
other O
good-humoredly O
. O
" O
Come O
aboard O
! O
" O
" O
Thou O
art O
too O
damned O
jolly O
. O
Sail O
on O
. O
Hast O
lost O
any O
men O
? O
" O
" O
Not O
enough O
to O
speak O
of—two O
islanders O
, O
that O
's O
all O
; O
—but O
come O
aboard O
, O
old O
hearty O
, O
come O
along O
. O
I O
'll O
soon O
take O
that O
black O
from O
your O
brow O
. O
Come O
along O
, O
will O
ye O
( O
merry O
's O
the O
play O
) O
; O
a O
full O
ship O
and O
homeward-bound O
. O
" O
" O
How O
wondrous O
familiar O
is O
a O
fool O
! O
" O
muttered O
Ahab O
; O
then O
aloud O
, O
" O
Thou O
art O
a O
full O
ship O
and O
homeward O
bound O
, O
thou O
sayst O
; O
well O
, O
then O
, O
call O
me O
an O
empty O
ship O
, O
and O
outward-bound O
. O
So O
go O
thy O
ways O
, O
and O
I O
will O
mine O
. O
Forward O
there O
! O
Set O
all O
sail O
, O
and O
keep O
her O
to O
the O
wind O
! O
" O
And O
thus O
, O
while O
the O
one O
ship O
went O
cheerily O
before O
the O
breeze O
, O
the O
other O
stubbornly O
fought O
against O
it O
; O
and O
so O
the O
two O
vessels O
parted O
; O
the O
crew O
of O
the O
Pequod O
looking O
with O
grave O
, O
lingering O
glances O
towards O
the O
receding O
Bachelor O
; O
but O
the O
Bachelor O
's O
men O
never O
heeding O
their O
gaze O
for O
the O
lively O
revelry O
they O
were O
in O
. O
And O
as O
Ahab O
, O
leaning O
over O
the O
taffrail O
, O
eyed O
the O
homeward-bound O
craft O
, O
he O
took O
from O
his O
pocket O
a O
small O
vial O
of O
sand O
, O
and O
then O
looking O
from O
the O
ship O
to O
the O
vial O
, O
seemed O
thereby O
bringing O
two O
remote O
associations O
together O
, O
for O
that O
vial O
was O
filled O
with O
Nantucket O
soundings O
. O
