There O
are O
certain O
queer O
times O
and O
occasions O
in O
this O
strange O
mixed O
affair O
we O
call O
life O
when O
a O
man O
takes O
this O
whole O
universe O
for O
a O
vast O
practical O
joke O
, O
though O
the O
wit O
thereof O
he O
but O
dimly O
discerns O
, O
and O
more O
than O
suspects O
that O
the O
joke O
is O
at O
nobody O
’ O
s O
expense O
but O
his O
own O
. O
However O
, O
nothing O
dispirits O
, O
and O
nothing O
seems O
worth O
while O
disputing O
. O
He O
bolts O
down O
all O
events O
, O
all O
creeds O
, O
and O
beliefs O
, O
and O
persuasions O
, O
all O
hard O
things O
visible O
and O
invisible O
, O
never O
mind O
how O
knobby O
; O
as O
an O
ostrich O
of O
potent O
digestion O
gobbles O
down O
bullets O
and O
gun O
flints O
. O
And O
as O
for O
small O
difficulties O
and O
worryings O
, O
prospects O
of O
sudden O
disaster O
, O
peril O
of O
life O
and O
limb O
; O
all O
these O
, O
and O
death O
itself O
, O
seem O
to O
him O
only O
sly O
, O
good-natured O
hits O
, O
and O
jolly O
punches O
in O
the O
side O
bestowed O
by O
the O
unseen O
and O
unaccountable O
old O
joker O
. O
That O
odd O
sort O
of O
wayward O
mood O
I O
am O
speaking O
of O
, O
comes O
over O
a O
man O
only O
in O
some O
time O
of O
extreme O
tribulation O
; O
it O
comes O
in O
the O
very O
midst O
of O
his O
earnestness O
, O
so O
that O
what O
just O
before O
might O
have O
seemed O
to O
him O
a O
thing O
most O
momentous O
, O
now O
seems O
but O
a O
part O
of O
the O
general O
joke O
. O
There O
is O
nothing O
like O
the O
perils O
of O
whaling O
to O
breed O
this O
free O
and O
easy O
sort O
of O
genial O
, O
desperado O
philosophy O
; O
and O
with O
it O
I O
now O
regarded O
this O
whole O
voyage O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
and O
the O
great O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
its O
object O
. O
“ O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
when O
they O
had O
dragged O
me O
, O
the O
last O
man O
, O
to O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
I O
was O
still O
shaking O
myself O
in O
my O
jacket O
to O
fling O
off O
the O
water O
; O
“ O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
my O
fine O
friend O
, O
does O
this O
sort O
of O
thing O
often O
happen O
? O
” O
Without O
much O
emotion O
, O
though O
soaked O
through O
just O
like O
me O
, O
he O
gave O
me O
to O
understand O
that O
such O
things O
did O
often O
happen O
. O
“ O
Mr. B-CHR
Stubb I-CHR
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
turning O
to O
that O
worthy O
, O
who O
, O
buttoned O
up O
in O
his O
oil-jacket O
, O
was O
now O
calmly O
smoking O
his O
pipe O
in O
the O
rain O
; O
“ O
Mr. B-CHR
Stubb I-CHR
, O
I O
think O
I O
have O
heard O
you O
say O
that O
of O
all O
whalemen O

ever O
met O
, O

chief O
mate O
, O
Mr. B-CHR
Starbuck I-CHR
, O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
careful O
and O
prudent O
. O
I O
suppose O
then O
, O
that O
going O
plump O
on O
a O
flying O
whale O
with O
your O
sail O
set O
in O
a O
foggy O
squall O

of O

” O
“ O

. O
” O
“ O
Mr. B-CHR
Flask I-CHR
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
turning O
to O
little O
King-Post B-CHR
, O
who O
was O
standing O
close O
by O
; O
“ O
you O
are O
experienced O
in O
these O
things O
, O
and O
I O
am O
not O
. O
Will O
you O
tell O
me O
whether O
it O
is O
an O
unalterable O
law O
in O
this O
fishery O
, O
Mr. B-CHR
Flask I-CHR
, O
for O
an O
oarsman O
to O
break O
his O
own O
back O
pulling O
himself O
back-foremost O
into O
death O
’ O
s O
jaws O
? O
” O
“ O
Can O
’ O
t O
you O
twist O
that O
smaller O
? O
” O
said O
Flask B-CHR
. O
“ O
Yes O
, O
that O
’ O
s O
the O
law O
. O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
a O
boat O

s O
crew O
backing O
water O
up O
to O
a O
whale O

foremost O

Ha O
, O
ha O
! O
the O
whale O
would O
give O
them O
squint O
for O
squint O
, O
mind O
that O
! O
” O
Here O
then O
, O
from O
three O
impartial O
witnesses O
, O
I O
had O
a O
deliberate O
statement O
of O
the O
entire O
case O
. O
Considering O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
squalls O
and O
capsizings O
in O
the O
water O
and O
consequent O
bivouacks O
on O
the O
deep O
, O
were O
matters O
of O
common O
occurrence O
in O
this O
kind O
of O
life O
; O
considering O
that O
at O
the O
superlatively O
critical O
instant O
of O
going O
on O
to O
the O
whale O
I O
must O
resign O
my O
life O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
him O
who O
steered O
the O
boat—oftentimes O
a O
fellow O
who O
at O
that O
very O
moment O
is O
in O
his O
impetuousness O
upon O
the O
point O
of O
scuttling O
the O
craft O
with O
his O
own O
frantic O
stampings O
; O
considering O
that O
the O
particular O
disaster O
to O
our O
own O
particular O
boat O
was O
chiefly O
to O
be O
imputed O
to O
Starbuck B-CHR
’ O
s O
driving O
on O
to O
his O
whale O
almost O
in O
the O
teeth O
of O
a O
squall O
, O
and O
considering O
that O
Starbuck B-CHR
, O
notwithstanding O
, O
was O
famous O
for O
his O
great O
heedfulness O
in O
the O
fishery O
; O
considering O
that O
I O
belonged O
to O
this O
uncommonly O
prudent O
Starbuck B-CHR
’ O
s O
boat O
; O
and O
finally O
considering O
in O
what O
a O
devil O
’ O
s O
chase O
I O
was O
implicated O
, O
touching O
the O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
: O
taking O
all O
things O
together O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
might O
as O
well O
go O
below O
and O
make O
a O
rough O
draft O
of O
my O
will O
. O
“ O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
“ O
come O
along O
, O
you O
shall O
be O
my O
lawyer O
, O
executor O
, O
and O
legatee O
. O
” O
It O
may O
seem O
strange O
that O
of O
all O
men O
sailors O
should O
be O
tinkering O
at O
their O
last O
wills O
and O
testaments O
, O
but O
there O
are O
no O
people O
in O
the O
world O
more O
fond O
of O
that O
diversion O
. O
This O
was O
the O
fourth O
time O
in O
my O
nautical O
life O
that O
I O
had O
done O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
After O
the O
ceremony O
was O
concluded O
upon O
the O
present O
occasion O
, O
I O
felt O
all O
the O
easier O
; O
a O
stone O
was O
rolled O
away O
from O
my O
heart O
. O
Besides O
, O
all O
the O
days O
I O
should O
now O
live O
would O
be O
as O
good O
as O
the O
days O
that O
Lazarus B-CHR
lived O
after O
his O
resurrection O
; O
a O
supplementary O
clean O
gain O
of O
so O
many O
months O
or O
weeks O
as O
the O
case O
might O
be O
. O
I O
survived O
myself O
; O
my O
death O
and O
burial O
were O
locked O
up O
in O
my O
chest O
. O
I O
looked O
round O
me O
tranquilly O
and O
contentedly O
, O
like O
a O
quiet O
ghost O
with O
a O
clean O
conscience O
sitting O
inside O
the O
bars O
of O
a O
snug O
family O
vault O
. O
Now O
then O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
unconsciously O
rolling O
up O
the O
sleeves O
of O
my O
frock O
, O
here O
goes O
for O
a O
cool O
, O
collected O
dive O
at O
death O
and O
destruction O
, O
and O
