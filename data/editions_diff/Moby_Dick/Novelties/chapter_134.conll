At O
day-break O
, O
the O
three O
mast-heads O
were O
punctually O
manned O
afresh O
. O
“ O
D O
’ O
ye O
see O
him O
? O
” O
cried O
Ahab B-CHR
after O
allowing O
a O
little O
space O
for O
the O
light O
to O
spread O
. O
“ O
See O
nothing O
, O
sir O
. O
” O
“ O
Turn O
up O
all O
hands O
and O
make O
sail O
! O
he O
travels O
faster O
than O
I O
thought O
for O
; O
—the O
top-gallant O
sails O
! O
—aye O
, O
they O
should O
have O
been O
kept O
on O
her O
all O
night O
. O
But O
no O
matter— O
’ O
tis O
but O
resting O
for O
the O
rush O
. O
” O
Here O
be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
this O
pertinacious O
pursuit O
of O
one O
particular O
whale O
, O
continued O
through O
day O
into O
night O
, O
and O
through O
night O
into O
day O
, O
is O
a O
thing O
by O
no O
means O
unprecedented O
in O
the O
South B-LOC
sea I-LOC
fishery O
. O
For O
such O
is O
the O
wonderful O
skill O
, O
prescience O
of O
experience O
, O
and O
invincible O
confidence O
acquired O
by O
some O
great O
natural O
geniuses O
among O
the O
Nantucket B-LOC
commanders O
; O
that O
from O
the O
simple O
observation O
of O
a O
whale O
when O
last O
descried O
, O
they O
will O
, O
under O
certain O
given O
circumstances O
, O
pretty O
accurately O
foretell O
both O
the O
direction O
in O
which O
he O
will O
continue O
to O
swim O
for O
a O
time O
, O
while O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
probable O
rate O
of O
progression O
during O
that O
period O
. O
And O
, O
in O
these O
cases O
, O
somewhat O
as O
a O
pilot O
, O
when O
about O
losing O
sight O
of O
a O
coast O
, O
whose O
general O
trending O
he O
well O
knows O
, O
and O
which O
he O
desires O
shortly O
to O
return O
to O
again O
, O
but O
at O
some O
further O
point O
; O
like O
as O
this O
pilot O
stands O
by O
his O
compass O
, O
and O
takes O
the O
precise O
bearing O
of O
the O
cape O
at O
present O
visible O
, O
in O
order O
the O
more O
certainly O
to O
hit O
aright O
the O
remote O
, O
unseen O
headland O
, O
eventually O
to O
be O
visited O
: O
so O
does O
the O
fisherman O
, O
at O
his O
compass O
, O
with O
the O
whale O
; O
for O
after O
being O
chased O
, O
and O
diligently O
marked O
, O
through O
several O
hours O
of O
daylight O
, O
then O
, O
when O
night O
obscures O
the O
fish O
, O
the O
creature O
’ O
s O
future O
wake O
through O
the O
darkness O
is O
almost O
as O
established O
to O
the O
sagacious O
mind O
of O
the O
hunter O
, O
as O
the O
pilot O
’ O
s O
coast O
is O
to O
him O
. O
So O
that O
to O
this O
hunter O
’ O
s O
wondrous O
skill O
, O
the O
proverbial O
evanescence O
of O
a O
thing O
writ O
in O
water O
, O
a O
wake O
, O
is O
to O
all O
desired O
purposes O
well O
nigh O
as O
reliable O
as O
the O
steadfast O
land O
. O
And O
as O
the O
mighty O
iron O
Leviathan B-CHR
of O
the O
modern O
railway O
is O
so O
familiarly O
known O
in O
its O
every O
pace O
, O
that O
, O
with O
watches O
in O
their O
hands O
, O
men O
time O
his O
rate O
as O
doctors O
that O
of O
a O
baby O
’ O
s O
pulse O
; O
and O
lightly O
say O
of O
it O
, O
the O
up O
train O
or O
the O
down O
train O
will O
reach O
such O
or O
such O
a O
spot O
, O
at O
such O
or O
such O
an O
hour O
; O
even O
so O
, O
almost O
, O
there O
are O
occasions O
when O
these O
Nantucketers B-GRP
time O
that O
other O
Leviathan B-CHR
of O
the O
deep O
, O
according O
to O
the O
observed O
humor O
of O
his O
speed O
; O
and O
say O
to O
themselves O
, O
so O
many O
hours O
hence O
this O
whale O
will O
have O
gone O
two O
hundred O
miles O
, O
will O
have O
about O
reached O
this O
or O
that O
degree O
of O
latitude O
or O
longitude O
. O
But O
to O
render O
this O
acuteness O
at O
all O
successful O
in O
the O
end O
, O
the O
wind O
and O
the O
sea O

be O

whaleman O

allies O
; O
for O
of O
what O
present O
avail O
to O
the O
becalmed O
or O
windbound O
mariner O
is O
the O
skill O
that O
assures O
him O
he O
is O
exactly O
ninety-three O
leagues O
and O
a O
quarter O
from O
his O
port O
? O
Inferable O
from O
these O
statements O
, O
are O
many O
collateral O
subtile O
matters O
touching O
the O
chase O
of O
whales O
. O
The O
ship O
tore O
on O
; O
leaving O
such O
a O
furrow O
in O
the O
sea O
as O
when O
a O
cannon-ball O
, O
missent O
, O
becomes O
a O
plough-share O
and O
turns O
up O
the O
level O
field O
. O
“ O
By O
salt O
and O
hemp O
! O
” O
cried O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
“ O
but O
this O
swift O
motion O
of O
the O
deck O
creeps O
up O
one O

tingles O
at O
the O
heart O

This O
ship O
and O
I O
are O
two O
brave O
fellows O
! O
—Ha O

Some O

“ O
There O
she O
blows—she O
blows O
! O
—she O
blows O

ahead O

was O
now O
the O
mast-head O
cry O
. O
“ O
Aye O
, O
aye O
! O
” O
cried O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
“ O
I O

it—ye O

Ahab B-CHR

dam O

miller O

his O
watergate O

” O
And O
Stubb B-CHR
did O
but O
speak O
out O
for O
well O
nigh O
all O
that O
crew O
. O
The O
frenzies O
of O
the O
chase O
had O
by O
this O
time O
worked O
them O
bubblingly O
up O
, O
like O
old O
wine O
worked O
anew O
. O
Whatever O
pale O
fears O
and O
forebodings O
some O
of O
them O
might O
have O
felt O
before O
; O
these O
were O
not O
only O
now O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
through O
the O
growing O
awe O
of O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
but O
they O
were O
broken O
up O
, O
and O
on O
all O
sides O
routed O
, O
as O
timid O
prairie O
hares O
that O
scatter O
before O
the O
bounding O
bison O
. O
The O
hand O
of O
Fate O
had O
snatched O
all O
their O
souls O
; O
and O
by O
the O
stirring O
perils O
of O
the O
previous O
day O
; O
the O
rack O
of O
the O
past O
night O
’ O
s O
suspense O
; O
the O
fixed O
, O
unfearing O
, O
blind O
, O
reckless O
way O
in O
which O
their O
wild O
craft O
went O
plunging O
towards O
its O
flying O
mark O
; O
by O
all O
these O
things O
, O
their O
hearts O
were O
bowled O
along O
. O
The O
wind O
that O
made O
great O
bellies O
of O
their O
sails O
, O
and O
rushed O
the O
vessel O
on O
by O
arms O
invisible O
as O
irresistible O
; O
this O
seemed O
the O
symbol O
of O
that O
unseen O
agency O
which O
so O
enslaved O
them O
to O
the O
race O
. O
They O
were O
one O
man O
, O
not O
thirty O
. O
For O
as O
the O
one O
ship O
that O
held O
them O
all O
; O
though O
it O
was O
put O
together O
of O
all O
contrasting O
things—oak O
, O
and O
maple O
, O
and O
pine O
wood O
; O
iron O
, O
and O
pitch O
, O
and O
hemp—yet O
all O
these O
ran O
into O
each O
other O
in O
the O
one O
concrete O
hull O
, O
which O
shot O
on O
its O
way O
, O
both O
balanced O
and O
directed O
by O
the O
long O
central O
keel O
; O
even O
so O
, O
all O
the O
individualities O
of O
the O
crew O
, O
this O
man O
’ O
s O
valor O
, O
that O
man O
’ O
s O
fear O
; O
guilt O
and O
guiltiness O
, O
all O
varieties O
were O
welded O
into O
oneness O
, O
and O
were O
all O
directed O
to O
that O
fatal O
goal O
which O
Ahab B-CHR
their O
one O
lord O
and O
keel O
did O
point O
to O
. O
The O
rigging O
lived O
. O
The O
mast-heads O
, O
like O
the O
tops O
of O
tall O
palms O
, O
were O
outspreadingly O
tufted O
with O
arms O
and O
legs O
. O
Clinging O
to O
a O
spar O
with O
one O
hand O
, O
some O
reached O
forth O
the O
other O
with O
impatient O
wavings O
; O
others O
, O
shading O
their O
eyes O
from O
the O
vivid O
sunlight O
, O
sat O
far O
out O
on O
the O
rocking O
yards O
; O
all O
the O
spars O
in O
full O
bearing O
of O
mortals O
, O
ready O
and O
ripe O
for O
their O
fate O
. O
Ah O
! O
how O
they O
still O
strove O
through O
that O
infinite O
blueness O
to O
seek O
out O
the O
thing O
that O
might O
destroy O
them O
! O
“ O
Why O
sing O
ye O
not O
out O
for O
him O
, O
if O

” O
cried O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
when O
, O
after O
the O
lapse O
of O
some O
minutes O
since O
the O
first O
cry O
, O
no O
more O
had O
been O

one O

” O
It O
was O
even O
so O
; O
in O
their O
headlong O
eagerness O
, O
the O
men O
had O
mistaken O
some O
other O
thing O
for O
the O
whale-spout O
, O
as O
the O
event O
itself O
soon O
proved O
; O
for O
hardly O
had O
Ahab B-CHR
reached O
his O
perch O
; O
hardly O
was O
the O
rope O
belayed O
to O
its O
pin O
on O
deck O
, O
when O
he O
struck O
the O
key-note O
to O
an O
orchestra O
, O
that O
made O
the O
air O
vibrate O
as O
with O
the O
combined O
discharges O
of O
rifles O
. O
The O
triumphant O
halloo O
of O
thirty O
buckskin O
lungs O
was O
heard O
, O
as—much O
nearer O
to O
the O
ship O

of O

imaginary O

by O
the O
peaceable O
gush O
of O
that O
mystic O
fountain O
in O
his O
head O

did O
the O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
now O
reveal O
his O
vicinity O
; O
but O
by O
the O
far O
more O
wondrous O
phenomenon O
of O
breaching O
. O
Rising O
with O
his O
utmost O
velocity O
from O
the O
furthest O
depths O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
thus O
booms O
his O
entire O
bulk O
into O
the O
pure O
element O
of O

piling O
up O

moments O

off O

in O
some O
cases O

this O

“ O
There O

was O
the O
cry O
, O
as O
in O
his O
immeasurable O
bravadoes O
the O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
tossed O
himself O
salmon-like O
to O

So O
suddenly O
seen O
in O
the O
blue O

relieved O
against O

bluer O
margin O

the O
spray O
that O
he O
raised O

for O
the O
moment O

intolerably O
glittered O

glared O

glacier O

stood O
there O
gradually O
fading O

fading O
away O
from O
its O
first O
sparkling O
intensity O
, O
to O
the O
dim O
mistiness O
of O

advancing O
shower O

heedless O
of O

at O

evolutions O

the O
White B-CHR

so O
crossed O

in O
a O

more O
tremendous O

Seizing O
that O
opportunity O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
first O
paid O
out O
more O
line O

and O
then O
was O
rapidly O
hauling O
and O
jerking O
in O
upon O
it O
again—hoping O
that O
way O
to O
disencumber O
it O
of O
some O
snarls—when O
lo O
! O
—a O
sight O
more O
savage O
than O

embattled O

twisted—corkscrewed O

all O
their O
bristling O
barbs O

came O
flashing O

dripping O
up O
to O
the O
chocks O
in O

bows O
of O

Only O
one O
thing O
could O
be O
done O
. O
Seizing O
the O
boat-knife O
, O
he O
critically O
reached O
within—through—and O
then O
, O
without—the O
rays O
of O
steel O
; O
dragged O
in O
the O

beyond O

passed O
it O

then O
, O
twice O
sundering O

the O
intercepted O
fagot O
of O

into O
the O
sea O

was O
all O
fast O
again O

That O
instant O
, O
the O
White B-CHR

made O
a O
sudden O
rush O
among O

remaining O
tangles O
of O

lines O
; O
by O
so O
doing O
, O
irresistibly O
dragged O
the O
more O
involved O
boats O
of O
Stubb B-CHR

Flask B-CHR
towards O
his O
flukes O
; O
dashed O
them O
together O
like O
two O
rolling O
husks O
on O
a O
surf-beaten O
beach O
, O
and O
then O
, O
diving O
down O
into O
the O
sea O

disappeared O
in O

boiling O
maelstrom O

, O
for O
a O
space O
, O
the O
odorous O
cedar O
chips O

danced O
round O

bobbed O
up O

down O
like O
an O
empty O
vial O

twitching O
his O
legs O
upwards O
to O
escape O

dreaded O
jaws O

lustily O
singing O
out O

up O

pulling O
into O

pool O

could O
; O
—in O

thousand O
concreted O
perils O

— O
Ahab B-CHR

drawn O
up O
towards O
Heaven B-LOC
by O
invisible O
wires O
, O
—as O
, O
arrow-like O
, O
shooting O
perpendicularly O
from O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
dashed O
his O
broad O
forehead O
against O
its O
bottom O
, O
and O
sent O
it O
, O
turning O
over O
and O
over O
, O
into O
the O
air O
; O
till O
it O
fell O
again—gunwale O
downwards—and O
Ahab B-CHR
and O
his O
men O
struggled O
out O
from O
under O
it O
, O
like O
seals O
from O
a O
sea-side O
cave O
. O
The O
first O
uprising O
momentum O
of O
the O
whale—modifying O
its O
direction O
as O
he O
struck O
the O
surface—involuntarily O
launched O
him O
along O
it O
, O
to O
a O
little O
distance O
from O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
destruction O
he O
had O
made O
; O
and O
with O
his O
back O
to O
it O
, O
he O
now O
lay O
for O
a O
moment O
slowly O
feeling O
with O
his O
flukes O
from O
side O
to O
side O
; O
and O
whenever O
a O
stray O
oar O
, O
bit O
of O
plank O
, O
the O
least O
chip O
or O
crumb O
of O
the O
boats O
touched O
his O
skin O
, O
his O
tail O
swiftly O
drew O
back O
, O
and O
came O
sideways O
smiting O
the O
sea O
. O
But O
soon O
, O
as O
if O
satisfied O
that O
his O
work O
for O
that O
time O
was O
done O
, O
he O
pushed O
his O
pleated O
forehead O
through O
the O
ocean O
, O
and O
trailing O
after O
him O
the O
intertangled O
lines O
, O
continued O
his O
leeward O
way O
at O
a O
traveller O

methodic O
pace O
. O
As O
before O
, O
the O
attentive O
ship O
having O
descried O
the O
whole O
fight O
, O
again O
came O
bearing O
down O
to O
the O
rescue O
, O
and O
dropping O
a O
boat O
, O
picked O
up O
the O
floating O
mariners O
, O
tubs O
, O
oars O
, O
and O
whatever O
else O
could O
be O
caught O
at O
, O
and O
safely O
landed O
them O
on O
her O
decks O
. O
Some O
sprained O
shoulders O
, O
wrists O
, O

ankles O
; O
livid O
contusions O
; O
wrenched O

; O
shattered O

all O
these O
were O
there O
; O
but O
no O
fatal O
or O
even O
serious O
ill O
seemed O
to O
have O
befallen O
any O
one O
. O
As O
with O
Fedallah B-CHR
the O
day O
before O
, O
so O
Ahab B-CHR
was O
now O
found O
grimly O
clinging O
to O
his O
boat O

broken O
half O

afforded O
a O
comparatively O
easy O

But O
when O
he O
was O
helped O
to O
the O
deck O

all O
eyes O
were O
fastened O
upon O

still O
half-hung O
