For O
several O
days O
after O
leaving O
Nantucket B-LOC
, O
nothing O
above O
hatches O
was O
seen O
of O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
. O
The O
mates O
regularly O
relieved O
each O
other O
at O
the O
watches O
, O
and O
for O
aught O
that O
could O
be O
seen O
to O
the O
contrary O
, O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
only O
commanders O
of O
the O
ship O
; O
only O
they O
sometimes O
issued O
from O
the O
cabin O
with O
orders O
so O
sudden O
and O
peremptory O
, O
that O
after O
all O
it O
was O
plain O
they O
but O
commanded O
vicariously O
. O
Yes O
, O
their O
supreme O
lord O
and O
dictator O
was O
there O
, O
though O
hitherto O
unseen O
by O
any O
eyes O
not O
permitted O
to O
penetrate O
into O
the O
now O
sacred O
retreat O
of O
the O
cabin O
. O
Every O
time O
I O
ascended O
to O
the O
deck O
from O
my O
watches O
below O
, O
I O
instantly O
gazed O
aft O
to O
mark O
if O
any O
strange O
face O
were O
visible O
; O
for O
my O
first O
vague O
disquietude O
touching O
the O
unknown O
captain O
, O
now O
in O
the O
seclusion O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
became O
almost O
a O
perturbation O
. O
This O
was O
strangely O
heightened O
at O
times O
by O
the O
ragged O
Elijah B-CHR
’ O
s O
diabolical O
incoherences O
uninvitedly O
recurring O
to O
me O
, O
with O
a O
subtle O
energy O
I O
could O
not O
have O
before O
conceived O
of O
. O
But O
poorly O
could O
I O
withstand O
them O
, O
much O
as O
in O
other O
moods O
I O
was O
almost O
ready O
to O
smile O
at O
the O
solemn O
whimsicalities O
of O
that O
outlandish O
prophet O
of O
the O
wharves O
. O
But O
whatever O
it O
was O
of O
apprehensiveness O
or O
uneasiness—to O
call O
it O
so—which O
I O
felt O
, O
yet O
whenever O
I O
came O
to O
look O
about O
me O
in O
the O
ship O
, O
it O
seemed O
against O
all O
warrantry O
to O
cherish O
such O
emotions O
. O
For O
though O
the O
harpooneers O
, O
with O
the O
great O
body O
of O
the O
crew O
, O
were O
a O
far O
more O
barbaric O
, O
heathenish O
, O
and O
motley O
set O
than O
any O
of O
the O
tame O
merchant-ship O
companies O
which O
my O
previous O
experiences O
had O
made O
me O
acquainted O
with O
, O
still O
I O
ascribed O
this—and O
rightly O
ascribed O
it—to O
the O
fierce O
uniqueness O
of O
the O
very O
nature O
of O
that O
wild O
Scandinavian B-GRP
vocation O
in O
which O
I O
had O
so O
abandonedly O
embarked O
. O
But O
it O
was O
especially O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
three O
chief O
officers O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
the O
mates O
, O
which O
was O
most O
forcibly O
calculated O
to O
allay O
these O
colourless O
misgivings O
, O
and O
induce O
confidence O
and O
cheerfulness O
in O
every O
presentment O
of O
the O
voyage O
. O
Three O
better O
, O
more O
likely O
sea-officers O
and O
men O
, O
each O
in O
his O
own O
different O
way O
, O
could O
not O
readily O
be O
found O
, O
and O
they O
were O
every O
one O
of O
them O
Americans B-GRP
; O
a O
Nantucketer B-GRP
, O
a O
Vineyarder B-GRP
, O
a O
Cape O
man O
. O
Now O
, O
it O
being O
Christmas B-MSC
when O
the O
ship O
shot O
from O
out O
her O
harbor O
, O
for O
a O
space O
we O
had O
biting O
Polar B-GRP
weather O
, O
though O
all O
the O
time O
running O
away O
from O
it O
to O
the O
southward O
; O
and O
by O
every O
degree O
and O
minute O
of O
latitude O
which O
we O
sailed O
, O
gradually O
leaving O
that O
merciless O
winter O
, O
and O
all O
its O
intolerable O
weather O
behind O
us O
. O
It O
was O
one O
of O
those O
less O
lowering O
, O
but O
still O
grey O
and O
gloomy O
enough O
mornings O
of O
the O
transition O
, O
when O
with O
a O
fair O
wind O
the O
ship O
was O
rushing O
through O
the O
water O
with O
a O
vindictive O
sort O
of O
leaping O
and O
melancholy O
rapidity O
, O
that O
as O
I O
mounted O
to O
the O
deck O
at O
the O
call O
of O
the O
forenoon O
watch O
, O
so O
soon O
as O
I O
levelled O
my O
glance O
towards O
the O
taffrail O
, O
foreboding O
shivers O
ran O
over O
me O
. O
Reality O
outran O
apprehension O
; O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
stood O
upon O
his O
quarter-deck O
. O
There O
seemed O
no O
sign O
of O
common O
bodily O
illness O
about O
him O
, O
nor O
of O
the O
recovery O
from O
any O
. O
He O
looked O
like O
a O
man O
cut O
away O
from O
the O
stake O
, O
when O
the O
fire O
has O
overrunningly O
wasted O
all O
the O
limbs O
without O
consuming O
them O
, O
or O
taking O
away O
one O
particle O
from O
their O
compacted O
aged O
robustness O
. O
His O
whole O
high O
, O
broad O
form O
, O
seemed O
made O
of O
solid O
bronze O
, O
and O
shaped O
in O
an O
unalterable O
mould O
, O
like O
Cellini B-CHR
’ O
s O
cast O
Perseus B-MSC
. O
Threading O
its O
way O
out O
from O
among O
his O
grey O
hairs O
, O
and O
continuing O
right O
down O
one O
side O
of O
his O
tawny O
scorched O
face O
and O
neck O
, O
till O
it O
disappeared O
in O
his O
clothing O
, O
you O
saw O
a O
slender O
rod-like O
mark O
, O
lividly O
whitish O
. O
It O
resembled O
that O
perpendicular O
seam O
sometimes O
made O
in O
the O
straight O
, O
lofty O
trunk O
of O
a O
great O
tree O
, O
when O
the O
upper O
lightning O
tearingly O
darts O
down O
it O
, O
and O
without O
wrenching O
a O
single O
twig O
, O
peels O
and O
grooves O
out O
the O
bark O
from O
top O
to O
bottom O
, O
ere O
running O
off O
into O
the O
soil O
, O
leaving O
the O
tree O
still O
greenly O
alive O
, O
but O
branded O
. O
Whether O
that O
mark O
was O
born O
with O
him O
, O
or O
whether O
it O
was O
the O
scar O
left O
by O
some O
desperate O
wound O
, O
no O
one O
could O
certainly O
say O
. O
By O
some O
tacit O
consent O
, O
throughout O
the O
voyage O
little O
or O
no O
allusion O
was O
made O
to O
it O
, O
especially O
by O
the O
mates O
. O
But O
once O
Tashtego B-CHR
’ O
s O
senior O
, O
an O
old O
Gay-Head B-GRP
Indian B-GRP
among O
the O
crew O
, O
superstitiously O
asserted O
that O
not O
till O
he O
was O
full O
forty O
years O
old O
did O
Ahab B-CHR
become O
that O
way O
branded O
, O
and O
then O
it O
came O
upon O
him O
, O
not O
in O
the O
fury O
of O
any O
mortal O
fray O
, O
but O
in O
an O
elemental O
strife O
at O
sea O
. O
Yet O
, O
this O
wild O
hint O
seemed O
inferentially O
negatived O
, O
by O
what O
a O
grey O
Manxman B-CHR
insinuated O
, O
an O
old O
sepulchral O
man O
, O
who O
, O
having O
never O
before O
sailed O
out O
of O
Nantucket B-LOC
, O
had O
never O
ere O
this O
laid O
eye O
upon O
wild O
Ahab B-CHR
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
old O
sea-traditions O
, O
the O
immemorial O
credulities O
, O
popularly O
invested O
this O
old O
Manxman B-CHR
with O
preternatural O
powers O
of O
discernment O
. O
So O
that O
no O
white O
sailor O
seriously O
contradicted O
him O
when O
he O
said O
that O
if O
ever O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
should O
be O
tranquilly O
laid O
out—which O
might O
hardly O
come O
to O
pass O
, O
so O
he O
muttered—then O
, O
whoever O
should O
do O
that O
last O
office O
for O
the O
dead O
, O
would O
find O
a O
birth-mark O
on O
him O
from O
crown O
to O
sole O
. O
So O
powerfully O
did O
the O
whole O
grim O
aspect O
of O
Ahab B-CHR
affect O
me O
, O
and O
the O
livid O
brand O
which O
streaked O
it O
, O
that O
for O
the O
first O
few O
moments O
I O
hardly O
noted O
that O
not O
a O
little O
of O
this O
overbearing O
grimness O
was O
owing O
to O
the O
barbaric O
white O
leg O
upon O
which O
he O
partly O
stood O
. O
It O
had O
previously O
come O
to O
me O
that O
this O
ivory O
leg O
had O
at O
sea O
been O
fashioned O
from O
the O
polished O
bone O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
’ O
s O
jaw O
. O
“ O
Aye O
, O
he O
was O
dismasted O
off O
Japan B-LOC
, O
” O
said O
the O
old O
Gay-Head B-GRP
Indian B-GRP
once O
; O
“ O
but O
like O
his O
dismasted O
craft O
, O
he O
shipped O
another O
mast O
without O
coming O
home O
for O
it O
. O
He O
has O
a O
quiver O
of O
’ O
em O
. O
” O
I O
was O
struck O
with O
the O
singular O
posture O
he O
maintained O
. O
Upon O
each O
side O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
quarter O
deck O
, O
and O
pretty O
close O
to O
the O
mizzen O
shrouds O
, O
there O
was O
an O
auger O
hole O
, O
bored O
about O
half O
an O
inch O
or O
so O
, O
into O
the O
plank O
. O
His O
bone O
leg O
steadied O
in O
that O
hole O
; O
one O
arm O
elevated O
, O
and O
holding O
by O
a O
shroud O
; O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
stood O
erect O
, O
looking O
straight O
out O
beyond O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
ever-pitching O
prow O
. O
There O
was O
an O
infinity O
of O
firmest O
fortitude O
, O
a O
determinate O
, O
unsurrenderable O
wilfulness O
, O
in O
the O
fixed O
and O
fearless O
, O
forward O
dedication O
of O
that O
glance O
. O
Not O
a O
word O
he O
spoke O
; O
nor O
did O
his O
officers O
say O
aught O
to O
him O
; O
though O
by O
all O
their O
minutest O
gestures O
and O
expressions O
, O
they O
plainly O
showed O
the O
uneasy O
, O
if O
not O
painful O
, O
consciousness O
of O
being O
under O
a O
troubled O
master-eye O
. O
And O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
moody O
stricken O
Ahab B-CHR
stood O
before O
them O
with O
a O
crucifixion O
in O
his O
face O
; O
in O
all O
the O
nameless O
regal O
overbearing O
dignity O
of O
some O
mighty O
woe O
. O
Ere O
long O
, O
from O
his O
first O
visit O
in O
the O
air O
, O
he O
withdrew O
into O
his O
cabin O
. O
But O
after O
that O
morning O
, O
he O
was O
every O
day O
visible O
to O
the O
crew O
; O
either O
standing O
in O
his O
pivot-hole O
, O
or O
seated O
upon O
an O
ivory O
stool O
he O
had O
; O
or O
heavily O
walking O
the O
deck O
. O
As O
the O
sky O
grew O
less O
gloomy O
; O
indeed O
, O
began O
to O
grow O
a O
little O
genial O
, O
he O
became O
still O
less O
and O
less O
a O
recluse O
; O
as O
if O
, O
when O
the O
ship O
had O
sailed O
from O
home O
, O
nothing O
but O
the O
dead O
wintry O
bleakness O
of O
the O
sea O
had O
then O
kept O
him O
so O
secluded O
. O
And O
, O
by O
and O
by O
, O
it O
came O
to O
pass O
, O
that O
he O
was O
almost O
continually O
in O
the O
air O
; O
but O
, O
as O
yet O
, O
for O
all O
that O
he O
said O
, O
or O
perceptibly O
did O
, O
on O
the O
at O
last O
sunny O
deck O
, O
he O
seemed O
as O
unnecessary O
there O
as O
another O
mast O
. O
But O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
only O
making O
a O
passage O
now O
; O
not O
regularly O
cruising O
; O
nearly O
all O
whaling O
preparatives O
needing O
supervision O
the O
mates O
were O
fully O
competent O
to O
, O
so O
that O
there O
was O
little O
or O
nothing O
, O
out O
of O
himself O
, O
to O
employ O
or O
excite O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
now O
; O
and O
thus O
chase O
away O
, O
for O
that O
one O
interval O
, O
the O
clouds O
that O
layer O
upon O
layer O
were O
piled O
upon O
his O
brow O
, O
as O
ever O
all O
clouds O
choose O
the O
loftiest O
peaks O
to O
pile O
themselves O
upon O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
ere O
long O
, O
the O
warm O
, O
warbling O
persuasiveness O
of O
the O
pleasant O
, O
holiday O
weather O
we O
came O
to O
, O
seemed O
gradually O
to O
charm O
him O
from O
his O
mood O
. O
For O
, O
as O
when O
the O
red-cheeked O
, O
dancing O
girls O
, O
April O
and O
May O
, O
trip O
home O
to O
the O
wintry O
, O
misanthropic O
woods O
; O
even O
the O
barest O
, O
ruggedest O
, O
most O
thunder-cloven O
old O
oak O
will O
at O
least O
send O
forth O
some O
few O
green O
sprouts O
, O
to O
welcome O
such O
glad-hearted O
visitants O
; O
so O
Ahab B-CHR
did O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
a O
little O
respond O
to O
the O
playful O
allurings O
of O
that O
girlish O
