It O
is O
noon O
; O
and O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
, O
the O
steward O
, O
thrusting O
his O
pale O
loaf-of-bread O
face O
from O
the O
cabin-scuttle O
, O
announces O
dinner O
to O
his O
lord O
and O
master O
; O
who O
, O
sitting O
in O
the O
lee O
quarter-boat O
, O
has O
just O
been O
taking O
an O
observation O
of O
the O
sun O
; O
and O
is O
now O
mutely O
reckoning O
the O
latitude O
on O
the O
smooth O
, O
medallion-shaped O
tablet O
, O
reserved O
for O
that O
daily O
purpose O
on O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
his O
ivory O
leg O
. O
From O
his O
complete O
inattention O
to O
the O
tidings O
, O
you O
would O
think O
that O
moody O
Ahab B-CHR
had O
not O
heard O
his O
menial O
. O
But O
presently O
, O
catching O
hold O
of O
the O
mizen O
shrouds O
, O
he O
swings O
himself O
to O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
in O
an O
even O
, O
unexhilarated O
voice O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
Dinner O
, O
Mr. B-CHR
Starbuck I-CHR
, O
” O
disappears O
into O
the O
cabin O
. O
When O
the O
last O
echo O
of O
his O
sultan O
’ O
s O
step O
has O
died O
away O
, O
and O
Starbuck B-CHR
, O
the O
first O
Emir O
, O
has O
every O
reason O
to O
suppose O
that O
he O
is O
seated O
, O
then O
Starbuck B-CHR
rouses O
from O
his O
quietude O
, O
takes O
a O
few O
turns O
along O
the O
planks O
, O
and O
, O
after O
a O
grave O
peep O
into O
the O
binnacle O
, O
says O
, O
with O
some O
touch O
of O
pleasantness O
, O
“ O
Dinner O
, O
Mr. B-CHR
Stubb I-CHR
, O
” O
and O
descends O
the O
scuttle O
. O
The O
second O
Emir O
lounges O
about O
the O
rigging O
awhile O
, O
and O
then O
slightly O
shaking O
the O
main O
brace O
, O
to O
see O
whether O
it O
will O
be O
all O
right O
with O
that O
important O
rope O
, O
he O
likewise O
takes O
up O
the O
old O
burden O
, O
and O
with O
a O
rapid O
“ O
Dinner O
, O
Mr. B-CHR
Flask I-CHR
, O
” O
follows O
after O
his O
predecessors O
. O
But O
the O
third O
Emir O
, O
now O
seeing O
himself O
all O
alone O
on O
the O
quarter-deck O
, O
seems O
to O
feel O
relieved O
from O
some O
curious O
restraint O
; O
for O
, O
tipping O
all O
sorts O
of O
knowing O
winks O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
directions O
, O
and O
kicking O
off O
his O
shoes O
, O
he O
strikes O
into O
a O
sharp O
but O
noiseless O
squall O
of O
a O
hornpipe O
right O
over O
the O
Grand O
Turk O
’ O
s O
head O
; O
and O
then O
, O
by O
a O
dexterous O
sleight O
, O
pitching O
his O
cap O
up O
into O
the O
mizentop O
for O
a O
shelf O
, O
he O
goes O
down O
rollicking O
so O
far O
at O
least O
as O
he O
remains O
visible O
from O
the O
deck O
, O
reversing O
all O
other O
processions O
, O
by O
bringing O
up O
the O
rear O
with O
music O
. O
But O
ere O
stepping O
into O
the O
cabin O
doorway O
below O
, O
he O
pauses O
, O
ships O
a O
new O
face O
altogether O
, O
and O
, O
then O
, O
independent O
, O
hilarious O
little O
Flask B-CHR
enters O
King B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
’ O
s O
presence O
, O
in O
the O
character O
of O
Abjectus B-CHR
, O
or O
the O
Slave O
. O
It O
is O
not O
the O
least O
among O
the O
strange O
things O
bred O
by O
the O
intense O
artificialness O
of O
sea-usages O
, O
that O
while O
in O
the O
open O
air O
of O
the O
deck O
some O
officers O
will O
, O
upon O
provocation O
, O
bear O
themselves O
boldly O
and O
defyingly O
enough O
towards O
their O
commander O
; O
yet O
, O
ten O
to O
one O
, O
let O
those O
very O
officers O
the O
next O
moment O
go O
down O
to O
their O
customary O
dinner O
in O
that O
same O
commander O
’ O
s O
cabin O
, O
and O
straightway O
their O
inoffensive O
, O
not O
to O
say O
deprecatory O
and O
humble O
air O
towards O
him O
, O
as O
he O
sits O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
table O
; O
this O
is O
marvellous O
, O
sometimes O
most O
comical O
. O
Wherefore O
this O
difference O
? O
A O
problem O
? O
Perhaps O
not O
. O
To O
have O
been O
Belshazzar B-CHR
, O
King O
of O
Babylon B-ORG
; O
and O
to O
have O
been O
Belshazzar B-CHR
, O
not O
haughtily O
but O
courteously O
, O
therein O
certainly O
must O
have O
been O
some O
touch O
of O
mundane O
grandeur O
. O
But O
he O
who O
in O
the O
rightly O
regal O
and O
intelligent O
spirit O
presides O
over O
his O
own O
private O
dinner-table O
of O
invited O
guests O
, O
that O
man O
’ O
s O
unchallenged O
power O
and O
dominion O
of O
individual O
influence O
for O
the O
time O
; O
that O
man O
’ O
s O
royalty O
of O
state O
transcends O
Belshazzar B-CHR
’ O
s O
, O
for O
Belshazzar B-CHR
was O
not O
the O
greatest O
. O
Who O
has O
but O
once O
dined O
his O
friends O
, O
has O
tasted O
what O
it O
is O
to O
be O
Cæsar B-CHR
. O
It O
is O
a O
witchery O
of O
social O
czarship O
which O
there O
is O
no O
withstanding O
. O
Now O
, O
if O
to O
this O
consideration O
you O
superadd O
the O
official O
supremacy O
of O
a O
ship-master O
, O
then O
, O
by O
inference O
, O
you O
will O
derive O
the O
cause O
of O
that O
peculiarity O
of O
sea-life O
just O
mentioned O
. O
Over O
his O
ivory-inlaid O
table O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
presided O
like O
a O
mute O
, O
maned O
sea-lion O
on O
the O
white O
coral O
beach O
, O
surrounded O
by O
his O
warlike O
but O
still O
deferential O
cubs O
. O
In O
his O
own O
proper O
turn O
, O
each O
officer O
waited O
to O
be O
served O
. O
They O
were O
as O
little O
children O
before O
Ahab B-CHR
; O
and O
yet O
, O
in O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
there O
seemed O
not O
to O
lurk O
the O
smallest O
social O
arrogance O
. O
With O
one O
mind O
, O
their O
intent O
eyes O
all O
fastened O
upon O
the O
old O
man O
’ O
s O
knife O
, O
as O
he O
carved O
the O
chief O
dish O
before O
him O
. O
I O
do O
not O
suppose O
that O
for O
the O
world O
they O
would O
have O
profaned O
that O
moment O
with O
the O
slightest O
observation O
, O
even O
upon O
so O
neutral O
a O
topic O
as O
the O
weather O
. O
No O
! O
And O
when O
reaching O
out O
his O
knife O
and O
fork O
, O
between O
which O
the O
slice O
of O
beef O
was O
locked O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
thereby O
motioned O
Starbuck B-CHR
’ O
s O
plate O
towards O
him O
, O
the O
mate O
received O
his O
meat O
as O
though O
receiving O
alms O
; O
and O
cut O
it O
tenderly O
; O
and O
a O
little O
started O
if O
, O
perchance O
, O
the O
knife O
grazed O
against O
the O
plate O
; O
and O
chewed O
it O
noiselessly O
; O
and O
swallowed O
it O
, O
not O
without O
circumspection O
. O
For O
, O
like O
the O
Coronation O
banquet O
at O
Frankfort B-LOC
, O
where O
the O
German B-GRP
Emperor O
profoundly O
dines O
with O
the O
seven O
Imperial O
Electors O
, O
so O
these O
cabin O
meals O
were O
somehow O
solemn O
meals O
, O
eaten O
in O
awful O
silence O
; O
and O
yet O
at O
table O
old O
Ahab B-CHR
forbade O
not O
conversation O
; O
only O
he O
himself O
was O
dumb O
. O
What O
a O
relief O
it O
was O
to O
choking O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
when O
a O
rat O
made O
a O
sudden O
racket O
in O
the O
hold O
below O
. O
And O
poor O
little O
Flask B-CHR
, O
he O
was O
the O
youngest O
son O
, O
and O
little O
boy O
of O
this O
weary O
family O
party O
. O
His O
were O
the O
shinbones O
of O
the O
saline O
beef O
; O
his O
would O
have O
been O
the O
drumsticks O
. O
For O
Flask B-CHR
to O
have O
presumed O
to O
help O
himself O
, O
this O
must O
have O
seemed O
to O
him O
tantamount O
to O
larceny O
in O
the O
first O
degree O
. O
Had O
he O
helped O
himself O
at O
that O
table O
, O
doubtless O
, O
never O
more O
would O
he O
have O
been O
able O
to O
hold O
his O
head O
up O
in O
this O
honest O
world O
; O
nevertheless O
, O
strange O
to O
say O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
never O
forbade O
him O
. O
And O
had O
Flask B-CHR
helped O
himself O
, O
the O
chances O
were O
Ahab B-CHR
had O
never O
so O
much O
as O
noticed O
it O
. O
Least O
of O
all O
, O
did O
Flask B-CHR
presume O
to O
help O
himself O
to O
butter O
. O
Whether O
he O
thought O
the O
owners O
of O
the O
ship O
denied O
it O
to O
him O
, O
on O
account O
of O
its O
clotting O
his O
clear O
, O
sunny O
complexion O
; O
or O
whether O
he O
deemed O
that O
, O
on O
so O
long O
a O
voyage O
in O
such O
marketless O
waters O
, O
butter O
was O
at O
a O
premium O
, O
and O
therefore O
was O
not O
for O
him O
, O
a O
subaltern O
; O
however O
it O
was O
, O
Flask B-CHR
, O
alas O
! O
was O
a O
butterless O
man O
! O
Another O
thing O
. O
Flask B-CHR
was O
the O
last O
person O
down O
at O
the O
dinner O
, O
and O
Flask B-CHR
is O
the O
first O
man O
up O
. O
Consider O
! O
For O
hereby O
Flask B-CHR
’ O
s O
dinner O
was O
badly O
jammed O
in O
point O
of O
time O
. O
Starbuck B-CHR
and O
Stubb B-CHR
both O
had O
the O
start O
of O
him O
; O
and O
yet O
they O
also O
have O
the O
privilege O
of O
lounging O
in O
the O
rear O
. O
If O
Stubb B-CHR
even O
, O
who O
is O
but O
a O
peg O
higher O
than O
Flask B-CHR
, O
happens O
to O
have O
but O
a O
small O
appetite O
, O
and O
soon O
shows O
symptoms O
of O
concluding O
his O
repast O
, O
then O
Flask B-CHR
must O
bestir O
himself O
, O
he O
will O
not O
get O
more O
than O
three O
mouthfuls O
that O
day O
; O
for O
it O
is O
against O
holy O
usage O
for O
Stubb B-CHR
to O
precede O
Flask B-CHR
to O
the O
deck O
. O
Therefore O
it O
was O
that O
Flask B-CHR
once O
admitted O
in O
private O
, O
that O
ever O
since O
he O
had O
arisen O
to O
the O
dignity O
of O
an O
officer O
, O
from O
that O
moment O
he O
had O
never O
known O
what O
it O
was O
to O
be O
otherwise O
than O
hungry O
, O
more O
or O
less O
. O
For O
what O
he O
ate O
did O
not O
so O
much O
relieve O
his O
hunger O
, O
as O
keep O
it O
immortal O
in O
him O
. O
Peace O
and O
satisfaction O
, O
thought O
Flask B-CHR
, O
have O
for O
ever O
departed O
from O
my O
stomach O
. O
I O
am O
an O
officer O
; O
but O
, O
how O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
fish O
a O
bit O
of O
old-fashioned O
beef O
in O
the O
forecastle O
, O
as O
I O
used O
to O
when O
I O
was O
before O
the O
mast O
. O
There O
’ O
s O
the O
fruits O
of O
promotion O
now O
; O
there O
’ O
s O
the O
vanity O
of O
glory O
: O
there O
’ O
s O
the O
insanity O
of O
life O
! O
Besides O
, O
if O
it O
were O
so O
that O
any O
mere O
sailor O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
had O
a O
grudge O
against O
Flask B-CHR
in O
Flask B-CHR
’ O
s O
official O
capacity O
, O
all O
that O
sailor O
had O
to O
do O
, O
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
ample O
vengeance O
, O
was O
to O
go O
aft O
at O
dinner-time O
, O
and O
get O
a O
peep O
at O
Flask B-CHR
through O
the O
cabin O
sky-light O
, O
sitting O
silly O
and O
dumfoundered O
before O
awful O
Ahab B-CHR
. O
Now O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
and O
his O
three O
mates O
formed O
what O
may O
be O
called O
the O
first O
table O
in O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
cabin O
. O
After O
their O
departure O
, O
taking O
place O
in O
inverted O
order O
to O
their O
arrival O
, O
the O
canvas O
cloth O
was O
cleared O
, O
or O
rather O
was O
restored O
to O
some O
hurried O
order O
by O
the O
pallid O
steward O
. O
And O
then O
the O
three O
harpooneers O
were O
bidden O
to O
the O
feast O
, O
they O
being O
its O
residuary O
legatees O
. O
They O
made O
a O
sort O
of O
temporary O
servants O
’ O
hall O
of O
the O
high O
and O
mighty O
cabin O
. O
In O
strange O
contrast O
to O
the O
hardly O
tolerable O
constraint O
and O
nameless O
invisible O
domineerings O
of O
the O
captain O
’ O
s O
table O
, O
was O
the O
entire O
care-free O
license O
and O
ease O
, O
the O
almost O
frantic O
democracy O
of O
those O
inferior O
fellows O
the O
harpooneers O
. O
While O
their O
masters O
, O
the O
mates O
, O
seemed O
afraid O
of O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
hinges O
of O
their O
own O
jaws O
, O
the O
harpooneers O
chewed O
their O
food O
with O
such O
a O
relish O
that O
there O
was O
a O
report O
to O
it O
. O
They O
dined O
like O
lords O
; O
they O
filled O
their O
bellies O
like O
Indian B-GRP
ships O
all O
day O
loading O
with O
spices O
. O
Such O
portentous O
appetites O
had O
Queequeg B-CHR
and O
Tashtego B-CHR
, O
that O
to O
fill O
out O
the O
vacancies O
made O
by O
the O
previous O
repast O
, O
often O
the O
pale O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
was O
fain O
to O
bring O
on O
a O
great O
baron O
of O
salt-junk O
, O
seemingly O
quarried O
out O
of O
the O
solid O
ox O
. O
And O
if O
he O
were O
not O
lively O
about O
it O
, O
if O
he O
did O
not O
go O
with O
a O
nimble O
hop-skip-and-jump O
, O
then O
Tashtego B-CHR
had O
an O
ungentlemanly O
way O
of O
accelerating O
him O
by O
darting O
a O
fork O
at O
his O
back O
, O
harpoon-wise O
. O
And O
once O
Daggoo B-CHR
, O
seized O
with O
a O
sudden O
humor O
, O
assisted O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
’ O
s O
memory O
by O
snatching O
him O
up O
bodily O
, O
and O
thrusting O
his O
head O
into O
a O
great O
empty O
wooden O
trencher O
, O
while O
Tashtego B-CHR
, O
knife O
in O
hand O
, O
began O
laying O
out O
the O
circle O
preliminary O
to O
scalping O
him O
. O
He O
was O
naturally O
a O
very O
nervous O
, O
shuddering O
sort O
of O
little O
fellow O
, O
this O
bread-faced O
steward O
; O
the O
progeny O
of O
a O
bankrupt O
baker O
and O
a O
hospital O
nurse O
. O
And O
what O
with O
the O
standing O
spectacle O
of O
the O
black O
terrific O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
and O
the O
periodical O
tumultuous O
visitations O
of O
these O
three O
savages O
, O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
’ O
s O
whole O
life O
was O
one O
continual O
lip-quiver O
. O
Commonly O
, O
after O
seeing O
the O
harpooneers O
furnished O
with O
all O
things O
they O
demanded O
, O
he O
would O
escape O
from O
their O
clutches O
into O
his O
little O
pantry O
adjoining O
, O
and O
fearfully O
peep O
out O
at O
them O
through O
the O
blinds O
of O
its O
door O
, O
till O
all O
was O
over O
. O
It O
was O
a O
sight O
to O
see O
Queequeg B-CHR
seated O
over O
against O
Tashtego B-CHR
, O
opposing O
his O
filed O
teeth O
to O
the O
Indian B-GRP
’ O
s O
: O
crosswise O
to O
them O
, O
Daggoo B-CHR
seated O
on O
the O
floor O
, O
for O
a O
bench O
would O
have O
brought O
his O
hearse-plumed O
head O
to O
the O
low O
carlines O
; O
at O
every O
motion O
of O
his O
colossal O
limbs O
, O
making O
the O
low O
cabin O
framework O
to O
shake O
, O
as O
when O
an O
African B-GRP
elephant O
goes O
passenger O
in O
a O
ship O
. O
But O
for O
all O
this O
, O
the O
great O
negro O
was O
wonderfully O
abstemious O
, O
not O
to O
say O
dainty O
. O
It O
seemed O
hardly O
possible O
that O
by O
such O
comparatively O
small O
mouthfuls O
he O
could O
keep O
up O
the O
vitality O
diffused O
through O
so O
broad O
, O
baronial O
, O
and O
superb O
a O
person O
. O
But O
, O
doubtless O
, O
this O
noble O
savage O
fed O
strong O
and O
drank O
deep O
of O
the O
abounding O
element O
of O
air O
; O
and O
through O
his O
dilated O
nostrils O
snuffed O
in O
the O
sublime O
life O
of O
the O
worlds O
. O
Not O
by O
beef O
or O
by O
bread O
, O
are O
giants O
made O
or O
nourished O
. O
But O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
he O
had O
a O
mortal O
, O
barbaric O
smack O
of O
the O
lip O
in O
eating—an O
ugly O
sound O
enough—so O
much O
so O
, O
that O
the O
trembling O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
almost O
looked O
to O
see O
whether O
any O
marks O
of O
teeth O
lurked O
in O
his O
own O
lean O
arms O
. O
And O
when O
he O
would O
hear O
Tashtego B-CHR
singing O
out O
for O
him O
to O
produce O
himself O
, O
that O
his O
bones O
might O
be O
picked O
, O
the O
simple-witted O
steward O
all O
but O
shattered O
the O
crockery O
hanging O
round O
him O
in O
the O
pantry O
, O
by O
his O
sudden O
fits O
of O
the O
palsy O
. O
Nor O
did O
the O
whetstone O
which O
the O
harpooneers O
carried O
in O
their O
pockets O
, O
for O
their O
lances O
and O
other O
weapons O
; O
and O
with O
which O
whetstones O
, O
at O
dinner O
, O
they O
would O
ostentatiously O
sharpen O
their O
knives O
; O
that O
grating O
sound O
did O
not O
at O
all O
tend O
to O
tranquillize O
poor O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
. O
How O
could O
he O
forget O
that O
in O
his O
Island O
days O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
for O
one O
, O
must O
certainly O
have O
been O
guilty O
of O
some O
murderous O
, O
convivial O
indiscretions O
. O
Alas O
! O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
! O
hard O
fares O
the O
white O
waiter O
who O
waits O
upon O
cannibals O
. O
Not O
a O
napkin O
should O
he O
carry O
on O
his O
arm O
, O
but O
a O
buckler O
. O
In O
good O
time O
, O
though O
, O
to O
his O
great O
delight O
, O
the O
three O
salt-sea O
warriors O
would O
rise O
and O
depart O
; O
to O
his O
credulous O
, O
fable-mongering O
ears O
, O
all O
their O
martial O
bones O
jingling O
in O
them O
at O
every O
step O
, O
like O
Moorish B-GRP
scimetars O
in O
scabbards O
. O
But O
, O
though O
these O
barbarians O
dined O
in O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
nominally O
lived O
there O
; O
still O
, O
being O
anything O
but O
sedentary O
in O
their O
habits O
, O
they O
were O
scarcely O
ever O
in O
it O
except O
at O
mealtimes O
, O
and O
just O
before O
sleeping-time O
, O
when O
they O
passed O
through O
it O
to O
their O
own O
peculiar O
quarters O
. O
In O
this O
one O
matter O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
seemed O
no O
exception O
to O
most O
American B-GRP
whale O
captains O
, O
who O
, O
as O
a O
set O
, O
rather O
incline O
to O
the O
opinion O
that O
by O
rights O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
cabin O
belongs O
to O
them O
; O
and O
that O
it O
is O
by O
courtesy O
alone O
that O
anybody O
else O
is O
, O
at O
any O
time O
, O
permitted O
there O
. O
So O
that O
, O
in O
real O
truth O
, O
the O
mates O
and O
harpooneers O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
might O
more O
properly O
be O
said O
to O
have O
lived O
out O
of O
the O
cabin O
than O
in O
it O
. O
For O
when O
they O
did O
enter O
it O
, O
it O
was O
something O
as O
a O
street-door O
enters O
a O
house O
; O
turning O
inwards O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
only O
to O
be O
turned O
out O
the O
next O
; O
and O
, O
as O
a O
permanent O
thing O
, O
residing O
in O
the O
open O
air O
. O
Nor O
did O
they O
lose O
much O
hereby O
; O
in O
the O
cabin O
was O
no O
companionship O
; O
socially O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
was O
inaccessible O
. O
Though O
nominally O
included O
in O
the O
census O
of O
Christendom B-GRP
, O
he O
was O
still O
an O
alien O
to O
it O
. O
He O
lived O
in O
the O
world O
, O
as O
the O
last O
of O
the O
Grisly O
Bears O
lived O
in O
settled O
Missouri B-LOC
. O
And O
as O
when O
Spring O
and O
Summer O
had O
departed O
, O
that O
wild O
Logan B-CHR
of O
the O
woods O
, O
burying O
himself O
in O
the O
hollow O
of O
a O
tree O
, O
lived O
out O
the O
winter O
there O
, O
sucking O
his O
own O
paws O
; O
so O
, O
in O
his O
inclement O
, O
howling O
old O
age O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
soul O
, O
shut O
up O
in O
the O
caved O
trunk O
of O
his O
body O
, O
there O
fed O
upon O
the O
sullen O
paws O
of O
its O
gloom O
