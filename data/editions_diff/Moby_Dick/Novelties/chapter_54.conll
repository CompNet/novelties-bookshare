much O
like O
some O
noted O
four O
corners O
of O

great O
highway O

where O
you O
meet O
more O

It O
was O
not O
very O
long O
after O
speaking O

Goney B-MSC

another O
homeward-bound O
whaleman O

* O
was O
encountered O

manned O
almost O
wholly O
by O
Polynesians B-GRP

In O
the O
short O
gam O
that O
ensued O
she O
gave O
us O
strong O
news O
of O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
. O
To O
some O
the O
general O
interest O
in O
the O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
was O
now O
wildly O
heightened O
by O
a O
circumstance O
of O
the O
Town-Ho B-MSC
’ O
s O
story O
, O
which O
seemed O
obscurely O
to O
involve O
with O
the O
whale O
a O
certain O
wondrous O
, O
inverted O
visitation O
of O
one O
of O
those O
so O
called O
judgments O
of O
God B-CHR
which O
at O
times O
are O
said O
to O
overtake O
some O
men O
. O
This O
latter O
circumstance O
, O
with O
its O
own O
particular O
accompaniments O
, O
forming O
what O
may O
be O
called O
the O
secret O
part O
of O
the O
tragedy O
about O
to O
be O
narrated O
, O
never O
reached O
the O
ears O
of O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
or O
his O
mates O
. O
For O
that O
secret O
part O
of O
the O
story O
was O
unknown O
to O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
Town-Ho B-MSC
himself O
. O
It O
was O
the O
private O
property O
of O
three O
confederate O
white O
seamen O
of O
that O
ship O
, O
one O
of O
whom O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
communicated O
it O
to O
Tashtego B-CHR
with O
Romish B-GRP
injunctions O
of O
secrecy O
, O
but O
the O
following O
night O
Tashtego B-CHR
rambled O
in O
his O
sleep O
, O
and O
revealed O
so O
much O
of O
it O
in O
that O
way O
, O
that O
when O
he O
was O
wakened O
he O
could O
not O
well O
withhold O
the O
rest O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
so O
potent O
an O
influence O
did O
this O
thing O
have O
on O
those O
seamen O
in O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
who O
came O
to O
the O
full O
knowledge O
of O
it O
, O
and O
by O
such O
a O
strange O
delicacy O
, O
to O
call O
it O
so O
, O
were O
they O
governed O
in O
this O
matter O
, O
that O
they O
kept O
the O
secret O
among O
themselves O
so O
that O
it O
never O
transpired O
abaft O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
main-mast O
. O
Interweaving O
in O
its O
proper O
place O
this O
darker O
thread O
with O
the O
story O
as O
publicly O
narrated O
on O
the O
ship O
, O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
strange O
affair O
I O
now O
proceed O
to O
put O
on O
lasting O
record O
. O
* O
The O
ancient O
whale-cry O
upon O
first O
sighting O
a O
whale O
from O
the O
mast-head O
, O
still O
used O
by O
whalemen O
in O
hunting O

famous O
Gallipagos B-LOC

For O
my O
humor O

s O
sake O
, O
I O
shall O
preserve O
the O
style O
in O
which O
I O
once O
narrated O
it O
at O
Lima B-LOC

to O

lounging O
circle O
of O

were O
on O
the O
closer O
terms O
with O
me O
; O
and O
hence O
the O
interluding O
questions O
they O
occasionally O
put O
, O
and O
which O
are O
duly O
answered O
at O
the O
time O
. O
“ O
Some O
two O
years O
prior O
to O
my O
first O
learning O
the O
events O
which O
I O
am O
about O
rehearsing O
to O
you O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
the O
Town-Ho B-MSC
, O
Sperm O
Whaler O
of O
Nantucket B-LOC
, O
was O
cruising O
in O
your O
Pacific B-LOC
here O
, O
not O
very O
many O
days O
’ O
sail O
eastward O
from O
the O
eaves O
of O
this O
good O
Golden B-LOC
Inn I-LOC
. O
She O
was O
somewhere O
to O
the O
northward O
of O
the O
Line B-LOC
. O
One O
morning O
upon O
handling O
the O
pumps O
, O
according O
to O
daily O
usage O
, O
it O
was O
observed O
that O
she O
made O
more O
water O
in O
her O
hold O
than O
common O
. O
They O
supposed O
a O
sword-fish O
had O
stabbed O
her O
, O
gentlemen O
. O
But O
the O
captain O
, O
having O
some O
unusual O
reason O
for O
believing O
that O
rare O
good O
luck O
awaited O
him O
in O
those O
latitudes O
; O
and O
therefore O
being O
very O
averse O
to O
quit O
them O
, O
and O
the O
leak O
not O
being O
then O
considered O
at O
all O
dangerous O
, O
though O
, O
indeed O
, O
they O
could O
not O
find O
it O
after O
searching O
the O
hold O
as O
low O
down O
as O
was O
possible O
in O
rather O
heavy O
weather O
, O
the O
ship O
still O
continued O
her O
cruisings O
, O
the O
mariners O
working O
at O
the O
pumps O
at O
wide O
and O
easy O
intervals O
; O
but O
no O
good O
luck O
came O
; O
more O
days O
went O
by O
, O
and O
not O
only O
was O
the O
leak O
yet O
undiscovered O
, O
but O
it O
sensibly O
increased O
. O
So O
much O
so O
, O
that O
now O
taking O
some O
alarm O
, O
the O
captain O
, O
making O
all O
sail O
, O
stood O
away O
for O
the O
nearest O
harbor O
among O
the O
islands O
, O
there O
to O
have O
his O
hull O
hove O
out O
and O
repaired O
. O
“ O
Though O
no O
small O
passage O
was O
before O
her O
, O
yet O
, O
if O
the O
commonest O
chance O
favoured O
, O
he O
did O
not O
at O
all O
fear O
that O
his O
ship O
would O
founder O
by O
the O
way O
, O
because O
his O
pumps O
were O
of O
the O
best O
, O
and O
being O
periodically O
relieved O
at O
them O
, O
those O
six-and-thirty O
men O
of O
his O
could O
easily O
keep O
the O
ship O
free O
; O
never O
mind O
if O
the O
leak O
should O
double O
on O
her O
. O
In O
truth O
, O
well O
nigh O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
passage O
being O
attended O
by O
very O
prosperous O
breezes O
, O
the O
Town-Ho B-MSC
had O
all O
but O
certainly O
arrived O
in O
perfect O
safety O
at O
her O
port O
without O
the O
occurrence O
of O
the O
least O
fatality O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O
brutal O
overbearing O
of O
Radney B-CHR
, O
the O
mate O
, O
a O
Vineyarder B-GRP

the O
bitterly O

vengeance O

require O
an O
hour O

more O

would O
never O
again O
remember O
it O
, O
on O
account O
of O
all O
hands O
gently O
subsiding O
to O
the O
bottom O
. O
Nor O
in O
the O
solitary O
and O
savage O
seas O
far O
from O
you O
to O
the O
westward O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
is O
it O
altogether O
unusual O
for O
ships O
to O
keep O
clanging O
at O
their O
pump-handles O
in O
full O
chorus O
even O
for O
a O
voyage O
of O
considerable O
length O
; O
that O
is O
, O
if O
it O
lie O
along O
a O
tolerably O
accessible O
coast O
, O
or O
if O
any O
other O
reasonable O
retreat O
is O
afforded O
them O
. O
It O
is O
only O
when O
a O
leaky O
vessel O
is O
in O
some O
very O
out O
of O
the O
way O
part O
of O
those O
waters O
, O
some O
really O
landless O
latitude O
, O
that O
her O
captain O
begins O
to O
feel O
a O
little O
anxious O
. O
“ O
Much O
this O
way O
had O
it O
been O
with O
the O
Town-Ho B-MSC
; O
so O
when O
her O
leak O
was O
found O
gaining O
once O
more O
, O
there O
was O
in O
truth O
some O
small O
concern O
manifested O
by O
several O
of O
her O
company O
; O
especially O
by O
Radney B-CHR
the O
mate O
. O
He O
commanded O
the O
upper O
sails O
to O
be O
well O
hoisted O
, O
sheeted O
home O
anew O
, O
and O
every O
way O
expanded O
to O
the O
breeze O
. O
Now O
this O
Radney B-CHR
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
was O
as O
little O
of O
a O
coward O
, O
and O
as O
little O
inclined O
to O
any O
sort O
of O
nervous O
apprehensiveness O
touching O
his O
own O
person O
as O
any O
fearless O
, O
unthinking O
creature O
on O
land O
or O
on O
sea O
that O
you O
can O
conveniently O
imagine O
, O
gentlemen O
. O
Therefore O
when O
he O
betrayed O
this O
solicitude O
about O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
some O
of O
the O
seamen O
declared O
that O
it O
was O
only O
on O
account O
of O
his O
being O
a O
part O
owner O
in O
her O
. O
So O
when O
they O
were O
working O
that O
evening O
at O
the O
pumps O
, O
there O
was O
on O
this O
head O
no O
small O
gamesomeness O
slily O
going O
on O
among O
them O
, O
as O
they O
stood O
with O
their O
feet O
continually O
overflowed O
by O
the O
rippling O
clear O
water O
; O
clear O
as O
any O
mountain O
spring O
, O
gentlemen—that O
bubbling O
from O
the O
pumps O
ran O
across O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
poured O
itself O
out O
in O
steady O
spouts O
at O
the O
lee O
scupper-holes O
. O
“ O
Now O
, O
as O
you O
well O
know O
, O
it O
is O
not O
seldom O
the O
case O
in O
this O
conventional O
world O
of O
ours—watery O
or O
otherwise O
; O
that O
when O
a O
person O
placed O
in O
command O
over O
his O
fellow-men O
finds O
one O
of O
them O
to O
be O
very O
significantly O
his O
superior O
in O
general O
pride O
of O
manhood O
, O
straightway O
against O
that O
man O
he O
conceives O
an O
unconquerable O
dislike O
and O
bitterness O
; O
and O
if O
he O
have O
a O
chance O
he O
will O
pull O
down O

pulverize O

it O
may O

so O
it O
happened O

Intolerably O
striding O
along O

down O
the O

also O
a O

“ O
Now O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
sweeping O
a O
ship O
’ O

deck O
at O

a O
piece O
of O
household O
work O
which O
in O
all O
times O
but O
raging O
gales O
is O
regularly O
attended O
to O
every O
evening O
; O
it O
has O
been O
known O
to O
be O
done O
in O
the O
case O
of O
ships O
actually O
foundering O
at O
the O
time O
. O
Such O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
is O
the O
inflexibility O
of O
sea-usages O
and O
the O
instinctive O
love O
of O
neatness O
in O
seamen O
; O
some O
of O
whom O
would O
not O
willingly O
drown O
without O
first O
washing O
their O
faces O

But O
in O
all O
vessels O
this O
broom O
business O
is O
the O
prescriptive O
province O
of O
the O
boys O
, O
if O

being O
the O
most O

Steelkilt B-CHR
had O
been O
regularly O

he O
should O

being O
the O

I O
mention O
all O
these O
particulars O
so O
that O
you O
may O

stood O
between O

But O
there O
was O
more O
than O
this O
: O
the O
order O
about O
the O

was O
almost O
as O
plainly O
meant O
to O
sting O

insult O

as O

Any O
man O

all O
this O

doubtless O
much O
more O
, O
the O
Lakeman B-GRP
fully O
comprehended O
when O

uttered O
his O

sat O
still O
for O
a O
moment O

steadfastly O
looked O

all O

that O
strange O

unwillingness O

stir O
up O
the O
deeper O

it O

to O

And O
in O
this O
way O
the O

went O
once O
slowly O
round O
the O
windlass O
; O
when O
, O
resolved O
at O
last O
no O
longer O
to O
retreat O

bethinking O
him O
that O

had O

comported O
with O
his O
humor O
, O
the O
Lakeman B-GRP
paused O
on O
the O
hatches O
and O
thus O
spoke O
to O
the O
officer O
: O
“ O
‘ O
Mr. B-CHR

, O

not O

that O
hammer O
away O
, O
or O
look O
to O
yourself. O
’ O
But O
the O
predestinated O
mate O
coming O
still O
closer O
to O
him O
, O
where O
the O
Lakeman B-GRP
stood O
fixed O
, O
now O
shook O
the O
heavy O
hammer O
within O
an O
inch O
of O
his O
teeth O
; O
meanwhile O
repeating O
a O
string O
of O
insufferable O
maledictions O
. O
Retreating O
not O
the O
thousandth O
part O
of O
an O
inch O
; O
stabbing O
him O
in O
the O
eye O
with O
the O
unflinching O
poniard O
of O
his O
glance O
, O
Steelkilt B-CHR
, O
clenching O
his O
right O
hand O
behind O
him O
and O
creepingly O
drawing O
it O
back O
, O
told O
his O
persecutor O
that O
if O
the O
hammer O
but O
grazed O
his O
cheek O
he O
( O
Steelkilt B-CHR
) O
would O
murder O
him O
. O
But O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
the O
fool O
had O
been O
branded O
for O
the O
slaughter O
by O
the O
gods O
. O
Immediately O
the O
hammer O
touched O
the O
cheek O
; O
the O
next O
instant O
the O
lower O
jaw O
of O
the O
mate O
was O
stove O
in O
his O
head O
; O
he O
fell O
on O
the O
hatch O
spouting O
blood O
like O
a O
whale O
. O
“ O
Ere O

Steelkilt B-CHR

den O

over O

clinking O

At O
sunrise O
the O
Captain O
went O
forward O

knocking O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
summoned O
the O
prisoners O
to O
work O

with O
a O
yell O
they O
refused O

Water O
was O

lowered O
down O

a O
couple O

again O

it O

quarter-deck O

every O
day O

was O
repeated O

on O
the O
fourth O
morning O
a O
confused O
wrangling O
, O

then O
a O
scuffling O
was O
heard O
, O
as O
the O
customary O
summons O
was O
delivered O
; O

suddenly O
four O
men O
burst O
up O
from O
the O
forecastle O
, O
saying O
they O
were O
ready O

turn O

The O
fetid O
closeness O
of O
the O
air O
, O

a O
famishing O
diet O
, O
united O
perhaps O
to O
some O
fears O
of O
ultimate O
retribution O

had O
constrained O
them O
to O
surrender O

discretion O

Emboldened O
by O
this O

the O
Captain O
reiterated O
his O
demand O
to O
the O
rest O

Steelkilt B-CHR
shouted O
up O
to O
him O
a O
terrific O
hint O
to O
stop O
his O
babbling O

betake O
himself O

he O
belonged O

On O
the O
fifth O
morning O
three O
others O
of O
the O
mutineers O
bolted O
up O
into O
the O
air O
from O
the O
desperate O
arms O
below O

sought O
to O
restrain O
them O

Only O

were O
left O

“ O
‘ O
Better O

the O
Captain O

a O
heartless O
jeer O

“ O
‘ O

up O
again O

“ O
‘ O

point O

defection O
of O
seven O
of O

former O

stung O
by O
the O
mocking O
voice O
that O
had O
last O
hailed O
him O
, O
and O
maddened O
by O
his O
long O
entombment O
in O
a O
place O
as O
black O
as O
the O
bowels O
of O
despair O
; O
it O
was O
then O
that O
Steelkilt B-CHR
proposed O
to O
the O
two O
Canallers B-GRP

thus O
far O
apparently O
of O
one O
mind O
with O
him O

burst O
out O

hole O
at O
the O
next O
summoning O
of O
the O
garrison O

their O
keen O
mincing O

heavy O

run O
amuck O
from O
the O
bowsprit O

the O
taffrail O
; O

if O
by O
any O
devilishness O
of O
desperation O
possible O

seize O
the O
ship O

For O
himself O
, O
he O
would O
do O
this O

he O
said O
, O
whether O

That O
was O
the O
last O
night O

the O
scheme O
met O
with O
no O
opposition O
on O
the O
part O

what O
was O
more O

when O
the O

But O
to O
this O

with O

shifted O

furious O
man O

, O
in O
a O
boat O

now O
his O

was O
, O
to O
beach O

the O
whale O

topmost O
back O

Nothing O
loath O
, O
his O
bowsman O
hauled O
him O
up O

up O
, O
through O
a O
blinding O
foam O
that O
blent O
two O
whitenesses O
together O
; O
till O
of O
a O
sudden O
the O
boat O
struck O
as O
against O
a O
sunken O
ledge O
, O
and O
keeling O
over O
, O
spilled O
out O

fell O
on O

whale O

slippery O
back O

the O

righted O

dashed O
aside O

the O
swell O

was O
tossed O
over O
into O
the O
sea O
, O
on O

He O
struck O
out O
through O
the O
spray O
, O
and O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
was O
dimly O
seen O
through O
that O
veil O

wildly O
seeking O
to O
remove O
himself O
from O
the O
eye O
of O

. O
But O
the O
whale O
rushed O
round O
in O
a O
sudden O
maelstrom O
; O
seized O
the O
swimmer O
between O
his O
jaws O
; O
and O
rearing O
high O
up O
with O
him O
, O
plunged O
headlong O
again O
, O
and O
went O
down O
. O
“ O
Meantime O
, O
at O
the O
first O
tap O
of O
the O
boat O
’ O

bottom O
, O
the O
Lakeman B-GRP

slackened O
the O
line O
, O
so O
as O
to O
drop O
astern O
from O
the O
whirlpool O
; O
calmly O
looking O
on O
, O
he O
thought O
his O
own O
thoughts O
. O
But O
a O
sudden O
, O
terrific O
, O
downward O
jerking O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
quickly O
brought O
his O
knife O
to O
the O
line O
. O
He O
cut O
it O
; O
and O
the O
whale O
was O
free O
. O
But O
, O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
Moby B-CHR

rose O
again O
, O
with O
some O
tatters O
of O

red O
woollen O
shirt O
, O
caught O
in O
the O
teeth O
that O
had O
destroyed O
him O

All O
four O
boats O
gave O
chase O
again O
; O

the O
whale O
eluded O
them O
, O

finally O
wholly O
disappeared O
. O
“ O
In O
good O
time O
, O
the O
Town-Ho B-MSC
reached O
her O
port—a O
savage O

solitary O
place—where O
no O
civilized O

all O

five O

six O
of O

deliberately O
deserted O
among O
the O
palms O

eventually O
, O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
seizing O
a O
large O
double O
war-canoe O
of O
the O
savages O

setting O
sail O
for O
some O

“ O
The O
ship O
’ O

company O
being O
reduced O
to O
but O
a O
handful O
, O
the O
captain O
called O
upon O
the O
Islanders O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
the O
laborious O
business O
of O
heaving O
down O
the O
ship O

stop O

leak O

But O
to O
such O
unresting O
vigilance O
over O
their O
dangerous O
allies O
was O
this O
small O
band O
of O
whites O
necessitated O
, O
both O
by O
night O

by O
day O
, O

so O
extreme O
was O
the O
hard O
work O
they O
underwent O
, O
that O
upon O
the O
vessel O
being O
ready O
again O
for O

were O
in O
such O
a O
weakened O

the O
captain O
durst O
not O
put O
off O
with O
them O
in O
so O
heavy O
a O
vessel O
. O
After O
taking O
counsel O
with O
his O
officers O
, O
he O
anchored O
the O
ship O
as O
far O
off O
shore O
as O
possible O
; O
loaded O
and O
ran O
out O

two O
cannon O
from O

warning O
the O
Islanders O
not O
to O
approach O
the O

at O
their O
peril O
, O
took O
one O
man O
with O
him O
, O
and O
setting O
the O
sail O
of O
his O
best O

straight O
before O

five O

“ O
On O
the O
fourth O
day O
of O
the O

a O
large O
canoe O
was O
descried O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
touched O
at O
a O
low O
isle O
of O
corals O

He O
steered O
away O
from O
it O
; O
but O
the O
savage O
craft O
bore O
down O
on O
him O
; O
and O
soon O
the O
voice O
of O
Steelkilt B-CHR
hailed O
him O
to O
heave O
to O
, O
or O
he O
would O
run O
him O
under O
water O
. O
The O
captain O
presented O
a O
pistol O

With O
one O
foot O
on O
each O
prow O
of O
the O
yoked O

, O
the O
Lakeman B-GRP
laughed O
him O
to O
scorn O
; O
assuring O
him O
that O
if O
the O
pistol O
so O
much O
as O
clicked O
in O
the O
lock O
