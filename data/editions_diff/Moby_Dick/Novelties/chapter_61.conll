If O
to O
Starbuck B-CHR
the O
apparition O
of O
the O
Squid O
was O
a O
thing O
of O
portents O
, O
to O
Queequeg B-CHR
it O
was O
quite O
a O
different O
object O
. O
“ O
When O
you O
see O
him O
’ O
quid O
, O
” O
said O
the O
savage O
, O
honing O
his O
harpoon O
in O
the O
bow O
of O
his O
hoisted O
boat O
, O
“ O
then O
you O
quick O
see O
him O
’ O
parm O
whale O
. O
” O
The O
next O
day O
was O
exceedingly O
still O
and O
sultry O
, O
and O
with O
nothing O
special O
to O
engage O
them O
, O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
crew O
could O
hardly O
resist O
the O
spell O
of O
sleep O
induced O
by O
such O
a O
vacant O
sea O
. O
For O
this O
part O
of O
the O
Indian B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
through O
which O
we O
then O
were O
voyaging O
is O
not O
what O
whalemen O
call O
a O
lively O
ground O
; O
that O
is O
, O
it O
affords O
fewer O
glimpses O
of O
porpoises O
, O
dolphins O
, O
flying-fish O
, O
and O
other O
vivacious O
denizens O
of O
more O
stirring O
waters O
, O
than O
those O
off O
the O
Rio B-LOC
de I-LOC
la I-LOC
Plata I-LOC
, O
or O
the O
in-shore O
ground O
off O
Peru B-LOC
. O
It O
was O
my O
turn O
to O
stand O
at O
the O
foremast-head O
; O
and O
with O
my O
shoulders O
leaning O
against O
the O
slackened O
royal O
shrouds O
, O
to O
and O
fro O
I O
idly O
swayed O
in O
what O
seemed O
an O
enchanted O
air O
. O
No O
resolution O
could O
withstand O
it O
; O
in O
that O
dreamy O
mood O
losing O
all O
consciousness O
, O
at O
last O
my O
soul O
went O
out O
of O
my O
body O
; O
though O
my O
body O
still O
continued O
to O
sway O
as O
a O
pendulum O
will O
, O
long O
after O
the O
power O
which O
first O
moved O
it O
is O
withdrawn O
. O
Ere O
forgetfulness O
altogether O
came O
over O
me O
, O
I O
had O
noticed O
that O
the O
seamen O
at O
the O
main O
and O
mizzen-mast-heads O
were O
already O
drowsy O
. O
So O
that O
at O
last O
all O
three O
of O
us O
lifelessly O
swung O
from O
the O
spars O
, O
and O
for O
every O
swing O
that O
we O
made O
there O
was O
a O
nod O
from O
below O
from O
the O
slumbering O
helmsman O
. O
The O
waves O
, O
too O
, O
nodded O
their O
indolent O
crests O
; O
and O
across O
the O
wide O
trance O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
east O
nodded O
to O
west O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
over O
all O
. O
Suddenly O
bubbles O
seemed O
bursting O
beneath O
my O
closed O
eyes O
; O
like O
vices O
my O
hands O
grasped O
the O
shrouds O
; O
some O
invisible O
, O
gracious O
agency O
preserved O
me O
; O
with O
a O
shock O
I O
came O
back O
to O
life O
. O
And O
lo O
! O
close O
under O
our O
lee O
, O
not O
forty O
fathoms O
off O
, O
a O
gigantic O
Sperm O
Whale O
lay O
rolling O
in O
the O
water O
like O
the O
capsized O
hull O
of O
a O
frigate O
, O
his O
broad O
, O
glossy O
back O
, O
of O
an O
Ethiopian B-GRP
hue O
, O
glistening O
in O
the O
sun O
’ O
s O
rays O
like O
a O
mirror O
. O
But O
lazily O
undulating O
in O
the O
trough O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
ever O
and O
anon O
tranquilly O
spouting O
his O
vapory O
jet O
, O
the O
whale O
looked O
like O
a O
portly O
burgher O
smoking O
his O
pipe O
of O
a O
warm O
afternoon O
. O
But O
that O
pipe O
, O
poor O
whale O
, O
was O
thy O
last O
. O
As O
if O
struck O
by O
some O
enchanter O
’ O
s O
wand O
, O
the O
sleepy O
ship O
and O
every O
sleeper O
in O
it O
all O
at O
once O
started O
into O
wakefulness O
; O
and O
more O
than O
a O
score O
of O
voices O
from O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
vessel O
, O
simultaneously O
with O
the O
three O
notes O
from O
aloft O
, O
shouted O
forth O
the O
accustomed O
cry O
, O
as O
the O
great O
fish O
slowly O
and O
regularly O
spouted O
the O
sparkling O
brine O
into O
the O
air O
. O
“ O
Clear O
away O
the O
boats O
! O
Luff O
! O
” O
cried O
Ahab B-CHR
. O
And O
obeying O
his O
own O
order O
, O
he O
dashed O
the O
helm O
down O
before O
the O
helmsman O
could O
handle O
the O
spokes O
. O
The O
sudden O
exclamations O
of O
the O
crew O
must O
have O
alarmed O
the O
whale O
; O
and O
ere O
the O
boats O
were O
down O
, O
majestically O
turning O
, O
he O
swam O
away O
to O
the O
leeward O
, O
but O
with O
such O
a O
steady O
tranquillity O
, O
and O
making O
so O
few O
ripples O
as O
he O
swam O
, O
that O
thinking O
after O
all O
he O
might O
not O
as O
yet O
be O
alarmed O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
gave O
orders O
that O
not O
an O
oar O
should O
be O
used O
, O
and O
no O
man O
must O
speak O
but O
in O
whispers O
. O
So O
seated O
like O
Ontario B-GRP
Indians I-GRP
on O
the O
gunwales O
of O
the O
boats O
, O
we O
swiftly O
but O
silently O
paddled O
along O
; O
the O
calm O
not O
admitting O
of O
the O
noiseless O
sails O
being O
set O
. O
Presently O
, O
as O
we O
thus O
glided O
in O
chase O
, O
the O
monster O
perpendicularly O
flitted O
his O
tail O
forty O
feet O
into O
the O
air O
, O
and O
then O
sank O
out O
of O
sight O
like O
a O
tower O
swallowed O
up O
. O
“ O
There O
go O
flukes O
! O
” O
was O
the O
cry O
, O
an O
announcement O
immediately O
followed O
by O
Stubb B-CHR
’ O
s O
producing O
his O
match O
and O
igniting O
his O
pipe O
, O
for O
now O
a O
respite O
was O
granted O
. O
After O
the O
full O
interval O
of O
his O
sounding O
had O
elapsed O
, O
the O
whale O
rose O
again O
, O
and O
being O
now O
in O
advance O
of O
the O
smoker O
’ O
s O
boat O
, O
and O
much O
nearer O
to O
it O
than O
to O
any O
of O
the O
others O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
counted O
upon O
the O
honor O
of O
the O
capture O
. O
It O
was O
obvious O
, O
now O
, O
that O
the O
whale O
had O
at O
length O
become O
aware O
of O
his O
pursuers O
. O
All O
silence O
of O
cautiousness O
was O
therefore O
no O
longer O
of O
use O
. O
Paddles O
were O
dropped O
, O
and O
oars O
came O
loudly O
into O
play O
. O
And O
still O
puffing O
at O
his O
pipe O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
cheered O
on O
his O
crew O
to O
the O
assault O
. O
Yes O
, O
a O
mighty O
change O
had O
come O
over O
the O
fish O
. O
All O
alive O
to O
his O
jeopardy O
, O
he O
was O
going O
“ O
head O
out O
” O
; O
that O
part O
obliquely O
projecting O
from O
the O
mad O
yeast O
which O
he O
brewed O
. O
* O
* O
It O
will O
be O
seen O
in O
some O
other O
place O
of O
what O
a O
very O
light O
substance O
the O
entire O
interior O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
’ O
s O
enormous O
head O
consists O
. O
Though O
apparently O
the O
most O
massive O
, O
it O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
buoyant O
part O
about O
him O
. O
So O
that O
with O
ease O
he O
elevates O
it O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
invariably O
does O
so O
when O
going O
at O
his O
utmost O
speed O
. O
Besides O
, O
such O
is O
the O
breadth O
of O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
front O
of O
his O
head O
, O
and O
such O
the O
tapering O
cut-water O
formation O
of O
the O
lower O
part O
, O
that O
by O
obliquely O
elevating O
his O
head O
, O
he O
thereby O
may O
be O
said O
to O
transform O
himself O
from O
a O
bluff-bowed O
sluggish O
galliot O
into O
a O
sharppointed O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
pilot-boat O
. O
“ O
Start O
her O
, O
start O
her O

my O
men O
! O
Don O
’ O
t O
hurry O
yourselves O
; O
take O
plenty O
of O
time—but O
start O

; O
start O
her O
like O
thunder-claps O
, O
that O
’ O

all O
, O
” O
cried O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
spluttering O
out O
the O
smoke O
as O
he O
spoke O
. O
“ O
Start O
her O
, O
now O
; O

em O
the O
long O

Start O

Tash B-CHR
, O
my O
boy—start O
her O
, O
all O
; O
but O
keep O
cool O
, O
keep O
cool—cucumbers O
is O
the O
word—easy O
, O
easy—only O
start O
her O
like O
grim O
death O
and O
grinning O
devils O
, O
and O
raise O
the O
buried O
dead O
perpendicular O
out O
of O
their O
graves O
, O
boys—that O
’ O

all O
. O
Start O
her O
! O
” O
“ O
Woo-hoo O
! O
Wa-hee O
! O
” O
screamed O
the O
Gay-Header B-GRP
in O
reply O
, O
raising O
some O
old O
war-whoop O
to O
the O
skies O
; O
as O
every O
oarsman O
in O
the O
strained O
boat O
involuntarily O
bounced O
forward O
with O
the O
one O
tremendous O
leading O
stroke O
which O
the O
eager O
Indian B-GRP
gave O
. O
But O
his O
wild O
screams O
were O
answered O
by O
others O
quite O
as O
wild O
. O
“ O
Kee-hee O
! O
Kee-hee O
! O
” O
yelled O
Daggoo B-CHR
, O
straining O
forwards O
and O
backwards O
on O
his O
seat O
, O
like O
a O
pacing O
tiger O
in O
his O
cage O
. O
“ O
Ka-la O
! O
Koo-loo O
! O
” O
howled O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
as O
if O
smacking O
his O
lips O
over O
a O
mouthful O
of O
Grenadier O
’ O
s O
steak O
. O
And O
thus O
with O
oars O
and O
yells O
the O
keels O
cut O
the O
sea O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
retaining O
his O
place O
in O
the O
van O
, O
still O
encouraged O
his O
men O
to O
the O
onset O
, O
all O
the O
while O
puffing O
the O
smoke O
from O
his O
mouth O
. O
Like O
desperadoes O
they O
tugged O
and O
they O
strained O
, O
till O
the O
welcome O
cry O
was O
heard— O
“ O
Stand O
up O
, O
Tashtego B-CHR
! O
—give O
it O
to O
him O
! O
” O
The O
harpoon O
was O
hurled O
. O
“ O
Stern O
all O
! O
” O
The O
oarsmen O
backed O
water O
; O
the O
same O
moment O
something O
went O
hot O
and O
hissing O
along O
every O
one O
of O
their O
wrists O
. O
It O
was O
the O
magical O
line O
. O
An O
instant O
before O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
had O
swiftly O
caught O
two O
additional O
turns O
with O
it O
round O
the O
loggerhead O
, O
whence O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
its O
increased O
rapid O
circlings O
, O
a O
hempen O
blue O
smoke O
now O
jetted O
up O
and O
mingled O
with O
the O
steady O
fumes O
from O
his O
pipe O
. O
As O
the O
line O
passed O
round O
and O
round O
the O
loggerhead O
; O
so O
also O
, O
just O
before O
reaching O
that O
point O
, O
it O
blisteringly O
passed O
through O
and O
through O
both O
of O
Stubb B-CHR
’ O
s O
hands O
, O
from O
which O
the O
hand-cloths O
, O
or O
squares O
of O
quilted O
canvas O
sometimes O
worn O
at O
these O
times O
, O
had O
accidentally O
dropped O
. O
It O
was O
like O
holding O
an O
enemy O
’ O
s O
sharp O
two-edged O
sword O
by O
the O
blade O
, O
and O
that O
enemy O
all O
the O
time O
striving O
to O
wrest O
it O
out O
of O
your O
clutch O
. O
“ O
Wet O
the O
line O
! O
wet O
the O
line O
! O
” O
cried O
Stubb B-CHR
to O
the O
tub O
oarsman O
( O
him O
seated O
by O
the O
tub O
) O
who O
, O
snatching O
off O
his O
hat O
, O
dashed O
sea-water O
into O
it O
. O
* O
More O
turns O
were O
taken O
, O
so O
that O
the O
line O
began O
holding O
its O
place O
. O
The O
boat O
now O
flew O
through O
the O
boiling O
water O
like O
a O
shark O
all O
fins O
. O
Stubb B-CHR
and O
Tashtego B-CHR
here O
changed O
places—stem O
for O
stern—a O
staggering O
business O
truly O
in O
that O
rocking O
commotion O
. O
* O
Partly O
to O
show O
the O
indispensableness O
of O
this O
act O
, O
it O
may O
here O
be O
stated O
, O
that O
, O
in O
the O
old O
Dutch B-GRP
fishery O
, O
a O
mop O
was O
used O
to O
dash O
the O

the O
vibrating O
line O
extending O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
from O
its O
now O
being O
more O
tight O
than O
a O
harpstring O
, O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
the O
craft O
had O
two O
keels—one O
cleaving O
the O
water O
, O
the O
other O
the O
air—as O
the O
boat O
churned O
on O
through O
both O
opposing O
elements O
at O
once O
. O
A O
continual O
cascade O
played O
at O
the O
bows O
; O
a O
ceaseless O
whirling O
eddy O
in O
her O
wake O
; O
and O
, O
at O
the O
slightest O
motion O
from O
within O
, O
even O
but O
of O
a O
little O
finger O
, O
the O
vibrating O
, O
cracking O
craft O
canted O
over O
her O
spasmodic O
gunwale O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
Thus O
they O
rushed O
; O
each O
man O
with O
might O
and O
main O
clinging O
to O
his O
seat O
, O
to O
prevent O
being O
tossed O
to O
the O
foam O
; O
and O
the O
tall O
form O
of O
Tashtego B-CHR
at O
the O
steering O
oar O
crouching O
almost O
double O
, O
in O
order O
to O
bring O
down O
his O
centre O
of O
gravity O
. O
Whole O
Atlantics B-LOC
and O
Pacifics B-LOC
seemed O
passed O
as O
they O
shot O
on O
their O
way O
, O
till O
at O
length O
the O
whale O
somewhat O
slackened O
his O
flight O
. O
“ O
Haul O
in—haul O
in O
! O
” O
cried O
Stubb B-CHR
to O
the O
bowsman O
! O
and O
, O
facing O
round O
towards O
the O
whale O
, O
all O
hands O
began O
pulling O
the O
boat O
up O
to O
him O
, O
while O
yet O
the O
boat O
was O
being O
towed O
on O
. O
Soon O
ranging O
up O
by O
his O
flank O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
firmly O
planting O
his O
knee O
in O
the O
clumsy O
cleat O
, O
darted O
dart O
after O
dart O
into O
the O
flying O
fish O
; O
at O
the O
word O
of O
command O
, O
the O
boat O
alternately O
sterning O
out O
of O
the O
way O
of O
the O
whale O
’ O
s O
horrible O
wallow O
, O
and O
then O
ranging O
up O
for O
another O
fling O
. O
The O
red O
tide O
now O
poured O
from O
all O
sides O
of O
the O
monster O
like O
brooks O
down O
a O
hill O
. O
His O
tormented O
body O
rolled O
not O
in O
brine O
but O
in O
blood O
, O
which O
bubbled O
and O
seethed O
for O
furlongs O
behind O
in O
their O
wake O
. O
The O
slanting O
sun O
playing O
upon O
this O
crimson O
pond O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
sent O
back O
its O
reflection O
into O
every O
face O
, O
so O
that O
they O
all O
glowed O
to O
each O
other O
like O
red O
men O
. O
And O
all O
the O
while O
, O
jet O
after O
jet O
of O
white O
smoke O
was O
agonizingly O
shot O
from O
the O
spiracle O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
and O
vehement O
puff O
after O
puff O
from O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
excited O
headsman O
; O
as O
at O
every O
dart O
, O
hauling O
in O
upon O
his O
crooked O
lance O
( O
by O
the O
line O
attached O
to O
it O
) O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
straightened O
it O
again O
and O
again O
, O
by O
a O
few O
rapid O
blows O
against O
the O
gunwale O
, O
then O
again O
and O
again O
sent O
it O
into O
the O
whale O
. O
“ O
Pull O
up—pull O
up O
! O
” O
he O
now O
cried O
to O
the O
bowsman O
, O
as O
the O
waning O
whale O
relaxed O
in O
his O
wrath O
. O
“ O
Pull O
up O
! O
—close O
to O
! O
” O
and O
the O
boat O
ranged O
along O
the O
fish O
’ O
s O
flank O
. O
When O
reaching O
far O
over O
the O
bow O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
slowly O
churned O
his O
long O
sharp O
lance O
into O
the O
fish O
, O
and O
kept O
it O
there O
, O
carefully O
churning O
and O
churning O
, O
as O
if O
cautiously O
seeking O
to O
feel O
after O
some O
gold O
watch O
that O
the O
whale O
might O
have O
swallowed O
, O
and O
which O
he O
was O
fearful O
of O
breaking O
ere O
he O
could O
hook O
it O
out O
. O
But O
that O
gold O
watch O
he O
sought O
was O
the O
innermost O
life O
of O
the O
fish O
. O
And O
now O
it O
is O
struck O
; O
for O
, O
starting O
from O
his O
trance O
into O
that O
unspeakable O
thing O
called O
his O
“ O
flurry O
, O
” O
the O
monster O
horribly O
wallowed O
in O
his O
blood O
, O
overwrapped O
himself O
in O
impenetrable O
, O
mad O
, O
boiling O
spray O
, O
so O
that O
the O
imperilled O
craft O
, O
instantly O
dropping O
astern O
, O
had O
much O
ado O
blindly O
to O
struggle O
out O
from O
that O
phrensied O
twilight O
into O
the O
clear O
air O
of O
the O
day O
. O
And O
now O
abating O
in O
his O
flurry O
, O
the O
whale O
once O
more O
rolled O
out O
into O
view O
; O
surging O
from O
side O
to O
side O
; O
spasmodically O
dilating O
and O
contracting O
his O
spout-hole O
, O
with O
sharp O
, O
cracking O
, O
agonized O
respirations O
. O
At O
last O
, O
gush O
after O
gush O
of O
clotted O
red O
gore O
, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
the O
purple O
lees O
of O
red O
wine O
, O
shot O
into O
the O
frighted O
air O
; O
and O
falling O
back O
again O
, O
ran O
dripping O
down O
his O
motionless O
flanks O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
His O
heart O
had O
burst O
! O
“ O
He O
’ O
s O
dead O
, O
Mr. B-CHR
Stubb I-CHR
, O
” O
said O
Daggoo B-CHR
. O
“ O
Yes O
; O
both O
pipes O
smoked O
out O
! O
” O
and O
withdrawing O
his O
own O
from O
his O
mouth O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
scattered O
the O
dead O
ashes O
over O
the O
water O
; O
and O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
stood O
thoughtfully O
eyeing O
the O
vast O
corpse O
he O
had O
made O
. O
