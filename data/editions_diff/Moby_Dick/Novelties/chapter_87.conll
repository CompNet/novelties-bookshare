The O
long O
and O
narrow O
peninsula O
of O
Malacca B-LOC
, O
extending O
south-eastward O
from O
the O
territories O
of O
Birmah B-LOC
, O
forms O
the O
most O
southerly O
point O
of O
all O
Asia B-LOC
. O
In O
a O
continuous O
line O
from O
that O
peninsula O
stretch O
the O
long O
islands O
of O
Sumatra B-LOC
, O
Java B-LOC
, O
Bally B-LOC
, O
and O
Timor B-LOC
; O
which O
, O
with O
many O
others O
, O
form O
a O
vast O
mole O
, O
or O
rampart O
, O
lengthwise O
connecting O
Asia B-LOC
with O
Australia B-LOC
, O
and O
dividing O
the O
long O
unbroken O
Indian B-LOC
ocean I-LOC
from O
the O
thickly O
studded O
oriental O
archipelagoes O
. O
This O
rampart O
is O
pierced O
by O
several O
sally-ports O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
ships O
and O
whales O
; O
conspicuous O
among O
which O
are O
the O
straits O
of O
Sunda B-LOC
and O
Malacca B-LOC
. O
By O
the O
straits O
of O
Sunda B-LOC
, O
chiefly O
, O
vessels O
bound O
to O
China B-LOC
from O
the O
west O
, O
emerge O
into O
the O
China B-LOC
seas O
. O
Those O
narrow O
straits O
of O
Sunda B-LOC
divide O
Sumatra B-LOC
from O
Java B-LOC
; O
and O
standing O
midway O
in O
that O
vast O
rampart O
of O
islands O
, O
buttressed O
by O
that O
bold O
green O
promontory O
, O
known O
to O
seamen O
as O
Java B-LOC
Head I-LOC
; O
they O
not O
a O
little O
correspond O
to O
the O
central O
gateway O
opening O
into O
some O
vast O
walled O
empire O
: O
and O
considering O
the O
inexhaustible O
wealth O
of O
spices O
, O
and O
silks O
, O
and O
jewels O
, O
and O
gold O
, O
and O
ivory O
, O
with O
which O
the O
thousand O
islands O
of O
that O
oriental O
sea O
are O
enriched O
, O
it O
seems O
a O
significant O
provision O
of O
nature O
, O
that O
such O
treasures O
, O
by O
the O
very O
formation O
of O
the O
land O
, O
should O
at O
least O
bear O
the O
appearance O
, O
however O
ineffectual O
, O
of O
being O
guarded O
from O
the O
all-grasping O
western O
world O
. O
The O
shores O
of O
the O
Straits B-LOC
of I-LOC
Sunda I-LOC
are O
unsupplied O
with O
those O
domineering O
fortresses O
which O
guard O
the O
entrances O
to O
the O
Mediterranean B-LOC
, O
the O
Baltic B-LOC
, O
and O
the O
Propontis B-LOC
. O
Unlike O
the O
Danes B-GRP
, O
these O
Orientals B-GRP
do O
not O
demand O
the O
obsequious O
homage O
of O
lowered O
top-sails O
from O
the O
endless O
procession O
of O
ships O
before O
the O
wind O
, O
which O
for O
centuries O
past O
, O
by O
night O
and O
by O
day O
, O
have O
passed O
between O
the O
islands O
of O
Sumatra B-LOC
and O
Java B-LOC
, O
freighted O
with O
the O
costliest O
cargoes O
of O
the O
east O
. O
But O
while O
they O
freely O
waive O
a O
ceremonial O
like O
this O
, O
they O
do O
by O
no O
means O
renounce O
their O
claim O
to O
more O
solid O
tribute O
. O
Time O
out O
of O
mind O
the O
piratical O
proas O
of O
the O
Malays B-GRP
, O
lurking O
among O
the O
low O
shaded O
coves O
and O
islets O
of O
Sumatra B-LOC
, O
have O
sallied O
out O
upon O
the O
vessels O
sailing O
through O
the O
straits O
, O
fiercely O
demanding O
tribute O
at O
the O
point O
of O
their O
spears O
. O
Though O
by O
the O
repeated O
bloody O
chastisements O
they O
have O
received O
at O
the O
hands O
of O
European B-GRP
cruisers O
, O
the O
audacity O
of O
these O
corsairs O
has O
of O
late O
been O
somewhat O
repressed O
; O
yet O
, O
even O
at O
the O
present O
day O
, O
we O
occasionally O
hear O
of O
English B-GRP
and O
American B-GRP
vessels O
, O
which O
, O
in O
those O
waters O
, O
have O
been O
remorselessly O
boarded O
and O
pillaged O
. O
With O
a O
fair O
, O
fresh O
wind O
, O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
now O
drawing O
nigh O
to O
these O
straits O
; O
Ahab B-CHR
purposing O
to O
pass O
through O
them O
into O
the O
Javan B-LOC
sea I-LOC
, O
and O
thence O
, O
cruising O
northwards O
, O
over O
waters O
known O
to O
be O
frequented O
here O
and O
there O
by O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
sweep O
inshore O
by O
the O
Philippine B-LOC
Islands I-LOC
, O
and O
gain O
the O
far O
coast O
of O
Japan B-LOC
, O
in O
time O
for O
the O
great O
whaling O
season O
there O
. O
By O
these O
means O
, O
the O
circumnavigating O
Pequod B-MSC
would O
sweep O
almost O
all O
the O
known O
Sperm O
Whale O
cruising O
grounds O
of O
the O
world O
, O
previous O
to O
descending O
upon O
the O
Line B-LOC
in O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
; O
where O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
though O
everywhere O
else O
foiled O
in O
his O
pursuit O
, O
firmly O
counted O
upon O
giving O
battle O
to O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
, O
in O
the O
sea O
he O
was O
most O
known O
to O
frequent O
; O
and O
at O
a O
season O
when O
he O
might O
most O
reasonably O
be O
presumed O
to O
be O
haunting O
it O
. O
But O
how O
now O
? O
in O
this O
zoned O
quest O
, O
does O
Ahab B-CHR
touch O
no O
land O
? O
does O
his O
crew O
drink O
air O
? O
Surely O
, O
he O
will O
stop O
for O
water O
. O
Nay O
. O
For O
a O
long O
time O
, O
now O
, O
the O
circus-running O
sun O
has O
raced O
within O
his O
fiery O
ring O
, O
and O
needs O
no O
sustenance O
but O
what O
’ O
s O
in O
himself O
. O
So O
Ahab B-CHR
. O
Mark O
this O
, O
too O
, O
in O
the O
whaler O
. O
While O
other O
hulls O
are O
loaded O
down O
with O
alien O
stuff O
, O
to O
be O
transferred O
to O
foreign O
wharves O
; O
the O
world-wandering O
whale-ship O
carries O
no O
cargo O
but O
herself O
and O
crew O
, O
their O
weapons O
and O
their O
wants O
. O
She O
has O
a O
whole O
lake O
’ O
s O
contents O
bottled O
in O
her O
ample O
hold O
. O
She O
is O
ballasted O
with O
utilities O
; O
not O
altogether O
with O
unusable O
pig-lead O
and O
kentledge O
. O
She O
carries O
years O
’ O
water O
in O
her O
. O
Clear O
old O
prime O
Nantucket B-LOC
water O
; O
which O
, O
when O
three O
years O
afloat O
, O
the O
Nantucketer B-GRP
, O
in O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
, O
prefers O
to O
drink O
before O
the O
brackish O
fluid O
, O
but O
yesterday O
rafted O
off O
in O
casks O
, O
from O
the O
Peruvian B-GRP
or O
Indian B-GRP
streams O
. O
Hence O
it O
is O
, O
that O
, O
while O
other O
ships O
may O
have O
gone O
to O
China B-LOC
from O
New B-LOC
York I-LOC
, O
and O
back O
again O
, O
touching O
at O
a O
score O
of O
ports O
, O
the O
whale-ship O
, O
in O
all O
that O
interval O
, O
may O
not O
have O
sighted O
one O
grain O
of O
soil O
; O
her O
crew O
having O
seen O
no O
man O
but O
floating O
seamen O
like O
themselves O
. O
So O
that O
did O
you O
carry O
them O
the O
news O
that O
another O
flood O
had O
come O
; O
they O
would O
only O
answer— O
“ O
Well O
, O
boys O
, O
here O
’ O
s O
the O
ark O
! O
” O
Now O
, O
as O
many O
Sperm O
Whales O
had O
been O
captured O
off O
the O
western O
coast O
of O
Java B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
near O
vicinity O
of O
the O
Straits B-LOC
of I-LOC
Sunda I-LOC
; O
indeed O
, O
as O
most O
of O
the O
ground O
, O
roundabout O
, O
was O
generally O
recognised O
by O
the O
fishermen O
as O
an O
excellent O
spot O
for O
cruising O
; O
therefore O
, O
as O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
gained O
more O
and O
more O
upon O
Java B-LOC
Head I-LOC
, O
the O
look-outs O
were O
repeatedly O
hailed O
, O
and O
admonished O
to O
keep O
wide O
awake O
. O
But O
though O
the O
green O
palmy O
cliffs O
of O
the O
land O
soon O
loomed O
on O
the O
starboard O
bow O
, O
and O
with O
delighted O
nostrils O
the O
fresh O
cinnamon O
was O
snuffed O
in O
the O
air O
, O
yet O
not O
a O
single O
jet O
was O
descried O
. O
Almost O
renouncing O
all O
thought O
of O
falling O
in O
with O
any O
game O
hereabouts O
, O
the O
ship O
had O
well O
nigh O
entered O
the O
straits O
, O
when O
the O
customary O
cheering O
cry O
was O
heard O
from O
aloft O
, O
and O
ere O
long O
a O
spectacle O
of O
singular O
magnificence O
saluted O
us O
. O
But O
here O
be O
it O
premised O
, O
that O
owing O
to O
the O
unwearied O
activity O
with O
which O
of O
late O
they O
have O
been O
hunted O
over O
all O
four O
oceans O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whales O
, O
instead O
of O
almost O
invariably O
sailing O
in O
small O
detached O
companies O
, O
as O
in O
former O
times O
, O
are O
now O
frequently O
met O
with O
in O
extensive O
herds O
, O
sometimes O
embracing O
so O
great O
a O
multitude O
, O
that O
it O
would O
almost O
seem O
as O
if O
numerous O
nations O
of O
them O
had O
sworn O
solemn O
league O
and O
covenant O
for O
mutual O
assistance O
and O
protection O
. O
To O
this O
aggregation O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
into O
such O
immense O
caravans O
, O
may O
be O
imputed O
the O
circumstance O
that O
even O
in O
the O
best O
cruising O
grounds O
, O
you O
may O
now O
sometimes O
sail O
for O
weeks O
and O
months O
together O
, O
without O
being O
greeted O
by O
a O
single O
spout O
; O
and O
then O
be O
suddenly O
saluted O
by O
what O
sometimes O
seems O
thousands O
on O
thousands O
. O
Broad O
on O
both O
bows O
, O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
some O
two O
or O
three O
miles O
, O
and O
forming O
a O
great O
semicircle O
, O
embracing O
one O
half O
of O
the O
level O
horizon O
, O
a O
continuous O
chain O
of O
whale-jets O
were O
up-playing O
and O
sparkling O
in O
the O
noon-day O
air O
. O
Unlike O
the O
straight O
perpendicular O
twin-jets O
of O
the O
Right O
Whale O
, O
which O
, O
dividing O
at O
top O
, O
fall O
over O
in O
two O
branches O
, O
like O
the O
cleft O
drooping O
boughs O
of O
a O
willow O
, O
the O
single O
forward-slanting O
spout O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
presents O
a O
thick O
curled O
bush O
of O
white O
mist O
, O
continually O
rising O
and O
falling O
away O
to O

Seen O
from O
the O
Pequod B-MSC

then O
, O
as O
she O
would O
rise O
on O
a O
high O
hill O
of O
the O

, O
this O
host O
of O
vapory O

up O

through O
a O

atmosphere O
of O
bluish O

showed O

the O
thousand O
cheerful O

of O
some O
dense O

descried O
of O
a O
balmy O
autumnal O
morning O

by O
some O

As O

Ahab B-CHR

fairly O
have O
entered O
the O

these O
rascally O

were O
now O
in O
hot O

to O
make O
up O
for O
their O
over-cautious O

But O
when O
the O

Pequod B-MSC
, O
with O
a O
fresh O
leading O

, O
was O
herself O

As O
with O

Ahab B-CHR
to-and-fro O
paced O
the O
deck O
; O
in O
his O
forward O
turn O
beholding O
the O
monsters O

chased O

chasing O
_him_ O
; O
some O
such O
fancy O
as O
the O
above O
seemed O
his O
. O
And O
when O
he O
glanced O
upon O
the O
green O
walls O
of O
the O
watery O
defile O
in O
which O
the O
ship O
was O
then O
sailing O
, O
and O
bethought O
him O
that O
through O
that O
gate O
lay O
the O
route O
to O
his O
vengeance O
, O
and O
beheld O
, O
how O
that O
through O
that O
same O
gate O
he O
was O
now O
both O
chasing O
and O
being O
chased O
to O
his O
deadly O
end O
; O
and O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
a O
herd O
of O
remorseless O
wild O
pirates O
and O
inhuman O
atheistical O
devils O
were O
infernally O
cheering O
him O
on O
with O
their O
curses O
; O
—when O
all O
these O
conceits O
had O
passed O
through O
his O
brain O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
brow O
was O
left O
gaunt O
and O
ribbed O
, O
like O
the O
black O
sand O
beach O
after O
some O
stormy O
tide O
has O
been O
gnawing O
it O
, O
without O
being O
able O
to O
drag O
the O
firm O
thing O
from O
its O
place O
. O
But O
thoughts O
like O
these O
troubled O
very O
few O
of O
the O
reckless O
crew O
; O
and O
when O
, O
after O

astern O
, O

side O
, O
emerging O
at O
last O
upon O
the O
broad O
waters O
beyond O

then O
, O
the O
harpooneers O
seemed O
more O
to O
grieve O
that O
the O
swift O
whales O
had O
been O
gaining O
upon O
the O
ship O
, O
than O
to O
rejoice O
that O
the O
ship O
had O
so O
victoriously O
gained O
upon O
the O
Malays B-GRP
. O
But O
still O
driving O
on O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
whales O
, O
at O
length O
they O
seemed O
abating O
their O
speed O
; O
gradually O
the O
ship O
neared O
them O
; O
and O
the O
wind O
now O
dying O
away O
, O
word O
was O
passed O
to O
spring O
to O
the O
boats O
. O
But O
no O
sooner O
did O
the O
herd O
, O
by O
some O
presumed O
wonderful O
instinct O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
become O
notified O
of O
the O
three O
keels O
that O
were O
after O
them O
, O
—though O
as O
yet O
a O
mile O
in O
their O
rear O
, O
—than O
they O
rallied O
again O
, O
and O
forming O
in O
close O
ranks O
and O
battalions O
, O
so O
that O
their O
spouts O
all O
looked O
like O
flashing O
lines O
of O
stacked O
bayonets O
, O
moved O
on O
with O
redoubled O
velocity O
. O
Stripped O
to O
our O
shirts O
and O
drawers O
, O
we O
sprang O
to O
the O
white-ash O
, O
and O
after O
several O
hours O
’ O
pulling O
were O
almost O
disposed O
to O
renounce O
the O
chase O
, O
when O
a O
general O
pausing O
commotion O
among O
the O
whales O
gave O
animating O
token O
that O
they O
were O
now O
at O
last O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
that O
strange O
perplexity O
of O
inert O
irresolution O
, O
which O
, O
when O
the O
fishermen O
perceive O
it O
in O
the O
whale O
, O
they O
say O
he O
is O
gallied O
. O
The O
compact O
martial O
columns O
in O
which O
they O
had O
been O
hitherto O
rapidly O
and O
steadily O
swimming O
, O
were O
now O
broken O
up O
in O
one O
measureless O
rout O
; O
and O
like O
King B-CHR
Porus I-CHR
’ O
elephants O
in O
the O
Indian B-GRP
battle O
with O
Alexander B-CHR
, O
they O
seemed O
going O
mad O
with O
consternation O
. O
In O
all O
directions O
expanding O
in O
vast O
irregular O
circles O
, O
and O
aimlessly O
swimming O
hither O
and O
thither O
, O
by O
their O
short O
thick O
spoutings O
, O
they O
plainly O
betrayed O
their O
distraction O
of O
panic O
. O
This O
was O
still O
more O
strangely O
evinced O
by O
those O
of O
their O
number O
, O
who O
, O
completely O
paralysed O
as O
it O
were O
, O
helplessly O
floated O
like O
water-logged O
dismantled O
ships O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
Had O
these O
Leviathans O
been O
but O
a O
flock O
of O
simple O
sheep O
, O
pursued O
over O
the O
pasture O
by O
three O
fierce O
wolves O
, O
they O
could O
not O
possibly O
have O
evinced O
such O
excessive O
dismay O
. O
But O
this O
occasional O
timidity O
is O
characteristic O
of O
almost O
all O
herding O
creatures O
. O
Though O
banding O
together O
in O
tens O
of O
thousands O
, O
the O
lion-maned O
buffaloes O
of O
the O
West O
have O
fled O
before O
a O
solitary O
horseman O
. O
Witness O
, O
too O
, O
all O
human O
beings O
, O
how O
when O
herded O
together O
in O
the O
sheepfold O
of O
a O
theatre O
’ O

pit O
, O
they O
will O
, O
at O
the O
slightest O
alarm O
of O
fire O
, O
rush O
helter-skelter O
for O
the O
outlets O
, O
crowding O
, O
trampling O
, O
jamming O
, O
and O
remorselessly O
dashing O
each O
other O
to O
death O
. O
Best O
, O
therefore O
, O
withhold O
any O
amazement O
at O
the O
strangely O
gallied O
whales O
before O
us O
, O
for O
there O
is O
no O
folly O
of O
the O
beasts O
of O
the O
earth O
which O
is O
not O
infinitely O
outdone O
by O
the O
madness O
of O
men O
. O
Though O
many O
of O
the O
whales O
, O
as O
has O
been O
said O
, O
were O
in O
violent O
motion O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
to O
be O
observed O
that O
as O
a O
whole O
the O
herd O
neither O
advanced O
nor O
retreated O
, O
but O
collectively O
remained O
in O
one O
place O
. O
As O
is O
customary O
in O
those O
cases O
, O
the O
boats O
at O
once O
separated O
, O
each O
making O
for O
some O
one O
lone O
whale O
on O
the O
outskirts O
of O
the O
shoal O
. O
In O
about O
three O
minutes O
’ O
time O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O
s O
harpoon O
was O
flung O
; O
the O
stricken O
fish O
darted O
blinding O
spray O
in O
our O
faces O
, O
and O
then O
running O
away O
with O
us O
like O
light O
, O
steered O
straight O
for O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
herd O
. O
Though O
such O
a O
movement O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
whale O
struck O
under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
is O
in O
no O
wise O
unprecedented O
; O
and O
indeed O
is O
almost O
always O
more O
or O
less O
anticipated O
; O
yet O
does O
it O
present O
one O
of O
the O
more O
perilous O
vicissitudes O
of O
the O
fishery O
. O
For O
as O
the O
swift O
monster O
drags O
you O
deeper O
and O
deeper O
into O
the O
frantic O
shoal O
, O
you O
bid O
adieu O
to O
circumspect O
life O
and O
only O
exist O
in O
a O
delirious O
throb O
. O
As O
, O
blind O
and O
deaf O
, O
the O
whale O
plunged O
forward O
, O
as O
if O
by O
sheer O
power O
of O
speed O
to O
rid O
himself O
of O
the O
iron O
leech O
that O
had O
fastened O
to O
him O
; O
as O
we O
thus O
tore O
a O
white O
gash O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
on O
all O
sides O
menaced O
as O
we O
flew O
, O
by O
the O
crazed O
creatures O
to O
and O
fro O
rushing O
about O
us O
; O
our O
beset O
boat O
was O
like O
a O
ship O
mobbed O
by O
ice-isles O
in O
a O
tempest O
, O
and O
striving O
to O
steer O
through O
their O
complicated O
channels O
and O
straits O
, O
knowing O
not O
at O
what O
moment O
it O
may O
be O
locked O
in O
and O
crushed O
. O
But O
not O
a O
bit O
daunted O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
steered O
us O
manfully O
; O
now O
sheering O
off O
from O
this O
monster O
directly O
across O
our O
route O
in O
advance O
; O
now O
edging O
away O
from O
that O
, O
whose O
colossal O
flukes O
were O
suspended O
overhead O
, O
while O
all O
the O
time O
, O
Starbuck B-CHR
stood O
up O
in O
the O
bows O
, O
lance O
in O
hand O
, O
pricking O
out O
of O
our O
way O
whatever O
whales O
he O
could O
reach O
by O
short O
darts O
, O
for O
there O
was O
no O
time O
to O
make O
long O
ones O
. O
Nor O
were O
the O
oarsmen O
quite O
idle O
, O
though O
their O
wonted O
duty O
was O
now O
altogether O
dispensed O
with O
. O
They O
chiefly O
attended O
to O
the O
shouting O
part O
of O
the O
business O
. O
“ O
Out O
of O
the O
way O
, O
Commodore O
! O
” O
cried O
one O
, O
to O
a O
great O
dromedary O
that O
of O
a O
sudden O
rose O
bodily O
to O
the O
surface O
, O
and O
for O
an O
instant O
threatened O
to O
swamp O
us O
. O
“ O
Hard O
down O
with O
your O
tail O
, O
there O
! O
” O
cried O
a O
second O
to O
another O
, O
which O
, O
close O
to O
our O
gunwale O
, O
seemed O
calmly O
cooling O
himself O
with O
his O
own O
fan-like O
extremity O
. O
All O
whaleboats O
carry O
certain O
curious O
contrivances O
, O
originally O
invented O
by O
the O
Nantucket B-LOC
Indians B-GRP
, O
called O
druggs O
. O
Two O
thick O
squares O
of O
wood O
of O
equal O
size O
are O
stoutly O
clenched O
together O
, O
so O
that O
they O
cross O
each O
other O
’ O
s O
grain O
at O
right O
angles O
; O
a O
line O
of O
considerable O
length O
is O
then O
attached O
to O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
block O
, O
and O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
line O
being O
looped O
, O
it O
can O
in O
a O
moment O
be O
fastened O
to O
a O
harpoon O
. O
It O
is O
chiefly O
among O
gallied O
whales O
that O
this O
drugg O
is O
used O
. O
For O
then O
, O
more O
whales O
are O
close O
round O
you O
than O
you O
can O
possibly O
chase O
at O
one O
time O
. O
But O
sperm O
whales O
are O
not O
every O
day O
encountered O
; O
while O
you O
may O
, O
then O
, O
you O
must O
kill O
all O
you O
can O
. O
And O
if O
you O
can O
not O
kill O
them O
all O
at O
once O
, O
you O
must O
wing O
them O
, O
so O
that O
they O
can O
be O
afterwards O
killed O
at O
your O
leisure O
. O
Hence O
it O
is O
, O
that O
at O
times O
like O
these O
the O
drugg O
, O
comes O
into O
requisition O
. O
Our O
boat O
was O
furnished O
with O
three O
of O
them O
. O
The O
first O
and O
second O
were O
successfully O
darted O
, O
and O
we O
saw O
the O
whales O
staggeringly O
running O
off O
, O
fettered O
by O
the O
enormous O
sidelong O
resistance O
of O
the O
towing O
drugg O
. O
They O
were O
cramped O
like O
malefactors O
with O
the O
chain O
and O
ball O
. O
But O
upon O
flinging O
the O
third O
, O
in O
the O
act O
of O
tossing O
overboard O
the O
clumsy O
wooden O
block O
, O
it O
caught O
under O
one O
of O
the O
seats O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
in O
an O
instant O
tore O
it O
out O
and O
carried O
it O
away O
, O
dropping O
the O
oarsman O
in O
the O
boat O
’ O
s O
bottom O
as O
the O
seat O
slid O
from O
under O
him O
. O
On O
both O
sides O
the O
sea O
came O
in O
at O
the O
wounded O
planks O
, O
but O
we O
stuffed O
two O
or O
three O
drawers O
and O
shirts O
in O
, O
and O
so O
stopped O
the O
leaks O
for O
the O
time O
. O
It O
had O
been O
next O
to O
impossible O
to O
dart O
these O
drugged-harpoons O
, O
were O
it O
not O
that O
as O
we O
advanced O
into O
the O
herd O
, O
our O
whale O
’ O
s O
way O
greatly O
diminished O
; O
moreover O
, O
that O
as O
we O
went O
still O
further O
and O
further O
from O
the O
circumference O
of O
commotion O
, O
the O
direful O
disorders O
seemed O
waning O
. O
So O
that O
when O
at O
last O
the O
jerking O
harpoon O
drew O
out O
, O
and O
the O
towing O
whale O
sideways O
vanished O
; O
then O
, O
with O
the O
tapering O
force O
of O
his O
parting O
momentum O
, O
we O
glided O
between O
two O
whales O
into O
the O
innermost O
heart O
of O
the O
shoal O
, O
as O
if O
from O
some O
mountain O
torrent O
we O
had O
slid O
into O
a O
serene O
valley O
lake O
. O
Here O
the O
storms O
in O
the O
roaring O
glens O
between O
the O
outermost O
whales O
, O
were O
heard O
but O
not O
felt O
. O
In O
this O
central O
expanse O
the O
sea O
presented O
that O
smooth O
satin-like O
surface O
, O
called O
a O
sleek O
, O
produced O
by O
the O
subtle O
moisture O
thrown O
off O
by O
the O
whale O
in O
his O
more O
quiet O
moods O
. O
Yes O
, O
we O
were O
now O
in O
that O
enchanted O
calm O
which O
they O
say O
lurks O
at O
the O
heart O
of O
every O
commotion O
. O
And O
still O
in O
the O
distracted O
distance O
we O
beheld O
the O
tumults O
of O
the O
outer O
concentric O
circles O
, O
and O
saw O
successive O
pods O
of O
whales O
, O
eight O
or O
ten O
in O
each O
, O
swiftly O
going O
round O
and O
round O
, O
like O
multiplied O
spans O
of O
horses O
in O
a O
ring O
; O
and O
so O
closely O
shoulder O
to O
shoulder O
, O
that O
a O
Titanic B-MSC
circus-rider O
might O
easily O
have O
over-arched O
the O
middle O
ones O
, O
and O
so O
have O
gone O
round O
on O
their O
backs O
. O
Owing O
to O
the O
density O
of O
the O
crowd O
of O
reposing O
whales O
, O
more O
immediately O
surrounding O
the O
embayed O
axis O
of O
the O
herd O
, O
no O
possible O
chance O
of O
escape O
was O
at O
present O
afforded O
us O
. O
We O
must O
watch O
for O
a O
breach O
in O
the O
living O
wall O
that O
hemmed O
us O
in O
; O
the O
wall O
that O
had O
only O
admitted O
us O
in O
order O
to O
shut O
us O
up O
. O
Keeping O
at O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
lake O
, O
we O
were O
occasionally O
visited O
by O
small O
tame O
cows O
and O
calves O
; O
the O
women O
and O
children O
of O
this O
routed O
host O
. O
Now O
, O
inclusive O
of O
the O
occasional O
wide O
intervals O
between O
the O
revolving O
outer O
circles O
, O
and O
inclusive O
of O
the O
spaces O
between O
the O
various O
pods O
in O
any O
one O
of O
those O
circles O
, O
the O
entire O
area O
at O
this O
juncture O
, O
embraced O
by O
the O
whole O
multitude O
, O
must O
have O
contained O
at O
least O
two O
or O
three O
square O
miles O
. O
At O
any O
rate—though O
indeed O
such O
a O
test O
at O
such O
a O
time O
might O
be O
deceptive—spoutings O
might O
be O
discovered O
from O
our O
low O
boat O
that O
seemed O
playing O
up O
almost O
from O
the O
rim O
of O
the O
horizon O
. O
I O
mention O
this O
circumstance O
, O
because O
, O
as O
if O
the O
cows O
and O
calves O
had O
been O
purposely O
locked O
up O
in O
this O
innermost O
fold O
; O
and O
as O
if O
the O
wide O
extent O
of O
the O
herd O
had O
hitherto O
prevented O
them O
from O
learning O
the O
precise O
cause O
of O
its O
stopping O
; O
or O
, O
possibly O
, O
being O
so O
young O
, O
unsophisticated O
, O
and O
every O
way O
innocent O
and O
inexperienced O
; O
however O
it O
may O
have O
been O
, O
these O
smaller O
whales—now O
and O
then O
visiting O
our O
becalmed O
boat O
from O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
lake—evinced O
a O
wondrous O
fearlessness O
and O
confidence O
, O
or O
else O
a O
still O
becharmed O
panic O
which O
it O
was O
impossible O
not O
to O
marvel O
at O
. O
Like O
household O
dogs O
they O
came O
snuffling O
round O
us O
, O
right O
up O
to O
our O
gunwales O
, O
and O
touching O
them O
; O
till O
it O
almost O
seemed O
that O
some O
spell O
had O
suddenly O
domesticated O
them O
. O
Queequeg B-CHR
patted O
their O
foreheads O
; O
Starbuck B-CHR
scratched O
their O
backs O
with O
his O
lance O
; O
but O
fearful O
of O
the O
consequences O
, O
for O
the O
time O
refrained O
from O
darting O
it O
. O
But O
far O
beneath O
this O
wondrous O
world O
upon O
the O
surface O
, O
another O
and O
still O
stranger O
world O
met O
our O
eyes O
as O
we O
gazed O
over O
the O
side O
. O
For O
, O
suspended O
in O
those O
watery O
vaults O
, O
floated O
the O
forms O
of O
the O
nursing O
mothers O
of O
the O
whales O
, O
and O
those O
that O
by O
their O
enormous O
girth O
seemed O
shortly O
to O
become O
mothers O
. O
The O
lake O
, O
as O
I O
have O
hinted O
, O
was O
to O
a O
considerable O
depth O
exceedingly O
transparent O
; O
and O
as O
human O
infants O
while O
suckling O
will O
calmly O
and O
fixedly O
gaze O
away O
from O
the O
breast O
, O
as O
if O
leading O
two O
different O
lives O
at O
the O
time O
; O
and O
while O
yet O
drawing O
mortal O
nourishment O
, O
be O
still O
spiritually O
feasting O
upon O
some O
unearthly O
reminiscence O
; O
—even O
so O
did O
the O
young O
of O
these O
whales O
seem O
looking O
up O
towards O
us O
, O
but O
not O
at O
us O
, O
as O
if O
we O
were O
but O
a O
bit O
of O
Gulfweed O
in O
their O
new-born O
sight O
. O
Floating O
on O
their O
sides O
, O
the O
mothers O
also O
seemed O
quietly O
eyeing O
us O
. O
One O
of O
these O
little O
infants O
, O
that O
from O
certain O
queer O
tokens O
seemed O
hardly O
a O
day O
old O
, O
might O
have O
measured O
some O
fourteen O
feet O
in O
length O
, O
and O
some O
six O
feet O
in O
girth O
. O
He O
was O
a O
little O
frisky O
; O
though O
as O
yet O
his O
body O
seemed O
scarce O
yet O
recovered O
from O
that O
irksome O
position O
it O
had O
so O
lately O
occupied O
in O
the O
maternal O
reticule O
; O
where O
, O
tail O
to O
head O
, O
and O
all O
ready O
for O
the O
final O
spring O
, O
the O
unborn O
whale O
lies O
bent O
like O
a O
Tartar B-GRP
’ O
s O
bow O
. O
The O
delicate O
side-fins O
, O
and O
the O
palms O
of O
his O
flukes O
, O
still O
freshly O
retained O
the O
plaited O
crumpled O
appearance O
of O
a O
baby O
’ O

ears O
newly O
arrived O
from O
foreign O
parts O
. O
“ O
Line B-LOC
! O
line B-LOC
! O
” O
cried O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
looking O
over O
the O
gunwale O
; O
“ O

” O
“ O
What O

” O
cried O
Starbuck B-CHR
. O
“ O
Look-e O
here O
, O
” O
said O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
pointing O
down O
. O
As O
when O
the O
stricken O
whale O
, O
that O
from O
the O
tub O
has O
reeled O
out O
hundreds O
of O
fathoms O
of O
rope O
; O
as O
, O
after O
deep O
sounding O
, O
he O
floats O
up O
again O
, O
and O
shows O
the O
slackened O
curling O
line O
buoyantly O
rising O
and O
spiralling O
towards O
the O
air O
; O
so O
now O
, O
Starbuck B-CHR
saw O
long O
coils O
of O
the O
umbilical O
cord O
of O
Madame B-CHR
Leviathan I-CHR
, O
by O
which O
the O
young O
cub O
seemed O
still O
tethered O
to O
its O
dam O
. O
Not O
seldom O
in O
the O
rapid O
vicissitudes O
of O
the O
chase O
, O
this O
natural O
line O
, O
with O
the O
maternal O
end O
loose O
, O
becomes O
entangled O
with O
the O
hempen O
one O
, O
so O
that O
the O
cub O
is O
thereby O
trapped O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
subtlest O
secrets O
of O
the O
seas O
seemed O
divulged O
to O
us O
in O
this O
enchanted O
pond O
. O
We O
saw O
young O
Leviathan B-CHR
amours O
in O
the O
deep O
. O
* O
* O
The O
sperm O
whale O
, O
as O
with O
all O
other O
species O
of O
the O
Leviathan B-CHR
, O
but O
unlike O
most O
other O
fish O
, O
breeds O
indifferently O
at O
all O
seasons O
; O
after O
a O
gestation O
which O
may O
probably O
be O
set O
down O
at O
nine O
months O
, O
producing O
but O
one O
at O
a O
time O
; O
though O
in O
some O
few O
known O
instances O
giving O
birth O
to O
an O
Esau B-CHR
and O
Jacob B-CHR
: O
—a O
contingency O
provided O
for O
in O
suckling O
by O
two O
teats O
, O
curiously O
situated O
, O
one O
on O
each O
side O
of O
the O
anus O
; O
but O
the O
breasts O
themselves O
extend O
upwards O
from O
that O
. O
When O
by O
chance O
these O
precious O
parts O
in O
a O
nursing O
whale O
are O
cut O
by O
the O
hunter O
’ O

The O
milk O
is O
very O
sweet O

rich O
; O
it O
has O
been O
tasted O
by O
man O
; O
it O
might O
do O
well O
with O
strawberries O

When O
overflowing O
with O
mutual O
esteem O
, O
the O
whales O
salute O
_more O
hominum_ O
. O
And O
thus O
, O
though O
surrounded O
by O
circle O
upon O
circle O
of O
consternations O
and O
affrights O
, O
did O
these O
inscrutable O
creatures O
at O
the O
centre O
freely O
and O
fearlessly O
indulge O
in O
all O
peaceful O
concernments O
; O
yea O
, O
serenely O
revelled O
in O
dalliance O
and O
delight O
. O
But O
even O
so O
, O
amid O
the O
tornadoed O
Atlantic B-LOC
of O
my O
being O
, O
do O
I O
myself O
still O
for O
ever O
centrally O
disport O
in O
mute O
calm O
; O
and O
while O
ponderous O
planets O
of O
unwaning O
woe O
revolve O
round O
me O
, O
deep O
down O
and O
deep O
inland O
there O
I O
still O
bathe O
me O
in O
eternal O
mildness O
of O
joy O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
as O
we O
thus O
lay O
entranced O
, O
the O
occasional O
sudden O
frantic O
spectacles O
in O
the O
distance O
evinced O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
other O
boats O

still O
engaged O
in O
drugging O
the O
whales O
on O
the O
frontier O
of O
the O
host O

or O
possibly O
carrying O
on O
the O

the O

where O
abundance O
of O
room O

some O
convenient O
retreats O
were O
afforded O
them O
. O
But O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
enraged O
drugged O
whales O
now O
and O
then O
blindly O
darting O
to O
and O
fro O
across O
the O
circles O
, O
was O
nothing O
to O
what O
at O
last O
met O
our O
eyes O
. O
It O
is O
sometimes O
the O
custom O
when O
fast O
to O
a O
whale O
more O
than O
commonly O
powerful O
and O
alert O
, O
to O
seek O
to O
hamstring O
him O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
by O
sundering O
or O
maiming O
his O
gigantic O
tail-tendon O
. O
It O
is O
done O
by O
darting O
a O
short-handled O
cutting-spade O
, O
to O
which O
is O
attached O
a O
rope O
for O
hauling O
it O
back O
again O
. O
A O
whale O
wounded O
( O
as O
we O
afterwards O
learned O
) O
in O
this O
part O
, O
but O
not O
effectually O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
had O
broken O
away O
from O
the O
boat O
, O
carrying O
along O
with O
him O
half O
of O
the O
harpoon O
line O
; O
and O
in O
the O
extraordinary O
agony O
of O
the O
wound O
, O
he O
was O
now O
dashing O
among O
the O
revolving O
circles O
like O
the O
lone O
mounted O
desperado O
Arnold B-CHR
, O
at O
the O
battle B-MSC
of I-MSC
Saratoga I-MSC
, O
carrying O
dismay O
wherever O
he O
went O
. O
But O
agonizing O
as O
was O
the O
wound O
of O
this O
whale O
, O
and O
an O
appalling O
spectacle O
enough O
, O
any O
way O
; O
yet O
the O
peculiar O
horror O
with O
which O
he O
seemed O
to O
inspire O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
herd O
, O
was O
owing O
to O
a O
cause O
which O
at O
first O
the O
intervening O
distance O
obscured O
from O
us O

But O
at O
length O
we O
perceived O
that O
by O
one O
of O
the O
unimaginable O
accidents O
of O
the O
fishery O
, O
this O
whale O
had O
become O
entangled O
in O
the O
harpoon-line O
that O
he O
towed O
; O
he O
had O
also O
run O
away O
with O
the O
cutting-spade O
in O
him O
; O
and O
while O
the O
free O
end O
of O
the O
rope O
attached O
to O
that O
weapon O
, O
had O
permanently O
caught O
in O
the O
coils O
of O
the O
harpoon-line O
round O
his O
tail O
, O
the O
cutting-spade O
itself O
had O
worked O
loose O
from O
his O
flesh O
. O
So O
that O
tormented O
to O
madness O
, O
he O
was O
now O
churning O
through O
the O
water O
, O
violently O
flailing O
with O
his O
flexible O
tail O
, O
and O
tossing O
the O
keen O
spade O
about O
him O
, O
wounding O
and O
murdering O
his O
own O
comrades O
. O
This O
terrific O
object O
seemed O
to O
recall O
the O
whole O
herd O
from O
their O
stationary O
fright O
. O
First O
, O
the O
whales O
forming O
the O
margin O
of O
our O
lake O
began O
to O
crowd O
a O
little O
, O
and O
tumble O
against O
each O
other O
, O
as O
if O
lifted O
by O
half O
spent O
billows O
from O
afar O
; O
then O
the O
lake O
itself O
began O
faintly O
to O
heave O
and O
swell O
; O
the O
submarine O
bridal-chambers O
and O
nurseries O
vanished O
; O
in O
more O
and O
more O
contracting O
orbits O
the O
whales O
in O
the O
more O
central O
circles O
began O
to O
swim O
in O
thickening O
clusters O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O
long O
calm O
was O
departing O
. O
A O
low O
advancing O
hum O
was O
soon O
heard O
; O
and O
then O
like O
to O
the O
tumultuous O
masses O
of O
block-ice O
when O
the O
great O
river O
Hudson B-LOC
breaks O
up O
in O
Spring O
, O
the O
entire O
host O
of O
whales O
came O
tumbling O
upon O
their O
inner O
centre O
, O
as O
if O
to O
pile O
themselves O
up O
in O
one O
common O
mountain O
. O
Instantly O
Starbuck B-CHR
and O
Queequeg B-CHR
changed O
places O
; O
Starbuck B-CHR
taking O
the O
stern O
. O
“ O
Oars O
! O
Oars O
! O
” O
he O
intensely O
whispered O
, O
seizing O
the O
helm— O
“ O
gripe O
your O
oars O
, O
and O
clutch O
your O
souls O
, O
now O
! O
My O
God O
, O
men O
, O
stand O
by O
! O
Shove O
him O
off O
, O
you O
Queequeg B-CHR
— O
the O
whale O
there O
! O
—prick O
him O
! O
—hit O
him O
! O
Stand O
up—stand O
up O
, O
and O
stay O
so O
! O
Spring O
, O
men—pull O
, O
men O
; O
never O
mind O
their O
backs—scrape O
them O
! O
—scrape O
away O
! O
” O
The O
boat O
was O
now O
all O
but O
jammed O
between O
two O
vast O
black O
bulks O
, O
leaving O
a O
narrow O
Dardanelles B-LOC
between O
their O
long O
lengths O
. O
But O
by O
desperate O
endeavor O
we O
at O
last O
shot O
into O
a O
temporary O
opening O
; O
then O
giving O
way O
rapidly O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
earnestly O
watching O
for O
another O
outlet O
. O
After O
many O
similar O
hair-breadth O
escapes O
, O
we O
at O
last O
swiftly O
glided O
into O
what O
had O
just O
been O
one O
of O
the O
outer O
circles O
, O
but O
now O
crossed O
by O
random O
whales O
, O
all O
violently O
making O
for O
one O
centre O
. O
This O
lucky O
salvation O
was O
cheaply O
purchased O
by O
the O
loss O
of O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O
s O
hat O
, O
who O
, O
while O
standing O
in O
the O
bows O
to O
prick O
the O
fugitive O
whales O
, O
had O
his O
hat O
taken O
clean O
from O
his O
head O
by O
the O
air-eddy O
made O
by O
the O
sudden O
tossing O
of O
a O
pair O
of O
broad O
flukes O
close O
by O
. O
Riotous O
and O
disordered O
as O
the O
universal O
commotion O
now O
was O
, O
it O
soon O
resolved O
itself O
into O
what O
seemed O
a O
systematic O
movement O
; O
for O
having O
clumped O
together O
at O
last O
in O
one O
dense O
body O
, O
they O
then O
renewed O
their O
onward O
flight O
with O
augmented O
fleetness O
. O
Further O
pursuit O
was O
useless O
; O
but O
the O
boats O
still O
lingered O
in O
their O
wake O
to O
pick O
up O
what O
drugged O
whales O
might O
be O
dropped O
astern O
, O
and O
likewise O
to O
secure O
one O
which O
Flask B-CHR
had O
killed O
and O
waifed O
. O
The O
waif O
is O
a O
pennoned O
pole O
, O
two O
or O
three O
of O
which O
are O
carried O
by O
every O
boat O
; O
and O
which O
, O
when O
additional O
game O
is O
at O
hand O
, O
are O
inserted O
upright O
into O
the O
floating O
body O
of O
a O
dead O
whale O
, O
both O
to O
mark O
its O
place O
on O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
also O
as O
token O
of O
prior O
possession O
, O
should O
the O
boats O
of O
any O
other O
ship O
draw O
near O
. O
The O
result O
of O
this O
lowering O
was O
somewhat O
illustrative O
of O
that O
sagacious O
saying O
in O
the O
Fishery O
, O
—the O
more O
whales O
the O
less O
fish O
. O
Of O
all O
the O
drugged O
whales O
only O
one O
was O
captured O
. O
The O
rest O
contrived O
to O
escape O
for O
the O
time O
, O
but O
only O
to O
be O
taken O
, O
as O
will O
hereafter O
be O
seen O
, O
by O
some O
other O
craft O
than O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
. O
