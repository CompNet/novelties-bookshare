During O
the O
most O
violent O
shocks O
of O
the O
Typhoon O
, O
the O
man O
at O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
jaw-bone O
tiller O
had O
several O
times O
been O
reelingly O
hurled O
to O
the O
deck O
by O
its O
spasmodic O
motions O
, O
even O
though O
preventer O
tackles O
had O
been O
attached O
to O
it—for O
they O
were O
slack—because O
some O
play O
to O
the O
tiller O
was O
indispensable O
. O
In O
a O
severe O
gale O
like O
this O
, O
while O
the O
ship O
is O
but O
a O
tossed O
shuttlecock O
to O
the O
blast O
, O
it O
is O
by O
no O
means O
uncommon O
to O
see O
the O
needles O
in O
the O
compasses O
, O
at O
intervals O
, O
go O
round O
and O
round O
. O
It O
was O
thus O
with O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
; O
at O
almost O
every O
shock O
the O
helmsman O
had O
not O
failed O
to O
notice O
the O
whirling O
velocity O
with O
which O
they O
revolved O
upon O
the O
cards O
; O
it O
is O
a O
sight O
that O
hardly O
anyone O
can O
behold O
without O
some O
sort O
of O
unwonted O
emotion O
. O
Some O
hours O
after O
midnight O
, O
the O
Typhoon O
abated O
so O
much O
, O
that O
through O
the O
strenuous O
exertions O
of O
Starbuck B-CHR
and O
Stubb—one O
engaged O
forward O
and O
the O
other O
aft—the O
shivered O
remnants O
of O
the O
jib O
and O
fore O
and O
main-top-sails O
were O
cut O
adrift O
from O
the O
spars O
, O
and O
went O
eddying O
away O
to O
leeward O
, O
like O
the O
feathers O
of O
an O
albatross O
, O
which O
sometimes O
are O
cast O
to O
the O
winds O
when O
that O
storm-tossed O
bird O
is O
on O
the O
wing O
. O
The O
three O
corresponding O
new O
sails O
were O
now O
bent O
and O
reefed O
, O
and O
a O
storm-trysail O
was O
set O
further O
aft O
; O
so O
that O
the O
ship O
soon O
went O
through O
the O
water O
with O
some O
precision O
again O
; O
and O
the O
course—for O
the O
present O
, O
East-south-east—which O
he O
was O
to O
steer O
, O
if O
practicable O
, O
was O
once O
more O
given O
to O
the O
helmsman O
. O
For O
during O
the O
violence O
of O
the O
gale O
, O
he O
had O
only O
steered O
according O
to O
its O
vicissitudes O
. O
But O
as O
he O
was O
now O
bringing O
the O
ship O
as O
near O
her O
course O
as O
possible O
, O
watching O
the O
compass O
meanwhile O
, O
lo O
! O
a O
good O
sign O
! O
the O
wind O
seemed O
coming O
round O
astern O
; O
aye O
, O
the O
foul O
breeze O
became O
fair O
! O
Instantly O
the O
yards O
were O
squared O
, O
to O
the O
lively O
song O
of O
“ O
_Ho O
! O
the O
fair O
wind O
! O
oh-ye-ho O
, O
cheerly O
men O
! O
_ O
” O
the O
crew O
singing O
for O
joy O
, O
that O
so O
promising O
an O
event O
should O
so O
soon O
have O
falsified O
the O
evil O
portents O
preceding O
it O
. O
In O
compliance O
with O
the O
standing O
order O
of O
his O
commander—to O
report O
immediately O
, O
and O
at O
any O
one O
of O
the O
twenty-four O
hours O
, O
any O
decided O
change O
in O
the O
affairs O
of O
the O
deck O
, O
— O
Starbuck B-CHR
had O
no O
sooner O
trimmed O
the O
yards O
to O
the O
breeze—however O
reluctantly O
and O
gloomily O
, O
—than O
he O
mechanically O
went O
below O
to O
apprise O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
of O
the O
circumstance O
. O
Ere O
knocking O
at O
his O
state-room O
, O
he O
involuntarily O
paused O
before O
it O
a O
moment O
. O
The O
cabin O
lamp—taking O
long O
swings O
this O
way O
and O
that—was O
burning O
fitfully O
, O
and O
casting O
fitful O
shadows O
upon O
the O
old O
man O
’ O
s O
bolted O
door O
, O
—a O
thin O
one O
, O
with O
fixed O
blinds O
inserted O
, O
in O
place O
of O
upper O
panels O
. O
The O
isolated O
subterraneousness O
of O
the O
cabin O
made O
a O
certain O
humming O
silence O
to O
reign O
there O
, O
though O
it O
was O
hooped O
round O
by O
all O
the O
roar O
of O
the O
elements O
. O
The O
loaded O
muskets O
in O
the O
rack O
were O
shiningly O
revealed O
, O
as O
they O
stood O
upright O
against O
the O
forward O
bulkhead O
. O
Starbuck B-CHR
was O
an O
honest O
, O
upright O
man O
; O
but O
out O
of O
Starbuck B-CHR
’ O
s O
heart O
, O
at O
that O
instant O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
muskets O
, O
there O
strangely O
evolved O
an O
evil O
thought O
; O
but O
so O
blent O
with O
its O
neutral O
or O
good O
accompaniments O
that O
for O
the O
instant O
he O
hardly O
knew O
it O
for O
itself O
. O
“ O
He O
would O
have O
shot O
me O
once O
, O
” O
he O
murmured O
, O
“ O
yes O
, O
there O
’ O
s O
the O
very O
musket O
that O
he O
pointed O
at O
me O
; O
—that O
one O
with O
the O
studded O
stock O
; O
let O
me O
touch O
it—lift O
it O
. O
Strange O
, O
that O
I O
, O
who O
have O
handled O
so O
many O
deadly O
lances O
, O
strange O
, O
that O
I O
should O
shake O
so O
now O
. O
Loaded O
? O
I O
must O
see O
. O
Aye O
, O
aye O
; O
and O
powder O
in O
the O
pan O
; O
—that O
’ O
s O
not O
good O
. O
Best O
spill O
it O
? O
—wait O
. O
I O
’ O
ll O
cure O
myself O
of O
this O
. O
I O
’ O
ll O
hold O
the O
musket O
boldly O
while O
I O
think.—I O
come O
to O
report O
a O
fair O
wind O
to O
him O
. O
But O
how O
fair O
? O
Fair O
for O
death O
and O
doom O
, O
—_that O
’ O
s_ O
fair O
for O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
. O
It O
’ O
s O
a O
fair O
wind O
that O
’ O
s O
only O
fair O
for O
that O
accursed O
fish.—The O
very O
tube O
he O
pointed O
at O
me O
! O
—the O
very O
one O
; O
_this_ O
one—I O
hold O
it O
here O
; O
he O
would O
have O
killed O
me O
with O
the O
very O
thing O
I O
handle O
now.—Aye O
and O
he O
would O
fain O
kill O
all O
his O
crew O
. O
Does O
he O
not O
say O
he O
will O
not O
strike O
his O
spars O
to O
any O
gale O
? O
Has O
he O
not O
dashed O
his O
heavenly O
quadrant O
? O
and O
in O
these O
same O
perilous O
seas O
, O
gropes O
he O
not O
his O
way O
by O
mere O
dead O
reckoning O
of O
the O
error-abounding O
log O
? O
and O
in O
this O
very O
Typhoon O
, O
did O
he O
not O
swear O
that O
he O
would O
have O
no O
lightning-rods O
? O
But O
shall O
this O
crazed O
old O
man O
be O
tamely O
suffered O
to O
drag O
a O
whole O
ship O
’ O
s O
company O
down O
to O
doom O
with O
him O
? O
—Yes O
, O
it O
would O
make O
him O
the O
wilful O
murderer O
of O
thirty O
men O
and O
more O
, O
if O

ship O

to O
any O
deadly O
harm O
; O
and O
come O
to O
deadly O
harm O
, O
my O
soul O
swears O
this O
ship O
will O
, O
if O
Ahab B-CHR
have O
his O
way O
. O
If O
, O
then O
, O
he O
were O
this O
instant—put O
aside O

that O
crime O

not O

Ha O

Only O

down O

more O

then O

I O
could O
not O
endure O
