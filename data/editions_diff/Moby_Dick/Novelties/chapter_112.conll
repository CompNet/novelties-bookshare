Availing O
himself O
of O
the O
mild O
, O
summer-cool O
weather O
that O
now O
reigned O
in O
these O
latitudes O
, O
and O
in O
preparation O
for O
the O
peculiarly O
active O
pursuits O
shortly O
to O
be O
anticipated O
, O
Perth B-CHR
, O
the O
begrimed O
, O
blistered O
old O
blacksmith O
, O
had O
not O
removed O
his O
portable O
forge O
to O
the O
hold O
again O
, O
after O
concluding O
his O
contributory O
work O
for O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
leg O
, O
but O
still O
retained O
it O
on O
deck O
, O
fast O
lashed O
to O
ringbolts O
by O
the O
foremast O
; O
being O
now O
almost O
incessantly O
invoked O
by O
the O
headsmen O
, O
and O
harpooneers O
, O
and O
bowsmen O
to O
do O
some O
little O
job O
for O
them O
; O
altering O
, O
or O
repairing O
, O
or O
new O
shaping O
their O
various O
weapons O
and O
boat O
furniture O
. O
Often O
he O
would O
be O
surrounded O
by O
an O
eager O
circle O
, O
all O
waiting O
to O
be O
served O
; O
holding O
boat-spades O
, O
pike-heads O
, O
harpoons O
, O
and O
lances O
, O
and O
jealously O
watching O
his O
every O
sooty O
movement O
, O
as O
he O
toiled O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
this O
old O
man O
’ O
s O
was O
a O
patient O
hammer O
wielded O
by O
a O
patient O
arm O
. O
No O
murmur O
, O
no O
impatience O
, O
no O
petulance O
did O
come O
from O
him O
. O
Silent O
, O
slow O
, O
and O
solemn O
; O
bowing O
over O
still O
further O
his O
chronically O
broken O
back O
, O
he O
toiled O
away O
, O
as O
if O
toil O
were O
life O
itself O
, O
and O
the O
heavy O
beating O
of O
his O
hammer O
the O
heavy O
beating O
of O
his O
heart O
. O
And O
so O
it O
was.—Most O
miserable O
! O
A O
peculiar O
walk O
in O
this O
old O
man O
, O
a O
certain O
slight O
but O
painful O
appearing O
yawing O
in O
his O
gait O
, O
had O
at O
an O
early O
period O
of O
the O
voyage O
excited O
the O
curiosity O
of O
the O
mariners O
. O
And O
to O
the O
importunity O
of O
their O
persisted O
questionings O
he O
had O
finally O
given O
in O
; O
and O
so O
it O
came O
to O
pass O
that O
every O
one O
now O
knew O
the O
shameful O
story O
of O
his O
wretched O
fate O
. O
Belated O
, O
and O
not O
innocently O
, O
one O
bitter O
winter O
’ O
s O
midnight O
, O
on O
the O
road O
running O
between O
two O
country O
towns O
, O
the O
blacksmith O
half-stupidly O
felt O
the O
deadly O
numbness O
stealing O
over O
him O
, O
and O
sought O
refuge O
in O
a O
leaning O
, O
dilapidated O
barn O
. O
The O
issue O
was O
, O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
extremities O
of O
both O
feet O
. O
Out O
of O
this O
revelation O
, O
part O
by O
part O
, O
at O
last O
came O
out O
the O
four O
acts O
of O
the O
gladness O
, O
and O
the O
one O
long O
, O
and O
as O
yet O
uncatastrophied O
fifth O
act O
of O
the O
grief O
of O
his O
life O
’ O
s O
drama O
. O
He O
was O
an O
old O
man O
, O
who O
, O
at O
the O
age O
of O
nearly O
sixty O
, O
had O
postponedly O
encountered O
that O
thing O
in O
sorrow O
’ O
s O
technicals O
called O
ruin O
. O
He O
had O
been O
an O
artisan O
of O
famed O
excellence O
, O
and O
with O
plenty O
to O
do O
; O
owned O
a O
house O
and O
garden O
; O
embraced O
a O
youthful O
, O
daughter-like O
, O
loving O
wife O
, O
and O
three O
blithe O
, O
ruddy O
children O
; O
every O
Sunday O
went O
to O
a O
cheerful-looking O
church O
, O
planted O
in O
a O
grove O
. O
But O
one O
night O
, O
under O
cover O
of O
darkness O
, O
and O
further O
concealed O
in O
a O
most O
cunning O
disguisement O
, O
a O
desperate O
burglar O
slid O
into O
his O
happy O
home O
, O
and O
robbed O
them O
all O
of O
everything O
. O
And O
darker O
yet O
to O
tell O
, O
the O
blacksmith O
himself O
did O
ignorantly O
conduct O
this O
burglar O
into O
his O
family O
’ O
s O
heart O
. O
It O
was O

Upon O
the O
opening O
of O
that O
fatal O
cork O
, O
forth O
flew O
the O
fiend O
, O
and O
shrivelled O
up O
his O
home O
. O
Now O
, O
for O
prudent O
, O
most O
wise O
, O
and O
economic O
reasons O
, O
the O
blacksmith O
’ O
s O
shop O
was O
in O
the O
basement O
of O
his O
dwelling O
, O
but O
with O
a O
separate O
entrance O
to O
it O
; O
so O
that O
always O
had O
the O
young O
and O
loving O
healthy O
wife O
listened O
with O
no O
unhappy O
nervousness O
, O
but O
with O
vigorous O
pleasure O
, O
to O
the O
stout O
ringing O
of O
her O
young-armed O
old O
husband O
’ O

hammer O
; O
whose O
reverberations O
, O
muffled O
by O
passing O
through O
the O
floors O
and O
walls O
, O
came O
up O
to O
her O
, O
not O
unsweetly O
, O
in O
her O
nursery O
; O
and O
so O
, O
to O
stout O
Labor O
’ O

iron O
lullaby O
, O
the O
blacksmith O
’ O

infants O
were O
rocked O
to O
slumber O

Oh O
, O
woe O
on O
woe O
! O
Oh O
, O
Death O
, O
why O
canst O
thou O
not O
sometimes O
be O
timely O
? O
Hadst O
thou O
taken O
this O
old O
blacksmith O
to O
thyself O
ere O
his O
full O
ruin O
came O
upon O
him O
, O
then O
had O
the O
young O
widow O
had O
a O
delicious O
grief O
, O
and O
her O
orphans O
a O
truly O
venerable O
, O
legendary O
sire O
to O
dream O
of O
in O
their O
after O
years O
; O
and O
all O
of O
them O
a O
care-killing O
competency O
. O
But O
Death O
plucked O
down O
some O
virtuous O
elder O
brother O
, O
on O
whose O
whistling O
daily O
toil O
solely O
hung O
the O
responsibilities O
of O
some O
other O
family O
, O
and O
left O
the O
worse O
than O
useless O
old O
man O
standing O
, O
till O
the O
hideous O
rot O
of O
life O
should O
make O
him O
easier O
to O
harvest O

Why O
tell O
the O
whole O
? O
The O
blows O
of O
the O
basement O
hammer O
every O
day O
grew O
more O
and O
more O
between O
; O
and O
each O
blow O
every O
day O
grew O
fainter O
than O
the O
last O
; O
the O
wife O
sat O
frozen O
at O
the O
window O
, O
with O
tearless O
eyes O
, O
glitteringly O
gazing O
into O
the O
weeping O
faces O
of O
her O
children O
; O
the O
bellows O
fell O
; O
the O
forge O
choked O
up O
with O
cinders O
; O
the O
house O
was O
sold O
; O
the O
mother O
dived O
down O
into O
the O
long O
church-yard O
grass O
; O
her O
children O
twice O
followed O
her O
thither O
; O
and O
the O
houseless O
, O
familyless O
old O
man O
staggered O
off O
a O
vagabond O
in O
crape O
; O
his O
every O
woe O
unreverenced O
; O
his O
grey O
head O
a O
scorn O
to O
flaxen O

Death O
seems O
the O
only O
desirable O
sequel O
for O
a O
career O
like O
this O
; O
but O
Death O
is O
only O
a O
launching O
into O
the O
region O
of O
the O
strange O

it O
