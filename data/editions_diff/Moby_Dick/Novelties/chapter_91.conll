“ O
In O
vain O
it O
was O
to O
rake O
for O
Ambergriese O
in O
the O
paunch O
of O
this O
Leviathan B-CHR
, O
insufferable O
fetor O
denying O

inquiry. O
” O
_ O
Sir B-CHR
T. I-CHR
Browne I-CHR
, O
V.E._ O
It O
was O
a O
week O
or O
two O
after O
the O
last O
whaling O
scene O
recounted O
, O
and O
when O
we O
were O
slowly O
sailing O
over O
a O
sleepy O
, O
vapory O
, O
mid-day O
sea O
, O
that O
the O
many O
noses O
on O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
deck O
proved O
more O
vigilant O
discoverers O
than O
the O
three O
pairs O
of O
eyes O
aloft O
. O
A O
peculiar O
and O
not O
very O
pleasant O
smell O
was O
smelt O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
“ O
I O
will O
bet O
something O
now O
, O
” O
said O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
“ O
that O
somewhere O
hereabouts O
are O
some O
of O
those O
drugged O
whales O
we O
tickled O
the O
other O
day O
. O
I O
thought O
they O
would O
keel O
up O
before O
long O
. O
” O
Presently O
, O
the O
vapors O
in O
advance O
slid O
aside O
; O
and O
there O
in O
the O
distance O
lay O
a O
ship O
, O
whose O
furled O
sails O
betokened O
that O
some O
sort O
of O
whale O
must O
be O
alongside O
. O
As O
we O
glided O
nearer O
, O
the O
stranger O
showed O
French B-GRP
colours O
from O
his O
peak O
; O
and O
by O
the O
eddying O
cloud O
of O
vulture O
sea-fowl O
that O
circled O
, O
and O
hovered O
, O
and O
swooped O
around O
him O
, O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
the O
whale O
alongside O
must O
be O
what O
the O
fishermen O
call O
a O
blasted O
whale O
, O
that O
is O
, O
a O
whale O
that O
has O
died O
unmolested O
on O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
so O
floated O
an O
unappropriated O
corpse O
. O
It O
may O
well O
be O
conceived O
, O
what O
an O
unsavory O
odor O
such O
a O
mass O
must O
exhale O
; O
worse O
than O
an O
Assyrian B-GRP
city O
in O
the O
plague O
, O
when O
the O
living O
are O
incompetent O
to O
bury O
the O
departed O
. O
So O
intolerable O
indeed O
is O
it O
regarded O
by O
some O
, O
that O
no O
cupidity O
could O
persuade O
them O
to O
moor O
alongside O
of O
it O
. O
Yet O
are O
there O
those O
who O
will O
still O
do O
it O
; O
notwithstanding O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
oil O
obtained O
from O
such O
subjects O
is O
of O
a O
very O
inferior O
quality O
, O
and O
by O
no O
means O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
attar-of-rose O
. O
Coming O
still O
nearer O
with O
the O
expiring O
breeze O
, O
we O
saw O
that O
the O
Frenchman B-GRP
had O
a O
second O
whale O
alongside O
; O
and O
this O
second O
whale O
seemed O
even O
more O
of O
a O
nosegay O
than O
the O
first O
. O
In O
truth O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
one O
of O
those O
problematical O
whales O
that O
seem O
to O
dry O
up O
and O
die O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
prodigious O
dyspepsia O
, O
or O
indigestion O
; O
leaving O
their O
defunct O
bodies O
almost O
entirely O
bankrupt O
of O
anything O
like O
oil O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
in O
the O
proper O
place O
we O
shall O
see O
that O
no O
knowing O
fisherman O
will O
ever O
turn O
up O
his O
nose O
at O
such O
a O
whale O
as O
this O
, O
however O
much O
he O
may O
shun O
blasted O
whales O
in O
general O
. O
The O
Pequod B-MSC
had O
now O
swept O
so O
nigh O
to O
the O
stranger O
, O
that O
Stubb B-CHR
vowed O
he O
recognised O
his O
cutting O
spade-pole O
entangled O
in O
the O
lines O
that O
were O
knotted O
round O
the O
tail O
of O
one O
of O
these O
whales O
. O
“ O
There O
’ O
s O
a O
pretty O
fellow O
, O
now O
, O
” O
he O
banteringly O
laughed O
, O
standing O
in O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
bows O
, O
“ O
there O
’ O
s O
a O
jackal O
for O
ye O
! O
I O
well O
know O
that O
these O
Crappoes O
of O
Frenchmen B-GRP
are O
but O
poor O
devils O
in O
the O
fishery O
; O
sometimes O
lowering O
their O
boats O
for O
breakers O
, O
mistaking O
them O
for O
Sperm O
Whale O
spouts O
; O
yes O
, O
and O
sometimes O
sailing O
from O
their O
port O
with O
their O
hold O
full O
of O
boxes O
of O
tallow O
candles O
, O
and O
cases O
of O
snuffers O
, O
foreseeing O
that O
all O
the O
oil O
they O
will O
get O
won O
’ O
t O
be O
enough O
to O
dip O
the O
Captain O
’ O
s O
wick O
into O
; O
aye O
, O
we O
all O
know O
these O
things O
; O
but O
look O
ye O
, O
here O
’ O
s O
a O
Crappo O
that O
is O
content O
with O
our O
leavings O
, O
the O
drugged O
whale O
there O
, O
I O
mean O
; O
aye O
, O
and O
is O
content O
too O
with O
scraping O
the O
dry O
bones O
of O
that O
other O
precious O
fish O
he O
has O
there O
. O
Poor O
devil O
! O
I O
say O
, O
pass O
round O
a O
hat O
, O
some O
one O
, O
and O
let O
’ O
s O
make O
him O
a O
present O
of O
a O
little O
oil O
for O
dear O
charity O
’ O
s O
sake O
. O
For O
what O
oil O
he O
’ O
ll O
get O
from O
that O
drugged O
whale O
there O
, O
wouldn O
’ O
t O
be O
fit O
to O
burn O
in O
a O
jail O
; O
no O
, O
not O
in O
a O
condemned O
cell O
. O
And O
as O
for O
the O
other O
whale O
, O
why O
, O
I O
’ O
ll O
agree O
to O
get O
more O
oil O
by O
chopping O
up O
and O
trying O
out O
these O
three O
masts O
of O
ours O
, O
than O
he O
’ O
ll O
get O
from O
that O
bundle O
of O
bones O
; O
though O
, O
now O
that O
I O
think O
of O
it O
, O
it O
may O
contain O
something O
worth O
a O
good O
deal O
more O
than O
oil O
; O
yes O
, O
ambergris O
. O
I O
wonder O
now O
if O
our O
old O
man O
has O
thought O
of O
that O
. O
It O
’ O
s O
worth O
trying O
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
’ O
m O
for O
it O
; O
” O
and O
so O
saying O
he O
started O
for O
the O
quarter-deck O
. O
By O
this O
time O
the O
faint O
air O
had O
become O
a O
complete O
calm O
; O
so O
that O
whether O
or O
no O
, O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
now O
fairly O
entrapped O
in O
the O
smell O
, O
with O
no O
hope O
of O
escaping O
except O
by O
its O
breezing O
up O
again O
. O
Issuing O
from O
the O
cabin O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
now O
called O
his O
boat O
’ O
s O
crew O
, O
and O
pulled O
off O
for O
the O
stranger O
. O
Drawing O
across O
her O
bow O
, O
he O
perceived O
that O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
fanciful O
French B-GRP
taste O
, O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
her O
stem-piece O
was O
carved O
in O
the O
likeness O
of O
a O
huge O
drooping O
stalk O
, O
was O
painted O
green O
, O
and O
for O
thorns O
had O
copper O
spikes O
projecting O
from O
it O
here O
and O
there O
; O
the O
whole O
terminating O
in O
a O
symmetrical O
folded O
bulb O
of O
a O
bright O
red O
colour O
. O
Upon O
her O
head O
boards O
, O
in O
large O
gilt O
letters O
, O
he O
read O
“ O
Bouton B-MSC
de I-MSC
Rose I-MSC
, O
” O
— O
Rose-button B-MSC
, O
or O
Rose-bud B-MSC
; O
and O
this O
was O
the O
romantic O
name O
of O
this O
aromatic O
ship O
. O
Though O
Stubb B-CHR
did O
not O
understand O
the O
_Bouton_ O
part O
of O
the O
inscription O
, O
yet O
the O
word O
_rose_ O
, O
and O
the O
bulbous O
figure-head O
put O
together O
, O
sufficiently O
explained O
the O
whole O
to O
him O
. O
“ O
A O
wooden O
rose-bud O
, O
eh O
? O
” O
he O
cried O
with O
his O
hand O
to O
his O
nose O
, O
“ O
that O
will O
do O
very O
well O
; O
but O
how O
like O
all O
creation O
it O
smells O
! O
” O
Now O
in O
order O
to O
hold O
direct O
communication O
with O
the O
people O
on O
deck O
, O
he O
had O
to O
pull O
round O
the O
bows O
to O
the O
starboard O
side O
, O
and O
thus O
come O
close O
to O
the O
blasted O
whale O
; O
and O
so O
talk O
over O
it O
. O
Arrived O
then O
at O
this O
spot O
, O
with O
one O
hand O
still O
to O
his O
nose O
, O
he O
bawled— O
“ O
Bouton-de-Rose B-MSC
, O
ahoy O
! O
are O
there O
any O
of O
you O
Bouton-de-Roses B-MSC
that O
speak O
English O
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
” O
rejoined O
a O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
from O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
who O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
the O
chief-mate O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
my O
Bouton-de-Rose-bud B-MSC
, O
have O
you O
seen O

White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR

” O
“ O
_What_ O

” O
“ O
The O
_White_ B-CHR

I O

call O
again O
in O
a O
minute O
. O
” O
Then O
rapidly O
pulling O
back O
towards O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
and O
seeing O
Ahab B-CHR
leaning O
over O
the O
quarter-deck O
rail O
awaiting O
his O
report O
, O
he O
moulded O
his O
two O
hands O
into O
a O
trumpet O
and O
shouted— O
“ O
No O
, O
Sir O
! O
No O
! O
” O
Upon O
which O
Ahab B-CHR
retired O
, O
and O
Stubb B-CHR
returned O
to O
the O
Frenchman B-GRP
. O
He O
now O
perceived O
that O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
, O
who O
had O
just O
got O
into O
the O
chains O
, O
and O
was O
using O
a O
cutting-spade O
, O
had O
slung O
his O
nose O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
bag O
. O
“ O
What O
’ O
s O
the O
matter O
with O
your O
nose O
, O
there O
? O
” O
said O
Stubb B-CHR
. O
“ O
Broke O
it O
? O
” O
“ O
I O
wish O

broken O

or O
that O

didn O
’ O

” O
answered O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
, O
who O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
relish O
the O
job O
he O
was O
at O
very O
much O
. O
“ O
But O

“ O

roared O
the O
Guernseyman B-GRP
, O
flying O
into O
a O
sudden O
passion O

“ O

with O
that O
he O
soon O
mounted O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
There O
a O
queer O
scene O
presented O
itself O
. O
The O
sailors O
, O
in O
tasselled O
caps O
of O
red O
worsted O
, O
were O
getting O
the O
heavy O
tackles O
in O
readiness O
for O
the O
whales O
. O
But O
they O
worked O
rather O
slow O
and O
talked O
very O
fast O
, O
and O
seemed O
in O
anything O
but O
a O
good O
humor O
. O
All O
their O
noses O
upwardly O
projected O
from O
their O
faces O
like O
so O
many O
jib-booms O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
pairs O
of O
them O
would O
drop O
their O
work O
, O
and O
run O
up O
to O
the O
mast-head O
to O
get O
some O
fresh O
air O
. O
Some O
thinking O
they O
would O
catch O
the O
plague O
, O
dipped O
oakum O
in O
coal-tar O
, O
and O
at O
intervals O
held O
it O
to O
their O
nostrils O
. O
Others O
having O
broken O
the O
stems O
of O
their O
pipes O
almost O
short O
off O
at O
the O
bowl O
, O
were O
vigorously O
puffing O
tobacco-smoke O
, O
so O
that O
it O
constantly O
filled O
their O
olfactories O
. O
Stubb B-CHR
was O
struck O
by O
a O
shower O
of O
outcries O
and O
anathemas O
proceeding O
from O
the O
Captain O
’ O
s O
round-house O
abaft O
; O
and O
looking O
in O
that O
direction O
saw O
a O
fiery O
face O
thrust O
from O
behind O
the O
door O
, O
which O
was O
held O
ajar O
from O
within O
. O
This O
was O
the O
tormented O
surgeon O
, O
who O
, O
after O
in O
vain O
remonstrating O
against O
the O
proceedings O
of O
the O
day O
, O
had O
betaken O
himself O
to O
the O
Captain O
’ O
s O
round-house O
( O
_cabinet_ O
he O
called O
it O
) O
to O
avoid O
the O
pest O
; O
but O
still O
, O
could O
not O
help O
yelling O
out O
his O
entreaties O
and O
indignations O
at O
times O
. O
Marking O
all O
this O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
argued O
well O
for O
his O
scheme O
, O
and O
turning O
to O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
had O
a O
little O
chat O
with O
him O
, O
during O
which O
the O
stranger O
mate O
expressed O
his O
detestation O
of O
his O
Captain O
as O
a O
conceited O
ignoramus O
, O
who O
had O
brought O
them O
all O
into O
so O
unsavory O
and O
unprofitable O
a O
pickle O
. O
Sounding O
him O
carefully O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
further O
perceived O
that O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
had O
not O
the O
slightest O
suspicion O
concerning O
the O
ambergris O
. O
He O
therefore O
held O
his O
peace O
on O
that O
head O
, O
but O
otherwise O
was O
quite O
frank O
and O
confidential O
with O
him O
, O
so O
that O
the O
two O
quickly O
concocted O
a O
little O
plan O
for O
both O
circumventing O
and O
satirizing O
the O
Captain O
, O
without O
his O
at O
all O
dreaming O
of O
distrusting O
their O
sincerity O
. O
According O
to O
this O
little O
plan O
of O
theirs O
, O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
, O
under O
cover O
of O
an O
interpreter O
’ O
s O
office O
, O
was O
to O
tell O
the O
Captain O
what O
he O
pleased O
, O
but O
as O
coming O
from O
Stubb B-CHR
; O
and O
as O
for O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
he O
was O
to O
utter O
any O
nonsense O
that O
should O
come O
uppermost O
in O
him O
during O
the O
interview O
. O
By O
this O
time O
their O
destined O
victim O
appeared O
from O
his O
cabin O
. O
He O
was O
a O
small O
and O
dark O
, O
but O
rather O
delicate O
looking O
man O
for O
a O
sea-captain O
, O
with O
large O
whiskers O
and O
moustache O
, O
however O
; O
and O
wore O
a O
red O
cotton O
velvet O
vest O
with O
watch-seals O
at O
his O
side O
. O
To O
this O
gentleman O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
was O
now O
politely O
introduced O
by O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
, O
who O
at O
once O
ostentatiously O
put O
on O
the O
aspect O
of O
interpreting O
between O
them O
. O
“ O
What O
shall O
I O
say O
to O
him O
first O
? O
” O
said O
he O
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
” O
said O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
eyeing O
the O
velvet O
vest O
and O
the O
watch O
and O
seals O
, O
“ O
you O
may O
as O
well O
begin O
by O
telling O
him O
that O
he O
looks O
a O
sort O
of O
babyish O
to O
me O
, O
though O
I O
don O
’ O
t O
pretend O
to O
be O
a O
judge O
. O
” O
“ O
He O
says O
, O
Monsieur O
, O
” O
said O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
, O
in O
French B-GRP
, O
turning O
to O
his O
captain O
, O
“ O
that O
only O
yesterday O
his O
ship O
spoke O
a O
vessel O
, O
whose O
captain O
and O
chief-mate O
, O
with O
six O
sailors O
, O
had O
all O
died O
of O
a O
fever O
caught O
from O
a O
blasted O
whale O
they O
had O
brought O
alongside O
. O
” O
Upon O
this O
the O
captain O
started O
, O
and O
eagerly O
desired O
to O
know O
more O
. O
“ O
What O
now O
? O
” O
said O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
to O
Stubb B-CHR
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
since O
he O
takes O
it O
so O
easy O
, O
tell O
him O
that O
now O
I O
have O
eyed O
him O
carefully O
, O
I O
’ O
m O
quite O
certain O
that O
he O
’ O
s O
no O
more O
fit O
to O
command O
a O
whale-ship O
than O
a O
St. B-LOC
Jago I-LOC
monkey O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
tell O
him O
from O
me O
he O
’ O
s O
a O
baboon O
. O
” O
“ O
He O
vows O
and O
declares O
, O
Monsieur O
, O
that O
the O
other O
whale O
, O
the O
dried O
one O
, O
is O
far O
more O
deadly O
than O
the O
blasted O
one O
; O
in O
fine O
, O
Monsieur O
, O
he O
conjures O
us O
, O
as O
we O
value O
our O
lives O
, O
to O
cut O
loose O
from O
these O
fish O
. O
” O
Instantly O
the O
captain O
ran O
forward O
, O
and O
in O
a O
loud O
voice O
commanded O
his O
crew O
to O
desist O
from O
hoisting O
the O
cutting-tackles O
, O
and O
at O
once O
cast O
loose O
the O
cables O
and O
chains O
confining O
the O
whales O
to O
the O
ship O
. O
“ O
What O
now O
? O
” O
said O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
, O
when O
the O
Captain O
had O
returned O
to O
them O
. O
“ O
Why O
, O
let O
me O
see O
; O
yes O
, O
you O
may O
as O
well O
tell O
him O
now O
that—that—in O
fact O
, O
tell O
him O
I O
’ O
ve O
diddled O
him O
, O
and O
( O
aside O
to O
himself O
) O
perhaps O
somebody O
else O
. O
” O
“ O
He O
says O
, O
Monsieur O
, O
that O
he O
’ O
s O
very O
happy O
to O
have O
been O
of O
any O
service O
to O
us O
. O
” O
Hearing O
this O
, O
the O
captain O
vowed O
that O
they O
were O
the O
grateful O
parties O
( O
meaning O
himself O
and O
mate O
) O
and O
concluded O
by O
inviting O
Stubb B-CHR
down O
into O
his O
cabin O
to O
drink O
a O
bottle O
of O
Bordeaux B-MSC
. O
“ O
He O
wants O
you O
to O
take O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
with O
him O
, O
” O
said O
the O
interpreter O
. O
“ O
Thank O
him O
heartily O
; O
but O
tell O
him O
it O
’ O
s O
against O
my O
principles O
to O
drink O
with O
the O
man O
I O
’ O
ve O
diddled O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
tell O
him O
I O
must O
go O
. O
” O
“ O
He O
says O
, O
Monsieur O
, O
that O
his O
principles O
won O
’ O
t O
admit O
of O
his O
drinking O
; O
but O
that O
if O
Monsieur O
wants O
to O
live O
another O
day O
to O
drink O
, O
then O
Monsieur O
had O
best O
drop O
all O
four O
boats O
, O
and O
pull O
the O
ship O
away O
from O
these O
whales O
, O
for O
it O
’ O
s O
so O
calm O
they O
won O
’ O
t O
drift O
. O
” O
By O
this O
time O
Stubb B-CHR
was O
over O
the O
side O
, O
and O
getting O
into O
his O
boat O
, O
hailed O
the O
Guernsey-man B-GRP
to O
this O
effect O
, O
—that O
having O
a O
long O
tow-line O
in O
his O
boat O
, O
he O
would O
do O
what O
he O
could O
to O
help O
them O
, O
by O
pulling O
out O
the O
lighter O
whale O
of O
the O
two O
from O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
side O
. O
While O
the O
Frenchman B-GRP
’ O
s O
boats O
, O
then O
, O
were O
engaged O
in O
towing O
the O
ship O
one O
way O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
benevolently O
towed O
away O
at O
his O
whale O
the O
other O
way O
, O
ostentatiously O
slacking O
out O
a O
most O
unusually O
long O
tow-line O
. O
Presently O
a O
breeze O
sprang O
up O
; O
Stubb B-CHR
feigned O
to O
cast O
off O
from O
the O
whale O
; O
hoisting O
his O
boats O
, O
the O
Frenchman B-GRP
soon O
increased O
his O
distance O
, O
while O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
slid O
in O
between O
him O
and O
Stubb B-CHR
’ O
s O
whale O
. O
Whereupon O
Stubb B-CHR
quickly O
pulled O
to O
the O
floating O
body O
, O
and O
hailing O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
to O
give O
notice O
of O
his O
intentions O
, O
at O
once O
proceeded O
to O
reap O
the O
fruit O
of O
his O
unrighteous O
cunning O
. O
Seizing O
his O
sharp O
boat-spade O
, O
he O
commenced O
an O
excavation O
in O
the O
body O
, O
a O
little O
behind O
the O
side O
fin O
. O
You O
would O
almost O
have O
thought O
he O
was O
digging O
a O
cellar O
there O
in O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
when O
at O
length O
his O
spade O
struck O
against O
the O
gaunt O
ribs O
, O
it O
was O
like O
turning O
up O
old O
Roman B-GRP
tiles O
and O
pottery O
buried O
in O
fat O
English B-GRP
loam O
. O
His O
boat O
’ O
s O
crew O
were O
all O
in O
high O
excitement O
, O
eagerly O
helping O
their O
chief O
, O
and O
looking O
as O
anxious O
as O
gold-hunters O
. O
And O
all O
the O
time O
numberless O
fowls O
were O
diving O
, O
and O
ducking O
, O
and O
screaming O
, O
and O
yelling O
, O
and O
fighting O
around O
them O
. O
Stubb B-CHR
was O
beginning O
to O
look O
disappointed O
, O
especially O
as O
the O
horrible O
nosegay O
increased O
, O
when O
suddenly O
from O
out O
the O
very O
heart O
of O
this O
plague O
, O
there O
stole O
a O
faint O
stream O
of O
perfume O
, O
which O
flowed O
through O
the O
tide O
of O
bad O
smells O
without O
being O
absorbed O
by O
it O
, O
as O
one O
river O
will O
flow O
into O
and O
then O
along O
with O
another O
, O
without O
at O
all O
blending O
with O
it O
for O
a O
time O
. O
“ O
I O
have O
it O
, O
I O
have O
it O
, O
” O
cried O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
with O
delight O
, O
striking O
something O
in O
the O
subterranean O
regions O
, O
“ O
a O
purse O
! O
a O
purse O
! O
” O
Dropping O
his O
spade O
, O
he O
thrust O
both O
hands O
in O
, O
and O
drew O
out O
handfuls O
of O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
ripe O
Windsor B-LOC
soap O
, O
or O
rich O
mottled O
old O
cheese O
; O
very O
unctuous O
and O
savory O
withal O
. O
You O
might O
easily O
dent O
it O
with O
your O
thumb O
; O
it O
is O
of O
a O
hue O
between O
yellow O
and O
ash O
colour O
. O
And O
this O
, O
good O
friends O
, O
is O
ambergris O
, O
worth O
a O
gold O
guinea O
an O
ounce O
to O
any O
druggist O
. O
Some O
six O
handfuls O
were O
obtained O
; O
but O
more O
was O
unavoidably O
lost O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
still O
more O
, O
perhaps O
, O
might O
have O
been O
secured O
were O
it O
not O
for O
impatient O
Ahab B-CHR

loud O
command O

desist O
, O

come O
on O
board O

bid O
them O
good O
