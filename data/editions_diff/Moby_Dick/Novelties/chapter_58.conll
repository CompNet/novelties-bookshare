Steering O
north-eastward O
from O
the O
Crozetts B-LOC
, O
we O
fell O
in O
with O
vast O
meadows O
of O
brit O
, O
the O
minute O
, O
yellow O
substance O
, O
upon O
which O
the O
Right O
Whale O
largely O
feeds O
. O
For O
leagues O
and O
leagues O
it O
undulated O
round O
us O
, O
so O
that O
we O
seemed O
to O
be O
sailing O
through O
boundless O
fields O
of O
ripe O
and O
golden O
wheat O
. O
On O
the O
second O
day O
, O
numbers O
of O
Right O
Whales O
were O
seen O
, O
who O
, O
secure O
from O
the O
attack O
of O
a O
Sperm O
Whaler O
like O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
with O
open O
jaws O
sluggishly O
swam O
through O
the O
brit O
, O
which O
, O
adhering O
to O
the O
fringing O
fibres O
of O
that O
wondrous O
Venetian B-GRP
blind O
in O
their O
mouths O
, O
was O
in O
that O
manner O
separated O
from O
the O
water O
that O
escaped O
at O
the O
lip O
. O
As O
morning O
mowers O
, O
who O
side O
by O
side O
slowly O
and O
seethingly O
advance O
their O
scythes O
through O
the O
long O
wet O
grass O
of O
marshy O
meads O
; O
even O
so O
these O
monsters O
swam O
, O
making O
a O
strange O
, O
grassy O
, O
cutting O
sound O
; O
and O
leaving O
behind O
them O
endless O
swaths O
of O
blue O
upon O
the O
yellow O
sea O
. O

That O
part O
of O
the O
sea O
known O
among O
whalemen O
as O
the O
“ O
Brazil B-LOC
Banks I-LOC
” O
does O
not O
bear O
that O
name O
as O
the O
Banks B-LOC
of I-LOC
Newfoundland I-LOC
do O
, O
because O
of O
there O
being O
shallows O
and O
soundings O
there O
, O
but O
because O
of O
this O
remarkable O
meadow-like O
appearance O
, O
caused O
by O
the O
vast O
drifts O
of O
brit O
continually O
floating O
in O
those O
latitudes O
, O
where O
the O
Right O
Whale O
is O
often O
chased O
. O
But O
it O
was O
only O
the O
sound O
they O
made O
as O
they O
parted O
the O
brit O
which O
at O
all O
reminded O
one O
of O
mowers O
. O
Seen O
from O
the O
mast-heads O
, O
especially O
when O
they O
paused O
and O
were O
stationary O
for O
a O
while O
, O
their O
vast O
black O
forms O
looked O
more O
like O
lifeless O
masses O
of O
rock O
than O
anything O
else O
. O
And O
as O
in O
the O
great O
hunting O
countries O
of O
India B-LOC
, O
the O
stranger O
at O
a O
distance O
will O
sometimes O
pass O
on O
the O
plains O
recumbent O
elephants O
without O
knowing O
them O
to O
be O
such O
, O
taking O
them O
for O
bare O
, O
blackened O
elevations O
of O
the O
soil O
; O
even O
so O
, O
often O
, O
with O
him O
, O
who O
for O
the O
first O
time O
beholds O
this O
species O
of O
the O
leviathans O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
And O
even O
when O
recognised O
at O
last O
, O
their O
immense O
magnitude O
renders O
it O
very O
hard O
really O
to O
believe O
that O
such O
bulky O
masses O
of O
overgrowth O
can O
possibly O
be O
instinct O
, O
in O
all O
parts O
, O
with O
the O
same O
sort O
of O
life O
that O
lives O
in O
a O
dog O
or O
a O
horse O
. O
Indeed O
, O
in O
other O
respects O
, O
you O
can O
hardly O
regard O
any O
creatures O
of O
the O
deep O
with O
the O
same O
feelings O
that O
you O
do O
those O
of O
the O
shore O
. O
For O
though O
some O
old O
naturalists O
have O
maintained O
that O
all O
creatures O
of O
the O
land O
are O
of O
their O
kind O
in O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
though O
taking O
a O
broad O
general O
view O
of O
the O
thing O
, O
this O
may O
very O
well O
be O
; O
yet O
coming O
to O
specialties O
, O
where O
, O
for O
example O
, O
does O
the O
ocean O
furnish O
any O
fish O
that O
in O
disposition O
answers O
to O
the O
sagacious O
kindness O
of O
the O
dog O
? O
The O
accursed O
shark O
alone O
can O
in O
any O
generic O
respect O
be O
said O
to O
bear O
comparative O
analogy O
to O
him O
. O
But O
though O
, O
to O
landsmen O
in O
general O
, O
the O
native O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
seas O
have O
ever O
been O
regarded O
with O
emotions O
unspeakably O
unsocial O
and O
repelling O
; O
though O
we O
know O
the O
sea O
to O
be O
an O
everlasting O
terra O
incognita O
, O
so O
that O
Columbus B-CHR
sailed O
over O
numberless O
unknown O
worlds O
to O
discover O
his O
one O
superficial O
western O
one O
; O
though O
, O
by O
vast O
odds O
, O
the O
most O
terrific O
of O
all O
mortal O
disasters O
have O
immemorially O
and O
indiscriminately O
befallen O
tens O
and O
hundreds O
of O
thousands O
of O
those O
who O
have O
gone O
upon O
the O
waters O
; O
though O
but O
a O
moment O
’ O

consideration O
will O
teach O
, O
that O
however O
baby O
man O
may O
brag O
of O
his O
science O
and O
skill O
, O
and O
however O
much O
, O
in O
a O
flattering O
future O
, O
that O
science O
and O
skill O
may O
augment O
; O
yet O
for O
ever O
and O
for O
ever O
, O
to O
the O
crack O
of O
doom O
, O
the O
sea O
will O
insult O
and O
murder O
him O
, O
and O
pulverize O
the O
stateliest O

nevertheless O
, O
by O
the O
continual O
repetition O
of O
these O
very O
impressions O
, O
man O
has O
lost O
that O
sense O
of O
the O
full O
awfulness O
of O
the O
sea O
which O
aboriginally O
belongs O
to O
it O
. O
The O
first O
boat O
we O
read O
of O
, O
floated O
on O
an O
ocean O
, O
that O
with O
Portuguese B-GRP
vengeance O
had O
whelmed O
a O
whole O
world O
without O
leaving O
so O
much O
as O
a O
widow O
. O
That O
same O
ocean O
rolls O
now O
; O
that O
same O
ocean O
destroyed O
the O
wrecked O
ships O
of O
last O
year O
. O
Yea O
, O
foolish O
mortals O
, O
Noah B-CHR
’ O

flood O

subsided O

two O
thirds O
of O
the O

world O
it O
yet O
covers O

Wherein O
differ O
the O
sea O
and O
the O
land O
, O
that O
a O
miracle O
upon O
one O
is O
not O
a O
miracle O
upon O
the O
other O
? O
Preternatural O
terrors O
rested O
upon O
the O
Hebrews B-GRP
, O
when O
under O
the O
feet O
of O
Korah B-CHR
and O
his O
company O
the O
live O
ground O
opened O
and O
swallowed O
them O
up O
for O
ever O
; O
yet O
not O
a O
modern O
sun O
ever O
sets O
, O
but O
in O
precisely O
the O
same O
manner O
the O
live O
sea O
swallows O
up O
ships O
and O
crews O
. O
But O
not O
only O
is O
the O
sea O
such O
a O
foe O
to O
man O
who O
is O
an O
alien O
to O
it O
, O
but O
it O
is O
also O
a O
fiend O
to O
its O
own O
off-spring O
; O
worse O
than O
the O
Persian B-GRP
host O
who O
murdered O
his O
own O
guests O
; O
sparing O
not O
the O
creatures O
which O
itself O
hath O
spawned O
. O
Like O
a O
savage O
tigress O
that O
tossing O
in O
the O
jungle O
overlays O
her O
own O
cubs O
, O
so O
the O
sea O
dashes O
even O
the O
mightiest O
whales O
against O
the O
rocks O
, O
and O
leaves O
them O
there O
side O
by O
side O
with O
the O
split O
wrecks O
of O
ships O
. O
No O
mercy O
, O
no O
power O
but O
its O
own O
controls O
it O
. O
Panting O
and O
snorting O
like O
a O
mad O
battle O
steed O
that O
has O
lost O
its O
rider O
, O
the O
masterless O
ocean O
overruns O
the O
globe O
. O
Consider O
the O
subtleness O
of O
the O
sea O
; O
how O
its O
most O
dreaded O
creatures O
glide O
under O
water O
, O
unapparent O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
and O
treacherously O
hidden O
beneath O
the O
loveliest O
tints O
of O
azure O
. O
Consider O
also O
the O
devilish O
brilliance O
and O
beauty O
of O
many O
of O
its O
most O
remorseless O
tribes O
, O
as O
the O
dainty O
embellished O
shape O
of O
many O
species O
of O
sharks O
. O
Consider O
, O
once O
more O
, O
the O
universal O
cannibalism O
of O
the O
sea O
; O
all O
whose O
creatures O
prey O
upon O
each O
other O
, O
carrying O
on O
eternal O
war O
since O
the O
world O
began O
. O
Consider O
all O
this O
; O
and O
then O
turn O
to O
this O
green O
, O
gentle O
, O
and O
most O
docile O
earth O
; O
consider O
them O
both O
, O
the O
sea O
and O
the O
land O
; O
and O
do O
you O
not O
find O
a O
strange O
analogy O
to O
something O
in O
yourself O
? O
For O
as O
this O
appalling O
ocean O
surrounds O
the O
verdant O
land O
, O
so O
in O
the O
soul O
of O
man O
there O
lies O
one O
insular O
Tahiti B-LOC
, O
full O
of O
peace O
and O
joy O
, O
but O
encompassed O
by O
all O
the O
horrors O
of O
the O
half O
known O
life O
. O
God O
keep O
thee O
! O
Push O
not O
off O
from O
that O
isle O
, O
thou O
canst O
never O
return O
