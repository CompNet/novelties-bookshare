According O
to O
usage O
they O
were O
pumping O
the O
ship O
next O
morning O
; O
and O
lo O
! O
no O
inconsiderable O
oil O
came O
up O
with O
the O
water O
; O
the O
casks O
below O
must O
have O
sprung O
a O
bad O
leak O
. O
Much O
concern O
was O
shown O
; O
and O
Starbuck B-CHR
went O
down O
into O
the O
cabin O
to O
report O
this O
unfavourable O
affair O
. O
* O
* O
In O
Sperm-whalemen O
with O
any O
considerable O
quantity O
of O
oil O
on O
board O
, O
it O
is O
a O
regular O
semi-weekly O
duty O
to O
conduct O
a O
hose O
into O
the O
hold O
, O
and O
drench O
the O
casks O
with O
sea-water O
; O
which O
afterwards O
, O
at O
varying O
intervals O
, O
is O
removed O
by O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
pumps O
. O
Hereby O
the O
casks O
are O
sought O
to O
be O
kept O
damply O
tight O
; O
while O
by O
the O
changed O
character O
of O
the O
withdrawn O
water O
, O
the O
mariners O
readily O
detect O
any O
serious O
leakage O
in O
the O
precious O
cargo O
. O
Now O
, O
from O
the O
South B-LOC
and O
West B-LOC
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
drawing O
nigh O
to O
Formosa B-LOC
and O
the O
Bashee B-LOC
Isles I-LOC
, O
between O
which O
lies O
one O
of O
the O
tropical O
outlets O
from O
the O
China B-LOC
waters O
into O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
. O
And O
so O
Starbuck B-CHR
found O
Ahab B-CHR
with O
a O
general O
chart O
of O
the O
oriental O
archipelagoes O
spread O
before O
him O
; O
and O
another O
separate O
one O
representing O
the O
long O
eastern O
coasts O
of O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
islands I-LOC
— O
Niphon I-LOC
, O
Matsmai B-LOC
, O
and O
Sikoke B-LOC
. O
With O
his O
snow-white O
new O
ivory O
leg O
braced O
against O
the O
screwed O
leg O
of O
his O
table O
, O
and O
with O
a O
long O
pruning-hook O
of O
a O
jack-knife O
in O
his O
hand O
, O
the O
wondrous O
old O
man O
, O
with O
his O
back O
to O
the O
gangway O
door O
, O
was O
wrinkling O
his O
brow O
, O
and O
tracing O
his O
old O
courses O
again O
. O
“ O
Who O
’ O
s O
there O
? O
” O
hearing O
the O
footstep O
at O
the O
door O

not O
turning O

it O

“ O
Captain B-CHR

said O
the O
reddening O
mate O
, O
moving O
further O
into O
the O
cabin O
, O
with O
a O
daring O
so O
strangely O
respectful O
and O
cautious O
that O
it O
almost O
seemed O
not O
only O
every O
way O
seeking O
to O
avoid O
the O
slightest O
outward O
manifestation O
of O
itself O
, O
but O
within O
also O
seemed O
more O
than O
half O
distrustful O
of O
itself O
; O
“ O
A O
better O
man O
than O

might O

pass O

enough O

” O
“ O

, O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
? O
” O
Ahab B-CHR
seized O
a O
loaded O
musket O
from O
the O
rack O
( O
forming O
part O
of O
most O
South-Sea-men B-GRP
’ O
s O
cabin O
furniture O
) O
, O
and O
pointing O
it O
towards O
Starbuck B-CHR
, O
exclaimed O
: O
“ O
There O
is O
one O
God B-CHR
that O
is O
Lord O
over O

earth O

one O
Captain O
that O
is O
lord O
over O

Pequod B-MSC
. O
— O
On O
deck O
! O
” O
For O
an O
instant O
in O
the O
flashing O
eyes O
of O
the O
mate O
, O
and O
his O
fiery O
cheeks O
, O
you O
would O
have O
almost O
thought O
that O
he O
had O
really O
received O
the O
blaze O
of O
the O
levelled O
tube O
. O
But O
, O
mastering O
his O
emotion O
, O
he O
half O
calmly O
rose O
, O
and O
as O
he O
quitted O
the O
cabin O
, O
paused O
for O
an O
instant O
and O
said O
: O
“ O
Thou O
hast O
outraged O
, O
not O
insulted O
me O
, O
sir O
; O
but O
for O
that O
I O
ask O
thee O
not O
to O
beware O
of O
Starbuck B-CHR
; O
thou O
wouldst O
but O
laugh O
; O
but O
let O
Ahab B-CHR
beware O
of O
Ahab B-CHR
; O
beware O
of O
thyself O
, O
old O
man O
. O
” O
“ O
He O
waxes O
brave O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
obeys O
; O
most O
careful O
bravery O
that O
! O
” O
murmured O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
as O
Starbuck B-CHR
disappeared O
. O
“ O
What O
’ O
s O
that O
he O
said O
— O
Ahab B-CHR
beware O
of O
Ahab B-CHR
— O
there O
’ O
s O
something O
there O
! O
” O
Then O
unconsciously O
using O
the O
musket O
for O
a O
staff O
, O
with O
an O
iron O
brow O
he O
paced O
to O
and O
fro O
in O
the O
little O
cabin O
; O
but O
presently O
the O
thick O
plaits O
of O
his O
forehead O
relaxed O
, O
and O
returning O
the O
gun O
to O
the O
rack O
, O
he O
went O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
“ O
Thou O
art O
but O
too O
good O
a O
fellow O
, O
Starbuck B-CHR
, O
” O
he O
said O
lowly O
to O
the O
mate O
; O
then O
raising O
his O
voice O
to O
the O
crew O
: O
“ O
Furl O
the O
t O
’ O
gallant-sails O
, O
and O
close-reef O
the O
top-sails O
, O
fore O
and O
aft O
; O
back O
the O
main-yard O
; O
up O
Burton O
, O
and O
break O
out O
in O
the O
main-hold O
. O
” O
It O
were O
perhaps O
vain O
to O
surmise O
exactly O
why O
it O
was O
, O
that O
as O
respecting O
Starbuck B-CHR
, O
Ahab B-CHR
thus O
acted O
. O
It O
may O
have O
been O
a O
flash O
of O
honesty O
in O
him O
; O
or O
mere O
prudential O
policy O
which O
, O
under O
the O
circumstance O
, O
imperiously O
forbade O
the O
slightest O
symptom O
of O
open O
disaffection O
, O
however O
transient O
, O
in O
the O
important O
chief O
officer O
of O
his O
ship O
. O
However O
it O
was O
, O
his O
orders O
were O
executed O
; O

the O
Burtons O
were O
hoisted O
