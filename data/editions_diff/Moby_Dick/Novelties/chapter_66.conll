When O
in O
the O
Southern O
Fishery O
, O
a O
captured O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
after O
long O
and O
weary O
toil O
, O
is O
brought O
alongside O
late O
at O
night O
, O
it O
is O
not O
, O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
at O
least O
, O
customary O
to O
proceed O
at O
once O
to O
the O
business O
of O
cutting O
him O
in O
. O
For O
that O
business O
is O
an O
exceedingly O
laborious O
one O
; O
is O
not O
very O
soon O
completed O
; O
and O
requires O
all O
hands O
to O
set O
about O
it O
. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
common O
usage O
is O
to O
take O
in O
all O
sail O
; O
lash O
the O
helm O
a O
’ O
lee O
; O
and O
then O
send O
every O
one O
below O
to O
his O
hammock O
till O
daylight O
, O
with O
the O
reservation O
that O
, O
until O
that O
time O
, O
anchor-watches O
shall O
be O
kept O
; O
that O
is O
, O
two O
and O
two O
for O
an O
hour O
, O
each O
couple O
, O
the O
crew O
in O
rotation O
shall O
mount O
the O
deck O
to O
see O
that O
all O
goes O
well O
. O
But O
sometimes O
, O
especially O
upon O
the O
Line B-LOC
in O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
, O
this O
plan O
will O
not O
answer O
at O
all O
; O
because O
such O
incalculable O
hosts O
of O
sharks O
gather O
round O
the O
moored O
carcase O
, O
that O
were O
he O
left O
so O
for O
six O
hours O
, O
say O
, O
on O
a O
stretch O
, O
little O
more O
than O
the O
skeleton O
would O
be O
visible O
by O
morning O
. O
In O
most O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
ocean O
, O
however O
, O
where O
these O
fish O
do O
not O
so O
largely O
abound O
, O
their O
wondrous O
voracity O
can O
be O
at O
times O
considerably O
diminished O
, O
by O
vigorously O
stirring O
them O
up O
with O
sharp O
whaling-spades O
, O
a O
procedure O
notwithstanding O
, O
which O
, O
in O
some O
instances O
, O
only O
seems O
to O
tickle O
them O
into O
still O
greater O
activity O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
thus O
in O
the O
present O
case O
with O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
sharks O
; O
though O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
any O
man O
unaccustomed O
to O
such O
sights O
, O
to O
have O
looked O
over O
her O
side O
that O
night O
, O
would O
have O
almost O
thought O
the O
whole O
round O
sea O
was O
one O
huge O
cheese O
, O
and O
those O
sharks O
the O
maggots O
in O
it O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
upon O
Stubb B-CHR
setting O
the O
anchor-watch O
after O
his O
supper O
was O
concluded O
; O
and O
when O
, O
accordingly O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
and O
a O
forecastle O
seaman O
came O
on O
deck O
, O
no O
small O
excitement O
was O
created O
among O
the O
sharks O
; O
for O
immediately O
suspending O
the O
cutting O
stages O
over O
the O
side O
, O
and O
lowering O
three O
lanterns O
, O
so O
that O
they O
cast O
long O
gleams O
of O
light O
over O
the O
turbid O
sea O
, O
these O
two O
mariners O
, O
darting O
their O
long O
whaling-spades O
, O
kept O
up O
an O
incessant O
murdering O
of O
the O
sharks O
, O
* O
by O
striking O
the O
keen O
steel O
deep O
into O
their O
skulls O
, O
seemingly O
their O
only O
vital O
part O
. O
But O
in O
the O
foamy O
confusion O
of O
their O
mixed O
and O
struggling O
hosts O
, O
the O
marksmen O
could O
not O
always O
hit O
their O
mark O
; O
and O
this O
brought O
about O
new O
revelations O
of O
the O
incredible O
ferocity O
of O
the O
foe O
. O
They O
viciously O
snapped O
, O
not O
only O
at O
each O
other O
’ O
s O
disembowelments O
, O
but O
like O
flexible O
bows O
, O
bent O
round O
, O
and O
bit O
their O
own O
; O
till O
those O
entrails O
seemed O
swallowed O
over O
and O
over O
again O
by O
the O
same O
mouth O
, O
to O
be O
oppositely O
voided O
by O
the O
gaping O
wound O
. O
Nor O
was O
this O
all O
. O
It O
was O
unsafe O
to O
meddle O
with O
the O
corpses O
and O
ghosts O
of O
these O
creatures O
. O
A O
sort O
of O
generic O
or O
Pantheistic O
vitality O
seemed O
to O
lurk O
in O
their O
very O
joints O
and O
bones O
, O
after O
what O
might O
be O
called O
the O
individual O
life O
had O
departed O
. O
Killed O
and O
hoisted O
on O
deck O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
his O
skin O
, O
one O
of O
these O
sharks O
almost O
took O
poor O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O
s O
hand O
off O
, O
when O
he O
tried O
to O
shut O
down O
the O
dead O
lid O
of O
his O
murderous O
jaw O
. O
* O
The O
whaling-spade O
used O
for O
cutting-in O
is O
made O
of O
the O
very O
best O
steel O
; O
is O
about O
the O
bigness O
of O
a O
man O
’ O
s O
spread O
hand O
; O
and O
in O
general O
shape O
, O
corresponds O
to O
the O
garden O
implement O
after O
which O
it O
is O
named O
; O
only O
its O
sides O
are O
perfectly O
flat O
, O
and O
its O
upper O
end O
considerably O
narrower O
than O
the O
lower O
. O
This O
weapon O
is O
always O
kept O
as O
sharp O
as O
possible O
; O
and O
when O
being O
used O
is O
occasionally O
honed O
, O
just O
like O
a O
razor O
. O
In O
its O
socket O
, O
a O
stiff O
pole O
, O
from O
twenty O
to O
thirty O
feet O
long O
, O
is O
inserted O
for O
a O
handle O
. O
“ O
Queequeg O
no O
care O
what O
god O
made O
him O
shark O
, O
” O
said O
the O
savage O
, O
agonizingly O
lifting O
his O
hand O
up O
and O
down O
; O
“ O
wedder O
Fejee B-GRP
god O
or O
Nantucket B-LOC
god O
; O
but O
de O
god O
wat O
made O
shark O
must O
be O
