As O
we O
were O
walking O
down O
the O
end O
of O
the O
wharf O
towards O
the O
ship O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
carrying O
his O
harpoon O
, O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR
in O
his O
gruff O
voice O
loudly O
hailed O
us O
from O
his O
wigwam O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
not O
suspected O
my O
friend O
was O
a O
cannibal O
, O
and O
furthermore O
announcing O
that O
he O
let O
no O
cannibals O
on O
board O
that O
craft O
, O
unless O
they O
previously O
produced O
their O
papers O
. O
“ O
What O

mean O
by O
that O
, O
Captain B-CHR

? O
” O
said O
I O
, O
now O
jumping O
on O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
leaving O
my O
comrade O
standing O
on O
the O
wharf O
. O
“ O
I O
mean O
, O
” O
he O
replied O
, O
“ O
he O
must O
show O
his O
papers O
. O
” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
” O
said O
Captain B-CHR
Bildad I-CHR
in O
his O
hollow O
voice O
, O
sticking O
his O
head O
from O
behind O
Peleg B-CHR
’ O
s O
, O
out O
of O

he O
added O
, O
turning O
to O

, O
“ O

putting O

, O
and O
leaning O
stiffly O
over O
the O

took O
a O
good O
long O

“ O

“ O

said O

” O

over O

got O
everything O

for O

turned O
to O

who O
had O
twice O

thrice O
before O

looked O
no O

abashed O
; O

taking O

copied O

of O

tattooed O

sat O
earnestly O

steadfastly O

at O

solemnly O

fumbling O
in O
the O

pockets O

took O
out O

, O
hear O
him O
now O
, O
” O
cried O
Peleg B-CHR
, O
marching O
across O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
thrusting O
his O
hands O
far O
down O
into O
his O
pockets O
, O
— O
“ O
hear O
him O
, O
all O
of O
ye O
. O
Think O
of O
that O
! O
When O
every O
moment O
we O
thought O
the O
ship O
would O
sink O
! O
Death O
and O
the O
Judgment O
then O
? O
What O
? O
With O
all O
three O
masts O
making O
such O
an O
everlasting O
thundering O
against O
the O
side O
; O
and O
every O
sea O
breaking O
over O
us O
, O
fore O
and O
aft O
. O
Think O
of O
Death O
and O
the O
Judgment O
then O
? O
No O
! O
no O
time O
to O
think O
about O
Death O
then O
. O
Life O
was O
what O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
and O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
; O
and O
how O
to O
save O
all O
hands—how O
to O
rig O
jury-masts—how O
to O
get O
into O
the O
nearest O
port O
; O
that O
was O
what O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
. O
” O
Bildad B-CHR
said O
no O
more O
, O
but O
buttoning O
up O
his O
coat O
, O
stalked O
on O
deck O
, O
where O
we O
followed O
him O
. O
There O
he O
stood O
, O
very O
quietly O
overlooking O
some O
sailmakers O
who O
were O
mending O
a O
top-sail O
in O
the O
waist O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
he O
stooped O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
patch O
, O
or O
save O
an O
end O
of O
tarred O
twine O
, O
which O
otherwise O
might O
have O
been O
wasted O
. O
