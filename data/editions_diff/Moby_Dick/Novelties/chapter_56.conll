In O
connexion O
with O
the O
monstrous O
pictures O
of O
whales O
, O
I O
am O
strongly O
tempted O
here O
to O
enter O
upon O
those O
still O
more O
monstrous O
stories O
of O
them O
which O
are O
to O
be O
found O
in O
certain O
books O
, O
both O
ancient O
and O
modern O

But O
I O
pass O
that O
matter O
by O
. O
I O
know O
of O
only O
four O
published O
outlines O
of O

great O
odds O

Beale B-CHR

is O
the O
best O
. O
All O
Beale B-CHR

drawings O
of O
this O
whale O
are O
good O
, O
excepting O
the O
middle O
figure O

the O
picture O
of O
three O
whales O

various O
attitudes O

though O
no O

calculated O
to O
excite O
the O
civil O
scepticism O
of O
some O
parlor O
men O
, O
is O
admirably O
correct O
and O
life-like O
in O
its O
general O
effect O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
drawings O
in O
J. B-CHR
Ross I-CHR

are O
pretty O
correct O
in O
contour O
; O
but O
they O
are O
wretchedly O
engraved O
. O
That O
is O
not O
his O
fault O
though O
. O
Of O
the O
Right O
Whale O
, O
the O
best O
outline O
pictures O
are O
in O
Scoresby B-CHR
; O
but O
they O
are O
drawn O
on O
too O
small O
a O
scale O
to O
convey O
a O
desirable O
impression O
. O
He O
has O
but O
one O
picture O
of O
whaling O
scenes O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
sad O
deficiency O
, O
because O
it O
is O
by O
such O
pictures O
only O
, O
when O
at O
all O
well O
done O
, O
that O
you O
can O
derive O
anything O
like O
a O
truthful O
idea O
of O
the O
living O
whale O
as O
seen O
by O
his O
living O
hunters O
. O
But O
, O
taken O
for O
all O
in O
all O
, O
by O
far O
the O
finest O
, O
though O
in O
some O
details O
not O
the O
most O
correct O
, O
presentations O
of O
whales O
and O
whaling O
scenes O
to O
be O
anywhere O
found O
, O
are O
two O
large O
French B-GRP
engravings O
, O
well O
executed O
, O
and O
taken O
from O
paintings O
by O
one O
Garnery B-CHR
. O
Respectively O
, O
they O
represent O
attacks O
on O
the O
Sperm O
and O
Right O
Whale O
. O
In O
the O
first O
engraving O
a O
noble O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
depicted O
in O
full O
majesty O
of O
might O
, O
just O
risen O
beneath O
the O
boat O
from O
the O
profundities O
of O
the O
ocean O
, O
and O
bearing O
high O
in O
the O
air O
upon O
his O
back O
the O
terrific O
wreck O
of O
the O
stoven O
planks O
. O
The O
prow O
of O
the O
boat O
is O
partially O
unbroken O
, O
and O
is O
drawn O
just O
balancing O
upon O
the O
monster O
’ O
s O
spine O
; O
and O
standing O
in O
that O
prow O
, O
for O
that O
one O
single O
incomputable O
flash O
of O
time O
, O
you O
behold O
an O
oarsman O
, O
half O
shrouded O
by O
the O
incensed O
boiling O
spout O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
and O
in O
the O
act O
of O
leaping O
, O
as O
if O
from O
a O
precipice O
. O
The O
action O
of O
the O
whole O
thing O
is O
wonderfully O
good O
and O
true O
. O
The O
half-emptied O
line-tub O
floats O
on O
the O
whitened O
sea O
; O
the O
wooden O
poles O
of O
the O
spilled O
harpoons O
obliquely O
bob O
in O
it O
; O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
swimming O
crew O
are O
scattered O
about O
the O
whale O
in O
contrasting O
expressions O
of O
affright O
; O
while O
in O
the O
black O
stormy O
distance O
the O
ship O
is O
bearing O
down O
upon O
the O
scene O
. O
Serious O
fault O
might O
be O
found O
with O
the O
anatomical O
details O
of O
this O
whale O
, O
but O
let O
that O
pass O
; O
since O
, O
for O
the O
life O
of O
me O
, O
I O
could O
not O
draw O
so O
good O
a O
one O
. O
In O
the O
second O
engraving O
, O
the O
boat O
is O
in O
the O
act O
of O
drawing O
alongside O
the O
barnacled O
flank O
of O
a O
large O
running O
Right O
Whale O
, O
that O
rolls O
his O
black O
weedy O
bulk O
in O
the O
sea O
like O
some O
mossy O
rock-slide O
from O
the O
Patagonian B-GRP
cliffs O
. O
His O
jets O
are O
erect O
, O
full O
, O
and O
black O
like O
soot O
; O
so O
that O
from O
so O
abounding O
a O
smoke O
in O
the O
chimney O
, O
you O
would O
think O
there O
must O
be O
a O
brave O
supper O
cooking O
in O
the O
great O
bowels O
below O
. O
Sea O
fowls O
are O
pecking O
at O
the O
small O
crabs O
, O
shell-fish O
, O
and O
other O
sea O
candies O
and O
maccaroni O
, O
which O
the O
Right O
Whale O
sometimes O
carries O
on O
his O
pestilent O
back O
. O
And O
all O
the O
while O
the O
thick-lipped O
leviathan O
is O
rushing O
through O
the O
deep O
, O
leaving O
tons O
of O
tumultuous O
white O
curds O
in O
his O
wake O
, O
and O
causing O
the O
slight O
boat O
to O
rock O
in O
the O
swells O
like O
a O
skiff O
caught O
nigh O
the O
paddle-wheels O
of O
an O
ocean O
steamer O
. O
Thus O
, O
the O
foreground O
is O
all O
raging O
commotion O
; O
but O
behind O
, O
in O
admirable O
artistic O
contrast O
, O
is O
the O
glassy O
level O
of O
a O
sea O
becalmed O
, O
the O
drooping O
unstarched O
sails O
of O
the O
powerless O
ship O
, O
and O
the O
inert O
mass O
of O
a O
dead O
whale O
, O
a O
conquered O
fortress O
, O
with O
the O
flag O
of O
capture O
lazily O
hanging O
from O
the O
whale-pole O
inserted O
into O
his O
spout-hole O
. O
Who O
Garnery B-CHR
the O
painter O
is O
, O
or O
was O
, O
I O
know O
not O
. O
But O
my O
life O
for O
it O
he O
was O
either O
practically O
conversant O
with O
his O
subject O
, O
or O
else O
marvellously O
tutored O
by O
some O
experienced O
whaleman O
. O
The O
French B-GRP
are O
the O
lads O
for O
painting O
action O
. O
Go O
and O
gaze O
upon O
all O
the O
paintings O
of O
Europe B-LOC
, O
and O
where O
will O
you O
find O
such O
a O
gallery O
of O
living O
and O
breathing O
commotion O
on O
canvas O
, O
as O
in O
that O
triumphal O
hall O
at O
Versailles B-LOC
; O
where O
the O
beholder O
fights O
his O
way O
, O
pell-mell O
, O
through O
the O
consecutive O
great O
battles O
of O
France B-LOC
; O
where O
every O
sword O
seems O
a O
flash O
of O
the O
Northern O
Lights O
, O
and O
the O
successive O
armed O
kings O
and O
Emperors O
dash O
by O
, O
like O
a O
charge O
of O
crowned O
centaurs O
? O
Not O
wholly O
unworthy O
of O
a O
place O
in O
that O
gallery O
, O
are O
these O
sea O
battle-pieces O
of O
Garnery B-CHR
. O
The O
natural O
aptitude O
of O
the O
French B-GRP
for O
seizing O
the O
picturesqueness O
of O
things O
seems O
to O
be O
peculiarly O
evinced O
in O
what O
paintings O
and O
engravings O
they O
have O
of O
their O
whaling O
scenes O
. O
With O

conveying O
the O
real O
spirit O
of O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
the O
English B-GRP
and O
American B-GRP
whale O
draughtsmen O
seem O
entirely O
content O
with O
presenting O
the O
mechanical O
outline O
of O
things O
, O
such O
as O
the O
vacant O
profile O
of O
the O
whale O
; O
which O
, O
so O
far O
as O
picturesqueness O
of O
effect O
is O
concerned O
, O
is O
about O
tantamount O
to O
sketching O
the O
profile O
of O
a O
pyramid O
. O
Even O
Scoresby B-CHR
, O
the O
justly O
renowned O

of O

ninety-six O

the O
excellent O

, O
but O
in O
so O
important O
a O
matter O

an O
oversight O

fine O

two O
other O
French B-GRP
engravings O
worthy O
of O
note O
, O
by O
some O
one O
who O
subscribes O
himself O
“ O
H. B-CHR

” O
One O
of O
them O
, O
though O
not O
precisely O
adapted O
to O
our O
present O
purpose O
, O
nevertheless O
deserves O
mention O
on O
other O
accounts O
. O
It O
is O
a O
quiet O
noon-scene O
among O
the O
isles O
of O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
; O
a O
French B-GRP
whaler O
anchored O
, O
inshore O
, O
in O
a O
calm O
, O
and O
lazily O
taking O
water O
on O
board O
; O
the O
loosened O
sails O
of O
the O
ship O

the O
long O
leaves O
of O
the O
palms O
in O
the O
background O
, O
both O
drooping O
together O
in O
the O
breezeless O
air O
. O
The O
effect O
is O
very O
fine O
, O
when O
considered O
with O
reference O
to O
its O
presenting O
the O
hardy O
fishermen O
under O
one O
of O
their O
few O
aspects O
of O
oriental O
repose O
. O
The O
other O
engraving O
is O
quite O
a O
different O
affair O
: O
the O
ship O
hove-to O
upon O
the O
open O
sea O
, O
and O
in O
the O
very O
heart O
of O
the O
Leviathanic O
life O

the O
act O

hove O
over O

hurriedly O
pushing O
off O

about O

the O

its O

while O
from O
a O
sudden O
roll O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
little O
craft O
stands O
half-erect O
out O

going O
up O

rising O
up O
