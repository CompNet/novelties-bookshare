In O
this O
same O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
there O
stands O
a O
Whaleman B-LOC
’ I-LOC
s I-LOC
Chapel I-LOC
, O
and O
few O
are O
the O
moody O
fishermen O
, O
shortly O
bound O
for O
the O
Indian B-LOC
Ocean I-LOC
or O
Pacific B-LOC
, O
who O
fail O
to O
make O
a O
Sunday O
visit O
to O
the O
spot O
. O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
I O
did O
not O
. O
Returning O
from O
my O
first O
morning O
stroll O
, O
I O
again O
sallied O
out O
upon O
this O
special O
errand O
. O
The O
sky O
had O
changed O
from O
clear O
, O
sunny O
cold O
, O
to O
driving O
sleet O
and O
mist O
. O
Wrapping O
myself O
in O
my O
shaggy O
jacket O
of O
the O
cloth O
called O
bearskin O
, O
I O
fought O
my O
way O
against O
the O
stubborn O
storm O
. O
Entering O
, O
I O
found O
a O
small O
scattered O
congregation O
of O
sailors O
, O
and O
sailors O
’ O
wives O
and O
widows O
. O
A O
muffled O
silence O
reigned O
, O
only O
broken O
at O
times O
by O
the O
shrieks O
of O
the O
storm O
. O
Each O
silent O
worshipper O
seemed O
purposely O
sitting O
apart O
from O
the O
other O
, O
as O
if O
each O
silent O
grief O
were O
insular O
and O
incommunicable O
. O
The O
chaplain O
had O
not O
yet O
arrived O
; O
and O
there O
these O
silent O
islands O
of O
men O
and O
women O
sat O
steadfastly O
eyeing O
several O
marble O
tablets O
, O
with O
black O
borders O
, O
masoned O
into O
the O
wall O
on O
either O
side O
the O
pulpit O
. O
Three O
of O
them O
ran O
something O
like O
the O
following O
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
pretend O
to O
quote O

THIS O
TABLET O
Is O
erected O
to O
his O
Memory O
BY O
HIS O
WIDOW O
. O
Shaking O
off O
the O
sleet O
from O
my O
ice-glazed O
hat O
and O
jacket O
, O
I O
seated O
myself O
near O
the O
door O
, O
and O
turning O
sideways O
was O
surprised O
to O
see O
Queequeg B-CHR
near O
me O
. O
Affected O
by O
the O
solemnity O
of O
the O
scene O
, O
there O
was O
a O
wondering O
gaze O
of O
incredulous O
curiosity O
in O
his O
countenance O
. O
This O
savage O
was O
the O
only O
person O
present O
who O
seemed O
to O
notice O
my O
entrance O
; O
because O
he O
was O
the O
only O
one O
who O
could O
not O
read O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
was O
not O
reading O
those O
frigid O
inscriptions O
on O
the O
wall O
. O
Whether O
any O
of O
the O
relatives O
of O
the O
seamen O
whose O
names O
appeared O
there O
were O
now O
among O
the O
congregation O
, O
I O
knew O
not O
; O
but O
so O
many O
are O
the O
unrecorded O
accidents O
in O
the O
fishery O
, O
and O
so O
plainly O
did O
several O
women O
present O
wear O
the O
countenance O
if O
not O
the O
trappings O
of O
some O
unceasing O
grief O
, O
that O
I O
feel O
sure O
that O
here O
before O
me O
were O
assembled O
those O
, O
in O
whose O
unhealing O
hearts O
the O
sight O
of O
those O
bleak O
tablets O
sympathetically O
caused O
the O
old O
wounds O
to O
bleed O
afresh O
. O
Oh O
! O
ye O
whose O
dead O
lie O
buried O
beneath O
the O
green O
grass O
; O
who O
standing O
among O
flowers O
can O
say—here O
, O
_here_ O
lies O
my O
beloved O
; O
ye O
know O
not O
the O
desolation O
that O
broods O
in O
bosoms O
like O
these O
. O
What O
bitter O
blanks O
in O
those O
black-bordered O
marbles O
which O
cover O
no O
ashes O
! O
What O
despair O
in O
those O
immovable O
inscriptions O
! O
What O
deadly O
voids O
and O
unbidden O
infidelities O
in O
the O
lines O
that O
seem O
to O
gnaw O
upon O
all O
Faith O
, O
and O
refuse O
resurrections O
to O
the O
beings O
who O
have O
placelessly O
perished O
without O
a O
grave O
. O
As O
well O
might O
those O
tablets O
stand O
in O
the O
cave O
of O
Elephanta B-LOC
as O
here O
. O
In O
what O
census O
of O
living O
creatures O
, O
the O
dead O
of O
mankind O
are O
included O
; O
why O
it O
is O
that O
a O
universal O
proverb O
says O
of O
them O
, O
that O
they O
tell O
no O
tales O
, O
though O
containing O
more O
secrets O
than O
the O
Goodwin B-LOC
Sands I-LOC
; O
how O
it O
is O
that O
to O
his O
name O
who O
yesterday O
departed O
for O
the O
other O
world O
, O
we O
prefix O
so O
significant O
and O
infidel O
a O
word O
, O
and O
yet O
do O
not O
thus O
entitle O
him O
, O
if O
he O
but O
embarks O
for O
the O
remotest O
Indies B-LOC
of O
this O
living O
earth O
; O
why O
the O
Life O
Insurance O
Companies O
pay O
death-forfeitures O
upon O
immortals O
; O
in O
what O
eternal O
, O
unstirring O
paralysis O
, O
and O
deadly O
, O
hopeless O
trance O
, O
yet O
lies O
antique O
Adam B-CHR
who O
died O
sixty O
round O
centuries O
ago O
; O
how O
it O
is O
that O
we O
still O
refuse O
to O
be O
comforted O
for O
those O
who O
we O
nevertheless O
maintain O
are O
dwelling O
in O
unspeakable O
bliss O
; O
why O
all O
the O
living O
so O
strive O
to O
hush O
all O
the O
dead O
; O
wherefore O
but O
the O
rumor O
of O
a O
knocking O
in O
a O
tomb O
will O
terrify O
a O
whole O
city O
. O
All O
these O
things O
are O
not O
without O
their O
meanings O
. O
But O
Faith O
, O
like O
a O
jackal O
, O
feeds O
among O
the O
tombs O
, O
and O
even O
from O
these O
dead O
doubts O
she O
gathers O
her O
most O
vital O
hope O
. O
It O
needs O
scarcely O
to O
be O
told O
, O
with O
what O
feelings O
, O
on O
the O
eve O
of O
a O
Nantucket B-LOC
voyage O
, O
I O
regarded O
those O
marble O
tablets O
, O
and O
by O
the O
murky O
light O
of O
that O
darkened O
, O
doleful O
day O
read O
the O
fate O
of O
the O
whalemen O
who O
had O
gone O
before O
me O
. O
Yes O
, O
Ishmael B-CHR
, O
the O
same O
fate O
may O
be O
thine O
. O
But O
somehow O
I O
grew O
merry O
again O
. O
Delightful O
inducements O
to O
embark O
, O
fine O
chance O
for O
promotion O
, O
it O
seems—aye O
, O
a O
stove O
boat O
will O
make O
me O
an O
immortal O
by O
brevet O
. O
Yes O
, O
there O
is O
death O
in O
this O
business O
of O
whaling—a O
speechlessly O
quick O
chaotic O
bundling O
of O
a O
man O
into O
Eternity O
. O
But O
what O
then O
? O
Methinks O
we O
have O
hugely O
mistaken O
this O
matter O
of O
Life O
and O
Death O
. O
Methinks O
that O
what O
they O
call O
my O
shadow O
here O
on O
earth O
is O
my O
true O
substance O
. O
Methinks O
that O
in O
looking O
at O
things O
spiritual O
, O
we O
are O
too O
much O
like O
oysters O
observing O
the O
sun O
through O
the O
water O
, O
and O
thinking O
that O
thick O
water O
the O
thinnest O
of O
air O
. O
Methinks O
my O
body O
is O
but O
the O
lees O
of O
my O
better O
being O
. O
In O
fact O
take O
my O
body O
who O
will O
, O
take O
it O
I O
say O
, O
it O
is O
not O
me O
. O
And O
therefore O
three O
cheers O
for O
Nantucket B-LOC
; O
and O
come O
a O
stove O
boat O
and O
stove O
body O
when O
they O
will O
, O
for O
stave O
my O
soul O
, O
Jove B-CHR
himself O
can O
not O
. O
