Slowly O
wading O
through O
the O
meadows O
of O
brit O
, O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
still O
held O
on O
her O
way O
north-eastward O
towards O
the O
island O
of O
Java B-LOC
; O
a O
gentle O
air O
impelling O
her O
keel O
, O
so O
that O
in O
the O
surrounding O
serenity O
her O
three O
tall O
tapering O
masts O
mildly O
waved O
to O
that O
languid O
breeze O
, O
as O
three O
mild O
palms O
on O
a O
plain O
. O
And O
still O
, O
at O
wide O
intervals O
in O
the O
silvery O
night O
, O
the O
lonely O
, O
alluring O
jet O
would O
be O
seen O
. O
But O
one O
transparent O
blue O
morning O
, O
when O
a O
stillness O
almost O
preternatural O
spread O
over O
the O
sea O
, O
however O
unattended O
with O
any O
stagnant O
calm O
; O
when O
the O
long O
burnished O
sun-glade O
on O
the O
waters O
seemed O
a O
golden O
finger O
laid O
across O
them O
, O
enjoining O
some O
secrecy O
; O
when O
the O
slippered O
waves O
whispered O
together O
as O
they O
softly O
ran O
on O
; O
in O
this O
profound O
hush O
of O
the O
visible O
sphere O
a O
strange O
spectre O
was O
seen O
by O
Daggoo B-CHR
from O
the O
main-mast-head O
. O
In O
the O
distance O
, O
a O
great O
white O
mass O
lazily O
rose O
, O
and O
rising O
higher O
and O
higher O
, O
and O
disentangling O
itself O
from O
the O
azure O
, O
at O
last O
gleamed O
before O
our O
prow O
like O
a O
snow-slide O
, O
new O
slid O
from O
the O
hills O
. O
Thus O
glistening O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
as O
slowly O
it O
subsided O
, O
and O
sank O
. O
Then O
once O
more O
arose O
, O
and O
silently O
gleamed O
. O
It O
seemed O
not O
a O
whale O
; O
and O
yet O
is O
this O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
? O
thought O
Daggoo B-CHR
. O
Again O
the O
phantom O
went O
down O
, O
but O
on O
re-appearing O
once O
more O
, O
with O
a O
stiletto-like O
cry O
that O
startled O
every O
man O
from O
his O
nod O
, O
the O
negro O
yelled O
out— O
“ O
There O
! O
there O
again O
! O
there O
she O
breaches O
! O
right O
ahead O
! O
The O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
, O
the O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
! O
” O
Upon O
this O
, O
the O
seamen O
rushed O
to O
the O
yard-arms O
, O
as O
in O
swarming-time O
the O
bees O
rush O
to O
the O
boughs O
. O
Bare-headed O
in O
the O
sultry O
sun O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
stood O
on O
the O
bowsprit O
, O
and O
with O
one O
hand O
pushed O
far O
behind O
in O
readiness O
to O
wave O
his O
orders O
to O
the O
helmsman O
, O
cast O
his O
eager O
glance O
in O
the O
direction O
indicated O
aloft O
by O
the O
outstretched O
motionless O
arm O
of O
Daggoo B-CHR
. O
Whether O
the O
flitting O
attendance O
of O
the O
one O
still O
and O
solitary O
jet O
had O
gradually O
worked O
upon O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
so O
that O
he O
was O
now O
prepared O
to O
connect O
the O
ideas O
of O
mildness O
and O
repose O
with O
the O
first O
sight O
of O
the O
particular O
whale O
he O
pursued O
; O
however O
this O
was O
, O
or O
whether O
his O
eagerness O
betrayed O
him O
; O
whichever O
way O
it O
might O
have O
been O
, O
no O
sooner O
did O
he O
distinctly O
perceive O
the O
white O
mass O
, O
than O
with O
a O
quick O
intensity O
he O
instantly O
gave O
orders O
for O
lowering O
. O
The O
four O
boats O
were O
soon O
on O
the O
water O
; O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
in O
advance O
, O
and O
all O
swiftly O
pulling O
towards O
their O
prey O
. O
Soon O
it O
went O
down O
, O
and O
while O
, O
with O
oars O
suspended O
, O
we O
were O
awaiting O
its O
reappearance O
, O
lo O
! O
in O
the O
same O
spot O
where O
it O
sank O
, O
once O
more O
it O
slowly O
rose O
. O
Almost O
forgetting O
for O
the O
moment O
all O
thoughts O
of O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
, O
we O
now O
gazed O
at O
the O
most O
wondrous O
phenomenon O
which O
the O
secret O
seas O
have O
hitherto O
revealed O
to O
mankind O
. O
A O
vast O
pulpy O
mass O
, O
furlongs O
in O
length O
and O
breadth O
, O
of O
a O
glancing O
cream-colour O
, O
lay O
floating O
on O
the O
water O
, O
innumerable O
long O
arms O
radiating O
from O
its O
centre O
, O
and O
curling O
and O
twisting O
like O
a O
nest O
of O
anacondas O
, O
as O
if O
blindly O
to O
clutch O
at O
any O
hapless O
object O
within O
reach O
. O
No O
perceptible O
face O
or O
front O
did O
it O
have O
; O
no O
conceivable O
token O
of O
either O
sensation O
or O
instinct O
; O
but O
undulated O
there O
on O
the O
billows O
, O
an O
unearthly O
, O
formless O
, O
chance-like O
apparition O
of O
life O
. O
As O
with O
a O
low O
sucking O
sound O
it O
slowly O
disappeared O
again O
, O
Starbuck B-CHR
still O
gazing O
at O
the O
agitated O
waters O
where O
it O
had O
sunk O
, O
with O
a O
wild O
voice O
exclaimed— O
“ O
Almost O
rather O
had O
I O
seen O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
and O
fought O
him O
, O
than O
to O
have O
seen O
thee O
, O
thou O
white O
ghost O
! O
” O
“ O
What O
was O
it O
, O
Sir O
? O
” O
said O
Flask B-CHR
. O
“ O
The O
great O
live O
squid O
, O
which O
, O
they O
say O
, O
few O
whale-ships O
ever O
beheld O
, O
and O
returned O
to O
their O
ports O
to O
tell O
of O
it O
. O
” O
But O
Ahab B-CHR
said O
nothing O
; O
turning O
his O
boat O
, O
he O
sailed O
back O
to O
the O
vessel O
; O
the O
rest O
as O
silently O
following O
. O
Whatever O
superstitions O
the O
sperm O
whalemen O
in O
general O
have O
connected O
with O
the O
sight O
of O
this O
object O
, O
certain O
it O
is O
, O
that O
a O
glimpse O
of O
it O
being O
so O
very O
unusual O
, O
that O
circumstance O
has O
gone O
far O
to O
invest O
it O
with O
portentousness O
. O
So O
rarely O
is O
it O
beheld O
, O
that O
though O
one O
and O
all O
of O
them O
declare O
it O
to O
be O
the O
largest O
animated O
thing O
in O
the O
ocean O
, O
yet O
very O
few O
of O
them O
have O
any O
but O
the O
most O
vague O
ideas O
concerning O
its O
true O
nature O
and O
form O
; O
notwithstanding O
, O
they O
believe O
it O
to O
furnish O
to O
the O
sperm O
whale O
his O
only O
food O
. O
For O
though O
other O
species O
of O
whales O
find O
their O
food O
above O
water O
, O
and O
may O
be O
seen O
by O
man O
in O
the O
act O
of O
feeding O
, O
the O
spermaceti O
whale O
obtains O
his O
whole O
food O
in O
unknown O
zones O
below O
the O
surface O
; O
and O
only O
by O
inference O
is O
it O
that O
any O
one O
can O
tell O
of O
what O
, O
precisely O
, O
that O
food O
consists O
. O
At O
times O
, O
when O
closely O
pursued O
, O
he O
will O
disgorge O
what O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
detached O
arms O
of O
the O
squid O
; O
some O
of O
them O
thus O
exhibited O
exceeding O
twenty O
and O
thirty O
feet O
in O
length O
. O
They O
fancy O
that O
the O
monster O
to O
which O
these O
arms O
belonged O
ordinarily O
clings O
by O
them O
to O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
ocean O
; O
and O
that O
the O
sperm O
whale O
, O
unlike O
other O
species O
, O
is O
supplied O
with O
teeth O
in O
order O
to O
attack O
and O
tear O
it O
. O
There O
seems O
some O
ground O
to O
imagine O
that O
the O
great O
Kraken B-CHR
of O
Bishop B-CHR
Pontoppodan I-CHR
may O
ultimately O
resolve O
itself O
into O
Squid O
. O
The O
manner O
in O
which O
the O
Bishop O
describes O
it O
, O
as O
alternately O
rising O
and O
sinking O
, O
with O
some O
other O
particulars O
he O
narrates O
, O
in O
all O
this O
the O
two O
correspond O
. O
But O
much O
abatement O
is O
necessary O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
incredible O
bulk O
he O
assigns O
it O
. O
By O
some O
naturalists O
who O
have O
vaguely O
heard O
rumors O
of O
the O
mysterious O
creature O
, O
here O
spoken O
of O
, O
it O
is O
included O
among O
the O
class O
of O
cuttle-fish O
, O
to O
which O
, O
indeed O
, O
in O
certain O
external O
respects O
it O
would O
seem O
to O
belong O
, O
but O
only O
as O
the O
Anak B-CHR
of O
the O
tribe O
. O
