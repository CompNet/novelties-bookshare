Next O
morning O
the O
not-yet-subsided O
sea O
rolled O
in O
long O
slow O
billows O
of O
mighty O
bulk O
, O
and O
striving O
in O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
gurgling O
track O
, O
pushed O
her O
on O
like O
giants O
’ O
palms O
outspread O
. O
The O
strong O
, O
unstaggering O
breeze O
abounded O
so O
, O
that O
sky O
and O
air O
seemed O
vast O
outbellying O
sails O
; O
the O
whole O
world O
boomed O
before O
the O
wind O
. O
Muffled O
in O
the O
full O
morning O
light O
, O
the O
invisible O
sun O
was O
only O
known O
by O
the O
spread O
intensity O
of O
his O
place O
; O
where O
his O
bayonet O
rays O
moved O
on O
in O
stacks O
. O
Emblazonings O
, O
as O
of O
crowned O
Babylonian B-GRP
kings O
and O
queens O
, O
reigned O
over O
everything O
. O
The O
sea O
was O
as O
a O
crucible O
of O
molten O
gold O
, O
that O
bubblingly O
leaps O
with O
light O
and O
heat O
. O
Long O
maintaining O
an O
enchanted O
silence O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
stood O
apart O
; O
and O
every O
time O
the O
tetering O
ship O
loweringly O
pitched O
down O
her O
bowsprit O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
eye O
the O
bright O
sun O
’ O
s O
rays O
produced O
ahead O
; O
and O
when O
she O
profoundly O
settled O
by O
the O
stern O
, O
he O
turned O
behind O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
sun O
’ O
s O
rearward O
place O
, O
and O
how O
the O
same O
yellow O
rays O
were O
blending O
with O
his O
undeviating O
wake O
. O
“ O
Ha O
, O
ha O
, O
my O
ship O
! O
thou O
mightest O
well O
be O
taken O
now O
for O
the O
sea-chariot O
of O
the O
sun O
. O
Ho O
, O
ho O
! O
all O
ye O
nations O
before O
my O
prow O
, O
I O
bring O
the O
sun O
to O
ye O
! O
Yoke O
on O
the O
further O
billows O
; O
hallo O
! O
a O
tandem O
, O
I O
drive O
the O
sea O
! O
” O
But O
suddenly O
reined O
back O
by O
some O
counter O
thought O
, O
he O
hurried O
towards O
the O
helm O
, O
huskily O
demanding O
how O
the O
ship O
was O
heading O
. O
“ O
East-sou-east O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
said O
the O
frightened O
steersman O
. O
“ O
Thou O
liest O
! O
” O
smiting O
him O
with O
his O
clenched O
fist O
. O
“ O
Heading O
East O
at O
this O
hour O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
astern O
? O
” O
Upon O
this O
every O
soul O
was O
confounded O
; O
for O
the O
phenomenon O
just O
then O
observed O
by O
Ahab B-CHR
had O
unaccountably O
escaped O
every O
one O
else O
; O
but O
its O
very O
blinding O
palpableness O
must O
have O
been O
the O
cause O
. O
Thrusting O
his O
head O
half O
way O
into O
the O
binnacle O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
caught O
one O
glimpse O
of O
the O
compasses O
; O
his O
uplifted O
arm O
slowly O
fell O
; O
for O
a O
moment O
he O
almost O
seemed O
to O
stagger O
. O
Standing O
behind O
him O
Starbuck B-CHR
looked O
, O
and O
lo O
! O
the O
two O
compasses O
pointed O
East O
, O
and O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
as O
infallibly O
going O
West O
. O
But O
ere O
the O
first O
wild O
alarm O
could O
get O
out O
abroad O
among O
the O
crew O
, O
the O
old O
man O
with O
a O
rigid O
laugh O
exclaimed O
, O
“ O
I O
have O
it O
! O
It O
has O
happened O
before O
. O
Mr. B-CHR
Starbuck I-CHR
, O
last O
night O
’ O
s O
thunder O
turned O
our O
compasses—that O
’ O
s O
all O
. O
Thou O
hast O
before O
now O
heard O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
, O
I O
take O
it O
. O
” O
“ O
Aye O
; O
but O
never O
before O
has O
it O
happened O
to O
me O
, O
sir O
, O
” O
said O
the O
pale O
mate O
, O
gloomily O
. O
Here O
, O
it O
must O
needs O
be O
said O
, O
that O
accidents O
like O
this O
have O
in O
more O
than O
one O
case O
occurred O
to O
ships O
in O
violent O
storms O
. O
The O
magnetic O
energy O
, O
as O
developed O
in O
the O
mariner O
’ O
s O
needle O
, O
is O
, O
as O
all O
know O
, O
essentially O
one O
with O
the O
electricity O
beheld O
in O
heaven B-LOC
; O
hence O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
much O
marvelled O
at O
, O
that O
such O
things O
should O
be O
. O
Instances O
where O
the O
lightning O
has O
actually O
struck O
the O
vessel O
, O
so O
as O
to O
smite O
down O
some O
of O
the O
spars O
and O
rigging O
, O
the O
effect O
upon O
the O
needle O
has O
at O
times O
been O
still O
more O
fatal O
; O
all O
its O
loadstone O
virtue O
being O
annihilated O
, O
so O
that O
the O
before O
magnetic O
steel O
was O
of O
no O
more O
use O
than O
an O
old O
wife O
’ O
s O
knitting O
needle O
. O
But O
in O
either O
case O
, O
the O
needle O
never O
again O
, O
of O
itself O
, O
recovers O
the O
original O
virtue O
thus O
marred O
or O
lost O
; O
and O
if O
the O
binnacle O
compasses O
be O
affected O
, O
the O
same O
fate O
reaches O
all O
the O
others O
that O
may O
be O
in O
the O
ship O
; O
even O
were O
the O
lowermost O
one O
inserted O
into O
the O
kelson O
. O
Deliberately O
standing O
before O
the O
binnacle O
, O
and O
eyeing O
the O
transpointed O
compasses O
, O
the O
old O
man O
, O
with O
the O
sharp O
of O
his O
extended O
hand O
, O
now O
took O
the O
precise O
bearing O
of O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
satisfied O
that O
the O
needles O
were O
exactly O
inverted O
, O
shouted O
out O
his O
orders O
for O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
course O
to O
be O
changed O
accordingly O
. O
The O
yards O
were O
hard O
up O
; O
and O
once O
more O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
thrust O
her O
undaunted O
bows O
into O
the O
opposing O
wind O
, O
for O
the O
supposed O
fair O
one O
had O
only O
been O
juggling O
her O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
whatever O
were O
his O
own O
secret O
thoughts O
, O
Starbuck B-CHR
said O
nothing O
, O
but O
quietly O
he O
issued O
all O
requisite O
orders O
; O
while O
Stubb B-CHR
and O
Flask B-CHR
— O
who O
in O
some O
small O
degree O
seemed O
then O
to O
be O
sharing O
his O
feelings—likewise O
unmurmuringly O
acquiesced O
. O
As O
for O
the O
men O
, O
though O
some O
of O
them O
lowly O
rumbled O
, O
their O
fear O
of O
Ahab B-CHR
was O
greater O
than O
their O
fear O
of O
Fate O
. O
But O
as O
ever O
before O
, O
the O
pagan O
harpooneers O
remained O
almost O
wholly O
unimpressed O
; O
or O
if O
impressed O
, O
it O
was O
only O
with O
a O
certain O
magnetism O
shot O
into O
their O
congenial O
hearts O
from O
inflexible O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
. O
For O
a O
space O
the O
old O
man O
walked O
the O
deck O
in O
rolling O
reveries O
. O
But O
chancing O
to O
slip O
with O
his O
ivory O
heel O
, O
he O
saw O
the O
crushed O
copper O
sight-tubes O
of O
the O
quadrant O
he O
had O
the O
day O
before O
dashed O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
“ O
Thou O
poor O
, O
proud O
heaven-gazer O
and O
sun O
’ O
s O
pilot O
! O
yesterday O
I O
wrecked O
thee O
, O
and O
to-day O
the O
compasses O
would O
fain O
have O
wrecked O
me O
. O
So O
, O
so O
. O
But O
Ahab B-CHR
is O
lord O
over O
the O
level O
loadstone O
yet O
. O
Mr. B-CHR
Starbuck I-CHR
— O
a O
lance O
without O
a O
pole O
; O
a O
top-maul O
, O
and O
the O
smallest O
of O
the O
sail-maker O
’ O
s O
needles O

Quick O
! O
” O
Accessory O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
the O
impulse O
dictating O
the O
thing O
he O
was O
now O
about O
to O
do O
, O
were O
certain O
prudential O
motives O
, O
whose O
object O
might O
have O
been O
to O
revive O
the O
spirits O
of O
his O
crew O
by O
a O
stroke O
of O
his O
subtile O
skill O
, O
in O
a O
matter O
so O
wondrous O
as O
that O
of O
the O
inverted O
compasses O
. O
Besides O
, O
the O
old O
man O
well O
knew O
that O
to O
steer O
by O
transpointed O
needles O
, O
though O
clumsily O
practicable O
, O
was O
not O
a O
thing O
to O
be O
passed O
over O
by O
superstitious O
sailors O
, O
without O
some O
shudderings O
and O
evil O
portents O
. O
“ O
Men O
, O
” O
said O
he O
, O
steadily O
turning O
upon O
the O
crew O
, O
as O
the O
mate O
handed O
him O
the O
things O
he O
had O
demanded O
, O
“ O
my O
men O
, O
the O
thunder O
turned O
old O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
needles O
; O
but O
out O
of O
this O
bit O
of O
steel O
Ahab B-CHR
can O
make O
one O
of O
his O
own O
, O
that O
will O
point O
as O
true O
as O
any O
. O
” O
Abashed O
glances O
of O
servile O
wonder O
were O
exchanged O
by O
the O
sailors O
, O
as O
this O
was O
said O
; O
and O
with O
fascinated O
eyes O
they O
awaited O
whatever O
magic O
might O
follow O
. O
But O
Starbuck B-CHR
looked O
away O
. O
With O
a O
blow O
from O
the O
top-maul O
Ahab B-CHR
knocked O
off O
the O
steel O
head O
of O
the O
lance O
, O
and O
then O
handing O
to O
the O
mate O
the O
long O
iron O
rod O
remaining O
, O
bade O
him O
hold O
it O
upright O
, O
without O
its O
touching O
the O
deck O
. O
Then O
, O
with O
the O
maul O
, O
after O
repeatedly O
smiting O
the O
upper O
end O
of O
this O
iron O
rod O
, O
he O
placed O
the O
blunted O
needle O
endwise O
on O
the O
top O
of O
it O
, O
and O
less O
strongly O
hammered O
that O
, O
several O
times O
, O
the O
mate O
still O
holding O
the O
rod O
as O
before O
. O
Then O
going O
through O
some O
small O
strange O
motions O
with O
it—whether O
indispensable O
to O
the O
magnetizing O
of O
the O
steel O
, O
or O
merely O
intended O
to O
augment O
the O
awe O
of O
the O
crew O
, O
is O
uncertain—he O
called O
for O
linen O
thread O
; O
and O
moving O
to O
the O
binnacle O
, O
slipped O
out O
the O
two O
reversed O
needles O
there O
, O
and O
horizontally O
suspended O
the O
sail-needle O
by O
its O
middle O
, O
over O
one O
of O
the O
compass-cards O
. O
At O
first O
, O
the O
steel O
went O
round O
and O
round O
, O
quivering O
and O
vibrating O
at O
either O
end O
; O
but O
at O
last O
it O
settled O
to O
its O
place O
, O
when O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
who O
had O
been O
intently O
watching O
for O
this O
result O
, O
stepped O
frankly O
back O
from O
the O
binnacle O
, O
and O
pointing O
his O
stretched O
arm O
towards O
it O
, O
exclaimed O
, O
— O
“ O
Look O
ye O
, O
for O
yourselves O
, O
if O
Ahab B-CHR
be O
not O
lord O
of O
the O
level O
loadstone O
! O
The O
sun O
is O
East O
, O
and O
that O
compass O
swears O
it O
! O
” O
One O
after O
another O
they O
peered O
in O
, O
for O
nothing O
but O
their O
own O
eyes O
could O
persuade O
such O
ignorance O
as O
theirs O
, O
and O
one O
after O
another O
they O
slunk O
away O
. O
In O
his O
fiery O
eyes O
of O
scorn O
and O
triumph O
, O
you O
then O
saw O
Ahab B-CHR
in O
all O
his O
fatal O
pride O
. O
