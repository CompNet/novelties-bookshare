Concerning O
the O
officers O
of O
the O
whale-craft O
, O
this O
seems O
as O
good O
a O
place O
as O
any O
to O
set O
down O
a O
little O
domestic O
peculiarity O
on O
ship-board O
, O
arising O
from O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
harpooneer O
class O
of O
officers O
, O
a O
class O
unknown O
of O
course O
in O
any O
other O
marine O
than O
the O
whale-fleet O
. O
The O
large O
importance O
attached O
to O
the O
harpooneer O
’ O
s O
vocation O
is O
evinced O
by O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
originally O
in O
the O
old O
Dutch B-GRP
Fishery O
, O
two O
centuries O
and O
more O
ago O
, O
the O
command O
of O
a O
whale O
ship O
was O
not O
wholly O
lodged O
in O
the O
person O
now O
called O
the O
captain O
, O
but O
was O
divided O
between O
him O
and O
an O
officer O
called O
the O
Specksnyder O
. O
Literally O
this O
word O
means O
Fat-Cutter O
; O
usage O
, O
however O
, O
in O
time O
made O
it O
equivalent O
to O
Chief O
Harpooneer O
. O
In O
those O
days O
, O
the O
captain O
’ O
s O
authority O
was O
restricted O
to O
the O
navigation O
and O
general O
management O
of O
the O
vessel O
; O
while O
over O
the O
whale-hunting O
department O
and O
all O
its O
concerns O
, O
the O
Specksnyder O
or O
Chief O
Harpooneer O
reigned O
supreme O
. O
In O
the O
British B-GRP
Greenland B-LOC
Fishery O
, O
under O
the O
corrupted O
title O
of O
Specksioneer O
, O
this O
old O
Dutch B-GRP
official O
is O
still O
retained O
, O
but O
his O
former O
dignity O
is O
sadly O
abridged O
. O
At O
present O
he O
ranks O
simply O
as O
senior O
Harpooneer O
; O
and O
as O
such O
, O
is O
but O
one O
of O
the O
captain O
’ O
s O
more O
inferior O
subalterns O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
as O
upon O
the O
good O
conduct O
of O
the O
harpooneers O
the O
success O
of O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
largely O
depends O
, O
and O
since O
in O
the O
American B-GRP
Fishery O
he O
is O
not O
only O
an O
important O
officer O
in O
the O
boat O
, O
but O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
( O
night O
watches O
on O
a O
whaling O
ground O
) O
the O
command O
of O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
deck O
is O
also O
his O
; O
therefore O
the O
grand O
political O
maxim O
of O
the O
sea O
demands O
, O
that O
he O
should O
nominally O
live O
apart O
from O
the O
men O
before O
the O
mast O
, O
and O
be O
in O
some O
way O
distinguished O
as O
their O
professional O
superior O
; O
though O
always O
, O
by O
them O
, O
familiarly O
regarded O
as O
their O
social O
equal O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
grand O
distinction O
drawn O
between O
officer O
and O
man O
at O
sea O
, O
is O
this—the O
first O
lives O
aft O
, O
the O
last O
forward O
. O
Hence O
, O
in O
whale-ships O
and O
merchantmen O
alike O
, O
the O
mates O
have O
their O
quarters O
with O
the O
captain O
; O
and O
so O
, O
too O
, O
in O
most O
of O
the O
American B-GRP
whalers O
the O
harpooneers O
are O
lodged O
in O
the O
after O
part O
of O
the O
ship O
. O
That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
they O
take O
their O
meals O
in O
the O
captain O
’ O
s O
cabin O
, O
and O
sleep O
in O
a O
place O
indirectly O
communicating O
with O
it O
. O
Though O
the O
long O
period O
of O
a O
Southern O
whaling O
voyage O
( O
by O
far O
the O
longest O
of O
all O
voyages O
now O
or O
ever O
made O
by O
man O
) O
, O
the O
peculiar O
perils O
of O
it O
, O
and O
the O
community O
of O
interest O
prevailing O
among O
a O
company O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
, O
high O
or O
low O
, O
depend O
for O
their O
profits O
, O
not O
upon O
fixed O
wages O
, O
but O
upon O
their O
common O
luck O
, O
together O
with O
their O
common O
vigilance O
, O
intrepidity O
, O
and O
hard O
work O
; O
though O
all O
these O
things O
do O
in O
some O
cases O
tend O
to O
beget O
a O
less O
rigorous O
discipline O
than O
in O
merchantmen O
generally O
; O
yet O
, O
never O
mind O
how O
much O
like O
an O
old O
Mesopotamian B-GRP
family O
these O
whalemen O
may O
, O
in O
some O
primitive O
instances O
, O
live O
together O
; O
for O
all O
that O
, O
the O
punctilious O
externals O
, O
at O
least O
, O
of O
the O
quarter-deck O
are O
seldom O
materially O
relaxed O
, O
and O
in O
no O
instance O
done O
away O
. O
Indeed O
, O
many O
are O
the O
Nantucket B-LOC
ships O
in O
which O
you O
will O
see O
the O
skipper O
parading O
his O
quarter-deck O
with O
an O
elated O
grandeur O
not O
surpassed O
in O
any O
military O
navy O
; O
nay O
, O
extorting O
almost O
as O
much O
outward O
homage O
as O
if O
he O
wore O
the O
imperial O
purple O
, O
and O
not O
the O
shabbiest O
of O
pilot-cloth O
. O
And O
though O
of O
all O
men O
the O
moody O
captain O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
the O
least O
given O
to O
that O
sort O
of O
shallowest O
assumption O
; O
and O
though O
the O
only O
homage O
he O
ever O
exacted O
, O
was O
implicit O
, O
instantaneous O
obedience O
; O
though O
he O
required O
no O
man O
to O
remove O
the O
shoes O
from O
his O
feet O
ere O
stepping O
upon O
the O
quarter-deck O
; O
and O
though O
there O
were O
times O
when O
, O
owing O
to O
peculiar O
circumstances O
connected O
with O
events O
hereafter O
to O
be O
detailed O
, O
he O
addressed O
them O
in O
unusual O
terms O
, O
whether O
of O
condescension O
or O
_in O
terrorem_ O
, O
or O
otherwise O
; O
yet O
even O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
was O
by O
no O
means O
unobservant O
of O
the O
paramount O
forms O
and O
usages O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
Nor O
, O
perhaps O
, O
will O
it O
fail O
to O
be O
eventually O
perceived O
, O
that O
behind O
those O
forms O
and O
usages O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
he O
sometimes O
masked O
himself O
; O
incidentally O
making O
use O
of O
them O
for O
other O
and O
more O
private O
ends O
than O
they O
were O
legitimately O
intended O
to O
subserve O
. O
That O
certain O
sultanism O
of O
his O
brain O
, O
which O
had O
otherwise O
in O
a O
good O
degree O
remained O
unmanifested O
; O
through O
those O
forms O
that O
same O
sultanism O
became O
incarnate O
in O
an O
irresistible O
dictatorship O
. O
For O
be O
a O
man O
’ O
s O
intellectual O
superiority O
what O
it O
will O
, O
it O
can O
never O
assume O
the O
practical O
, O
available O
supremacy O
over O
other O
men O
, O
without O
the O
aid O
of O
some O
sort O
of O
external O
arts O
and O
entrenchments O
, O
always O
, O
in O
themselves O
, O
more O
or O
less O
paltry O
and O
base O
. O
This O
it O
is O
, O
that O
for O
ever O
keeps O
God B-CHR
’ O
s O
true O
princes O
of O
the O
Empire O
from O
the O
world O
’ O
s O
hustings O
; O
and O
leaves O
the O
highest O
honors O
that O
this O
air O
can O
give O
, O
to O
those O
men O
who O
become O
famous O
more O
through O
their O
infinite O
inferiority O
to O
the O
choice O
hidden O
handful O
of O
the O
Divine B-GRP
Inert I-GRP
, O
than O
through O
their O
undoubted O
superiority O
over O
the O
dead O
level O
of O
the O
mass O
. O
Such O
large O
virtue O
lurks O
in O
these O
small O
things O
when O
extreme O
political O
superstitions O
invest O
them O
, O
that O
in O
some O
royal O
instances O
even O
to O
idiot O
imbecility O
they O
have O
imparted O
potency O
. O
But O
when O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
Nicholas B-CHR
the I-CHR
Czar I-CHR
, O
the O
ringed O
crown O
of O
geographical O
empire O
encircles O
an O
imperial O
brain O
; O
then O
, O
the O
plebeian O
herds O
crouch O
abased O
before O
the O
tremendous O
centralization O
. O
Nor O
, O
will O
the O
tragic O
dramatist O
who O
would O
depict O
mortal O
indomitableness O
in O
its O
fullest O
sweep O
and O
direct O
swing O
, O
ever O
forget O
a O
hint O
, O
incidentally O
so O
important O
in O
his O
art O
, O
as O
the O
one O
now O
alluded O
to O
. O
But O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
my O
Captain O
, O
still O
moves O
before O
me O
in O
all O
his O
Nantucket B-LOC
grimness O
and O
shagginess O
; O
and O
in O
this O
episode O
touching O
Emperors O
and O
Kings O
, O
I O
must O
not O
conceal O
that O
I O
have O
only O
to O
do O
with O
a O
poor O
old O
whale-hunter O
like O
him O
; O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
all O
outward O
majestical O
trappings O
and O
housings O
are O
denied O
me O
. O
Oh O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
! O
what O
shall O
be O
grand O
in O
thee O
, O
it O
must O
needs O
be O
plucked O
at O
from O
the O
skies O
, O
and O
dived O
for O
in O
the O
deep O

featured O

the O
unbodied O
air O
