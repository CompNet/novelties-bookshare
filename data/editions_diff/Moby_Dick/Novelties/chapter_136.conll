Why O

tossed O
from O
out O
of O
the O

So O
, O
floating O
on O
the O
margin O
of O
the O
ensuing O
scene O
, O
and O
in O
full O
sight O
of O
it O
, O
when O
the O
halfspent O
suction O

I O
was O
then O
, O
but O
slowly O
, O
drawn O
towards O
the O
closing O

When O
I O
reached O
it O
, O
it O
had O
subsided O
to O
a O
creamy O
pool O
. O
Round O
and O
round O
, O
then O
, O
and O
ever O
contracting O
towards O
the O
button-like O
black O
bubble O
at O
the O
axis O
of O
that O
slowly O
wheeling O
circle O

like O
another O

Till O
, O
gaining O

black O
bubble O
upward O
burst O
; O
and O
now O
, O
liberated O
by O
reason O
of O
its O
cunning O
spring O
, O
and O

its O
great O
buoyancy O

shot O
lengthwise O
from O
the O
sea O

for O
almost O
one O
whole O

dirgelike O
main O

On O
the O
second O

a O
sail O
drew O
near O
