In O
bed O
we O
concocted O
our O
plans O
for O
the O
morrow O
. O
But O
to O
my O
surprise O
and O
no O
small O
concern O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
now O
gave O
me O
to O
understand O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
diligently O
consulting O
Yojo B-CHR
— O
the O
name O
of O
his O
black O
little O
god—and O
Yojo B-CHR
had O
told O
him O
two O
or O
three O
times O
over O
, O
and O
strongly O
insisted O
upon O
it O
everyway O
, O
that O
instead O
of O
our O
going O
together O
among O
the O
whaling-fleet O
in O
harbor O
, O
and O
in O
concert O
selecting O
our O
craft O
; O
instead O
of O
this O
, O
I O
say O
, O
Yojo B-CHR
earnestly O
enjoined O
that O
the O
selection O
of O
the O
ship O
should O
rest O
wholly O
with O
me O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
Yojo B-CHR
purposed O
befriending O
us O
; O
and O
, O
in O
order O
to O
do O
so O
, O
had O
already O
pitched O
upon O
a O
vessel O
, O
which O
, O
if O
left O
to O
myself O
, O
I O
, O
Ishmael B-CHR
, O
should O
infallibly O
light O
upon O
, O
for O
all O
the O
world O
as O
though O
it O
had O
turned O
out O
by O
chance O
; O
and O
in O
that O
vessel O
I O
must O
immediately O
ship O
myself O
, O
for O
the O
present O
irrespective O
of O
Queequeg B-CHR
. O
I O
have O
forgotten O
to O
mention O
that O
, O
in O
many O
things O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
placed O
great O
confidence O
in O
the O
excellence O
of O
Yojo B-CHR
’ O
s O
judgment O
and O
surprising O
forecast O
of O
things O
; O
and O
cherished O
Yojo B-CHR
with O
considerable O
esteem O
, O
as O
a O
rather O
good O
sort O
of O
god O
, O
who O
perhaps O
meant O
well O
enough O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
but O
in O
all O
cases O
did O
not O
succeed O
in O
his O
benevolent O
designs O
. O
Now O
, O
this O
plan O
of O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O
s O
, O
or O
rather O
Yojo B-CHR
’ O
s O
, O
touching O
the O
selection O
of O
our O
craft O
; O
I O
did O
not O
like O
that O
plan O
at O
all O
. O
I O
had O
not O
a O
little O
relied O
upon O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O
s O
sagacity O
to O
point O
out O
the O
whaler O
best O
fitted O
to O
carry O
us O
and O
our O
fortunes O
securely O
. O
But O
as O
all O
my O
remonstrances O
produced O
no O
effect O
upon O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
I O
was O
obliged O
to O
acquiesce O
; O
and O
accordingly O
prepared O
to O
set O
about O
this O
business O
with O
a O
determined O
rushing O
sort O
of O
energy O
and O
vigor O
, O
that O
should O
quickly O
settle O
that O
trifling O
little O
affair O
. O
Next O
morning O
early O
, O
leaving O
Queequeg B-CHR
shut O
up O
with O
Yojo B-CHR
in O
our O
little O
bedroom—for O
it O
seemed O
that O
it O
was O
some O
sort O
of O
Lent B-MSC
or O
Ramadan B-MSC
, O
or O
day O
of O
fasting O
, O
humiliation O
, O
and O
prayer O
with O
Queequeg B-CHR
and O
Yojo B-CHR
that O
day O
; O
_how_ O
it O
was O
I O
never O
could O
find O
out O
, O
for O
, O
though O
I O
applied O
myself O
to O
it O
several O
times O
, O
I O
never O
could O
master O
his O
liturgies O
and O
XXXIX O
Articles—leaving O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
then O
, O
fasting O
on O
his O
tomahawk O
pipe O
, O
and O
Yojo B-CHR
warming O
himself O
at O
his O
sacrificial O
fire O
of O
shavings O
, O
I O
sallied O
out O
among O
the O
shipping O
. O
After O
much O
prolonged O
sauntering O
and O
many O
random O
inquiries O
, O
I O
learnt O
that O
there O
were O
three O
ships O
up O
for O
three-years O
’ O
voyages—The O
Devil-dam B-MSC
, O
the O
Tit-bit B-MSC
, O
and O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
. O
_ O
Devil-Dam B-MSC
_ O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
origin O
of O
; O
_ O
Tit-bit B-MSC
_ O
is O
obvious O
; O
_ O
Pequod B-MSC
_ O
, O
you O
will O
no O
doubt O
remember O
, O
was O
the O
name O
of O
a O
celebrated O
tribe O
of O
Massachusetts B-GRP
Indians I-GRP
; O
now O
extinct O
as O
the O
ancient O
Medes B-GRP
. O
I O
peered O
and O
pryed O
about O
the O
Devil-dam B-MSC
; O
from O
her O
, O
hopped O
over O
to O
the O
Tit-bit B-MSC
; O
and O
finally O
, O
going O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
looked O
around O
her O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
decided O
that O
this O
was O
the O
very O
ship O
for O
us O
. O
You O
may O
have O
seen O
many O
a O
quaint O
craft O
in O
your O
day O
, O
for O
aught O
I O
know O
; O
—square-toed O
luggers O
; O
mountainous O
Japanese B-GRP
junks O
; O
butter-box O
galliots O
, O
and O
what O
not O
; O
but O
take O
my O
word O
for O
it O
, O
you O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
rare O
old O
craft O
as O
this O
same O
rare O
old O
Pequod B-MSC
. O
She O
was O
a O
ship O
of O
the O
old O
school O
, O
rather O
small O
if O
anything O
; O
with O
an O
old-fashioned O
claw-footed O
look O
about O
her O
. O
Long O
seasoned O
and O
weather-stained O
in O
the O
typhoons O
and O
calms O
of O
all O
four O
oceans O
, O
her O
old O
hull O
’ O
s O
complexion O
was O
darkened O
like O
a O
French B-GRP
grenadier O
’ O
s O
, O
who O
has O
alike O
fought O
in O
Egypt B-LOC
and O
Siberia B-LOC
. O
Her O
venerable O
bows O
looked O
bearded O
. O
Her O
masts—cut O
somewhere O
on O
the O
coast O
of O
Japan B-LOC
, O
where O
her O
original O
ones O
were O
lost O
overboard O
in O
a O
gale—her O
masts O
stood O
stiffly O
up O
like O
the O
spines O
of O
the O
three O
old O
kings O
of O
Cologne B-LOC
. O
Her O
ancient O
decks O
were O
worn O
and O
wrinkled O
, O
like O
the O
pilgrim-worshipped O
flag-stone O
in O
Canterbury B-LOC
Cathedral I-LOC
where O
Becket B-CHR
bled O
. O
But O
to O
all O
these O
her O
old O
antiquities O
, O
were O
added O
new O
and O
marvellous O
features O
, O
pertaining O
to O
the O
wild O
business O
that O
for O
more O
than O
half O
a O
century O
she O
had O
followed O
. O
Old O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR
, O
many O
years O
her O
chief-mate O
, O
before O
he O
commanded O
another O
vessel O
of O
his O
own O
, O
and O
now O
a O
retired O
seaman O
, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
principal O
owners O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
—this O
old O
Peleg B-CHR
, O
during O
the O
term O
of O
his O
chief-mateship O
, O
had O
built O
upon O
her O
original O
grotesqueness O
, O
and O
inlaid O
it O
, O
all O
over O
, O
with O
a O
quaintness O
both O
of O
material O
and O
device O
, O
unmatched O
by O
anything O
except O
it O
be O
Thorkill-Hake B-CHR
’ O
s O
carved O
buckler O
or O
bedstead O
. O
She O
was O
apparelled O
like O
any O
barbaric O
Ethiopian B-GRP
emperor O
, O
his O
neck O
heavy O
with O
pendants O
of O
polished O
ivory O
. O
She O
was O
a O
thing O
of O
trophies O
. O
A O
cannibal O
of O
a O
craft O
, O
tricking O
herself O
forth O
in O
the O
chased O
bones O
of O
her O
enemies O
. O
All O
round O
, O
her O
unpanelled O
, O
open O
bulwarks O
were O
garnished O
like O
one O
continuous O
jaw O
, O
with O
the O
long O
sharp O
teeth O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
, O
inserted O
there O
for O
pins O
, O
to O
fasten O
her O
old O
hempen O
thews O
and O
tendons O
to O
. O
Those O
thews O
ran O
not O
through O
base O
blocks O
of O
land O
wood O
, O
but O
deftly O
travelled O
over O
sheaves O
of O
sea-ivory O
. O
Scorning O
a O
turnstile O
wheel O
at O
her O
reverend O
helm O
, O
she O
sported O
there O
a O
tiller O
; O
and O
that O
tiller O
was O
in O
one O
mass O
, O
curiously O
carved O
from O
the O
long O
narrow O
lower O
jaw O
of O
her O
hereditary O
foe O
. O
The O
helmsman O
who O
steered O
by O
that O
tiller O
in O
a O
tempest O
, O
felt O
like O
the O
Tartar B-GRP
, O
when O
he O
holds O
back O
his O
fiery O
steed O
by O
clutching O
its O
jaw O
. O
A O
noble O
craft O
, O
but O
somehow O
a O
most O
melancholy O
! O
All O
noble O
things O
are O
touched O
with O
that O
. O
Now O
when O
I O
looked O
about O
the O
quarter-deck O
, O
for O
some O
one O
having O
authority O
, O
in O
order O
to O
propose O
myself O
as O
a O
candidate O
for O
the O
voyage O
, O
at O
first O
I O
saw O
nobody O
; O
but O
I O
could O
not O
well O
overlook O
a O
strange O
sort O
of O
tent O
, O
or O
rather O
wigwam O
, O
pitched O
a O
little O
behind O
the O
main-mast O
. O
It O
seemed O
only O
a O
temporary O
erection O
used O
in O
port O
. O
It O
was O
of O
a O
conical O
shape O
, O
some O
ten O
feet O
high O
; O
consisting O
of O
the O
long O
, O
huge O
slabs O
of O
limber O
black O
bone O
taken O
from O
the O
middle O
and O
highest O
part O
of O
the O
jaws O
of O
the O
right-whale O
. O
Planted O
with O
their O
broad O
ends O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
a O
circle O
of O
these O
slabs O
laced O
together O
, O
mutually O
sloped O
towards O
each O
other O
, O
and O
at O
the O
apex O
united O
in O
a O
tufted O
point O
, O
where O
the O
loose O
hairy O
fibres O
waved O
to O
and O
fro O
like O
the O
top-knot O
on O
some O
old O
Pottowottamie B-CHR
Sachem I-CHR
’ O
s O
head O
. O
A O
triangular O
opening O
faced O
towards O
the O
bows O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
so O
that O
the O
insider O
commanded O
a O
complete O
view O
forward O
. O
And O
half O
concealed O
in O
this O
queer O
tenement O
, O
I O
at O
length O
found O
one O
who O
by O
his O
aspect O
seemed O
to O
have O
authority O
; O
and O
who O
, O
it O
being O
noon O
, O
and O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
work O
suspended O
, O
was O
now O
enjoying O
respite O
from O
the O
burden O
of O
command O
. O
He O
was O
seated O
on O
an O
old-fashioned O
oaken O
chair O
, O
wriggling O
all O
over O
with O
curious O
carving O
; O
and O
the O
bottom O
of O
which O
was O
formed O
of O
a O
stout O
interlacing O
of O
the O
same O
elastic O
stuff O
of O
which O
the O
wigwam O
was O
constructed O
. O
There O
was O
nothing O
so O
very O
particular O
, O
perhaps O
, O
about O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
elderly O
man O
I O
saw O
; O
he O
was O
brown O
and O
brawny O
, O
like O
most O
old O
seamen O
, O
and O
heavily O
rolled O
up O
in O
blue O
pilot-cloth O
, O
cut O
in O
the O
Quaker B-GRP
style O
; O
only O
there O
was O
a O
fine O
and O
almost O
microscopic O
net-work O
of O
the O
minutest O
wrinkles O
interlacing O
round O
his O
eyes O
, O
which O
must O
have O
arisen O
from O
his O
continual O
sailings O
in O
many O
hard O
gales O
, O
and O
always O
looking O
to O
windward O
; O
—for O
this O
causes O
the O
muscles O
about O
the O
eyes O
to O
become O
pursed O
together O
. O
Such O
eye-wrinkles O
are O
very O
effectual O
in O
a O
scowl O
. O
“ O
Is O
this O
the O
Captain O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
? O
” O
said O
I O
, O
advancing O
to O
the O
door O
of O
the O
tent O
. O
“ O
Supposing O
it O
be O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
what O
dost O
thou O
want O
of O
him O
? O
” O
he O
demanded O
. O
“ O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
shipping O
. O
” O
“ O
Thou O
wast O
, O
wast O
thou O
? O
I O
see O
thou O
art O
no O
Nantucketer B-GRP
— O
ever O
been O
in O
a O
stove O
boat O
? O
” O
“ O
No O
, O
Sir O
, O
I O
never O
have O
. O
” O
“ O
Dost O
know O
nothing O
at O
all O
about O
whaling O
, O
I O
dare O
say—eh O
? O
“ O
Nothing O
, O
Sir O
; O
but O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
I O
shall O
soon O
learn O
. O
I O
’ O
ve O
been O
several O
voyages O
in O
the O
merchant O
service O
, O
and O
I O
think O
that— O
” O
“ O

damned O

Talk O
not O
that O
lingo O

me O

Dost O

that O
leg O

—I O

take O
that O

away O

puzzled O

not O

exactly O
how O
to O

it O

But O
concentrating O
all O
his O
crow O
’ O

feet O
into O
one O
scowl O
, O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR
started O
me O
on O
the O
errand O
. O
Going O
forward O
and O
glancing O
over O
the O
weather O
bow O

I O
perceived O
that O
the O
ship O
swinging O
to O
her O
anchor O
with O
the O
flood-tide O
, O
was O
now O
obliquely O
pointing O
towards O
the O
open O
ocean O
. O
The O
prospect O
was O
unlimited O
, O
but O
exceedingly O
monotonous O
and O
forbidding O
; O
not O
the O
slightest O
variety O
that O
I O
could O
see O
. O
“ O
Well O
, O
what O
’ O
s O
the O
report O
? O
” O
said O
Peleg B-CHR
when O
I O
came O
back O
; O
“ O
what O
did O
ye O
see O
? O
” O
“ O
Not O
much O
, O
” O
I O
replied— O
“ O
nothing O
but O
water O
; O
considerable O
horizon O
though O
, O
and O
there O
’ O
s O
a O
squall O
coming O
up O

I O

” O
“ O

ye O

’ O

ye O

” O
I O
was O
a O
little O
staggered O
, O
but O
go O
a-whaling O
I O
must O
, O
and O
I O
would O
; O
and O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
as O
good O
a O
ship O
as O
any—I O
thought O
the O
best—and O
all O
this O
I O
now O
repeated O
to O
Peleg B-CHR
. O
Seeing O
me O
so O
determined O
, O
he O
expressed O
his O
willingness O
to O
ship O
me O
. O
“ O
And O
thou O
mayest O
as O
well O
sign O
the O
papers O
right O
off O
, O
” O
he O
added— O
“ O
come O
along O
with O
ye. O
” O
And O
so O
saying O
, O
he O
led O
the O
way O
below O
deck O
into O
the O
cabin O
. O
Seated O
on O
the O
transom O
was O
what O
seemed O
to O
me O
a O
most O
uncommon O
and O
surprising O
figure O
. O
It O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
Captain B-CHR
Bildad I-CHR
, O
who O
along O
with O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR
was O
one O
of O
the O
largest O
owners O
of O
the O
vessel O
; O
the O
other O
shares O
, O
as O
is O
sometimes O
the O
case O
in O
these O
ports O
, O
being O
held O
by O
a O
crowd O
of O
old O
annuitants O
; O
widows O
, O
fatherless O
children O
, O
and O
chancery O
wards O

owning O
about O

value O
of O
a O
timber O
head O

a O
foot O
of O
plank O
, O
or O
a O
nail O
or O
two O
in O
the O
ship O

People O
in O
Nantucket B-LOC
invest O
their O
money O
in O
whaling O
vessels O

the O

way O
that O
you O
do O
yours O
in O
approved O
state O
stocks O
bringing O
in O
good O
interest O

Now O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
like O
Peleg B-CHR
, O
and O
indeed O
many O
other O
Nantucketers B-GRP

was O
a O
Quaker B-GRP
, O
the O
island O
having O
been O
originally O
settled O
by O
that O
sect O
; O
and O
to O
this O
day O
its O
inhabitants O
in O
general O
retain O
in O
an O
uncommon O
measure O
the O
peculiarities O
of O
the O
Quaker B-GRP
, O
only O
variously O
and O
anomalously O
modified O
by O
things O
altogether O
alien O
and O
heterogeneous O
. O
For O
some O
of O
these O
same O
Quakers B-GRP
are O
the O
most O
sanguinary O
of O
all O
sailors O
and O
whale-hunters O
. O
They O
are O
fighting O
Quakers B-GRP
; O
they O
are O
Quakers B-GRP
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O
So O
that O
there O
are O
instances O
among O
them O
of O
men O
, O
who O
, O
named O
with O
Scripture B-MSC
names—a O
singularly O
common O
fashion O
on O
the O

in O

the O
stately O

thee O

of O

from O
the O
audacious O

daring O

and O
boundless O
adventure O
of O
their O
subsequent O
lives O
, O
strangely O
blend O
with O
these O
unoutgrown O
peculiarities O
, O
a O
thousand O
bold O
dashes O
of O
character O
, O
not O
unworthy O
a O
Scandinavian B-GRP
sea-king O
, O
or O
a O
poetical O
Pagan B-GRP
Roman B-GRP
. O
And O
when O
these O
things O
unite O
in O
a O
man O
of O
greatly O
superior O
natural O
force O
, O
with O
a O
globular O
brain O

ponderous O

with O
some O
help O
from O

to O
learn O
a O
bold O

mighty O
pageant O

formed O

Nor O
will O
it O
at O
all O
detract O
from O
him O

half O
wilful O

For O
all O

with O
such O
an O

with O
quite O
another O

still O

who O
, O
if O
indeed O
peculiar O

again O
from O
another O

Still O
, O
for O
all O

there O
some O

the O
contemplative O
evening O
of O

the O

reconciled O
these O
things O
in O
the O
reminiscence O

I O
do O
not O

; O
but O
it O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
concern O
him O
much O
, O
and O
very O
probably O
he O
had O
long O
since O
come O
to O
the O
sage O
and O
sensible O
conclusion O
that O
a O
man O

is O
one O
thing O
, O
and O
this O

Rising O
from O
a O
little O
cabin-boy O
in O
short O
clothes O
of O
the O
drabbest O
drab O
, O
to O
a O
harpooneer O

from O
that O
becoming O

captain O
, O
and O
finally O
a O
ship O
owner O
; O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
as O
I O
hinted O
before O
, O
had O
concluded O
his O
adventurous O
career O
by O
wholly O
retiring O
from O
active O
life O
at O
the O
goodly O
age O
of O
sixty O
, O
and O
dedicating O
his O
remaining O
days O
to O
the O
quiet O
receiving O
of O
his O
well-earned O
income O
. O
Now O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
say O
, O
had O
the O
reputation O
of O
being O
an O
incorrigible O
old O
hunks O
, O
and O
in O
his O
sea-going O
days O
, O
a O
bitter O
, O
hard O
task-master O
. O
They O
told O
me O
in O
Nantucket B-LOC
, O
though O
it O
certainly O
seems O
a O
curious O
story O
, O
that O
when O
he O
sailed O
the O
old O
Categut B-GRP
whaleman O
, O
his O
crew O
, O
upon O
arriving O
home O
, O
were O
mostly O
all O
carried O
ashore O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
sore O
exhausted O
and O
worn O
out O
. O
For O
a O
pious O
man O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
Quaker B-GRP
, O
he O
was O
certainly O
rather O
hard-hearted O
, O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O
He O
never O
used O
to O
swear O
, O
though O
, O
at O
his O
men O
, O
they O
said O
; O
but O
somehow O
he O
got O
an O
inordinate O
quantity O
of O
cruel O
, O
unmitigated O
hard O
work O
out O
of O
them O
. O
When O
Bildad B-CHR
was O
a O
chief-mate O
, O
to O
have O
his O
drab-coloured O
eye O
intently O
looking O
at O
you O
, O
made O
you O
feel O
completely O
nervous O
, O
till O
you O
could O
clutch O
something—a O
hammer O
or O
a O
marling-spike O
, O
and O
go O
to O
work O
like O
mad O
, O
at O
something O
or O
other O
, O
never O
mind O
what O
. O
Indolence O
and O
idleness O
perished O
before O
him O
. O
His O
own O
person O
was O
the O
exact O
embodiment O
of O
his O
utilitarian O
character O
. O
On O
his O
long O
, O
gaunt O
body O
, O
he O
carried O
no O
spare O
flesh O
, O
no O
superfluous O
beard O
, O
his O
chin O
having O
a O
soft O
, O
economical O
nap O
to O
it O
, O
like O
the O
worn O
nap O
of O
his O
broad-brimmed O
hat O
. O
Such O
, O
then O
, O
was O
the O
person O
that O
I O
saw O
seated O
on O
the O
transom O
when O
I O
followed O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR
down O
into O
the O
cabin O
. O
The O
space O
between O
the O
decks O
was O
small O
; O
and O
there O
, O
bolt-upright O
, O
sat O
old O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
who O
always O
sat O
so O
, O
and O
never O
leaned O
, O
and O
this O
to O
save O
his O
coat O
tails O
. O
His O
broad-brim O
was O
placed O
beside O
him O
; O
his O
legs O
were O
stiffly O
crossed O
; O
his O
drab O
vesture O
was O
buttoned O
up O
to O
his O
chin O
; O
and O
spectacles O
on O
nose O
, O
he O
seemed O
absorbed O
in O
reading O
from O
a O
ponderous O
volume O
. O
“ O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
” O
cried O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR
, O
“ O
at O
it O
again O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
eh O
? O
Ye O
have O
been O
studying O
those O
Scriptures B-MSC
, O
now O
, O
for O
the O
last O
thirty O
years O
, O
to O
my O
certain O
knowledge O
. O
How O
far O
ye O
got O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
? O
” O
As O
if O
long O
habituated O
to O
such O
profane O
talk O
from O
his O
old O
shipmate O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
without O
noticing O
his O
present O
irreverence O
, O
quietly O
looked O
up O
, O
and O
seeing O
me O
, O
glanced O
again O
inquiringly O
towards O
Peleg B-CHR
. O
“ O
He O
says O
he O
’ O
s O
our O
man O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
” O
said O
Peleg B-CHR
, O
“ O
he O
wants O
to O
ship O
. O
” O
“ O
Dost O
thee O
? O
” O
said O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
in O
a O
hollow O
tone O
, O
and O
turning O
round O
to O
me O
. O
“ O
I O
_dost_ O
, O
” O
said O
I O
unconsciously O
, O
he O
was O
so O
intense O
a O
Quaker B-GRP
. O
“ O
What O
do O
ye O
think O
of O
him O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
? O
” O
said O
Peleg B-CHR
. O
“ O
He O
’ O
ll O
do O
, O
” O
said O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
eyeing O
me O
, O
and O
then O
went O
on O
spelling O
away O
at O
his O
book O
in O
a O
mumbling O
tone O
quite O
audible O
. O
I O
thought O
him O
the O
queerest O
old O
Quaker B-GRP
I O
ever O
saw O
, O
especially O
as O
Peleg B-CHR
, O
his O
friend O
and O
old O
shipmate O
, O
seemed O
such O
a O
blusterer O
. O
But O
I O
said O
nothing O
, O
only O
looking O
round O
me O
sharply O
. O
Peleg B-CHR
now O
threw O
open O
a O
chest O
, O
and O
drawing O
forth O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
articles O
, O
placed O
pen O
and O
ink O
before O
him O
, O
and O
seated O
himself O
at O
a O
little O
table O
. O
I O
began O
to O
think O
it O
was O
high O
time O
to O
settle O
with O
myself O
at O
what O
terms O
I O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
engage O
for O
the O
voyage O
. O
I O
was O
already O
aware O
that O
in O
the O
whaling O
business O
they O
paid O
no O
wages O
; O
but O
all O
hands O
, O
including O
the O
captain O
, O
received O
certain O
shares O
of O
the O
profits O
called O
_lays_ O
, O
and O
that O
these O
lays O
were O
proportioned O
to O
the O
degree O
of O
importance O
pertaining O
to O
the O
respective O
duties O
of O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
company O
. O
I O
was O
also O
aware O
that O
being O
a O
green O
hand O
at O
whaling O
, O
my O
own O
lay O
would O
not O
be O
very O
large O
; O
but O
considering O
that O
I O
was O
used O
to O
the O
sea O
, O
could O
steer O
a O
ship O
, O
splice O
a O
rope O
, O
and O
all O
that O
, O
I O
made O
no O
doubt O
that O
from O
all O
I O
had O
heard O
I O
should O
be O
offered O
at O
least O
the O
275th O
lay—that O
is O
, O
the O
275th O
part O
of O
the O
clear O
net O
proceeds O
of O
the O
voyage O
, O
whatever O
that O
might O
eventually O
amount O
to O
. O
And O
though O
the O
275th O
lay O
was O
what O
they O
call O
a O
rather O
_long O
lay_ O
, O
yet O
it O
was O
better O
than O
nothing O
; O
and O
if O
we O
had O
a O
lucky O
voyage O
, O
might O
pretty O
nearly O
pay O
for O
the O
clothing O
I O
would O
wear O
out O
on O
it O
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
my O
three O
years O
’ O
beef O
and O
board O
, O
for O
which O
I O
would O
not O
have O
to O
pay O
one O
stiver O
. O
It O
might O
be O
thought O
that O
this O
was O
a O
poor O
way O
to O
accumulate O
a O
princely O
fortune—and O
so O
it O
was O
, O
a O
very O
poor O
way O
indeed O
. O
But O
I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
that O
never O
take O
on O
about O
princely O
fortunes O
, O
and O
am O
quite O
content O
if O
the O
world O
is O
ready O
to O
board O
and O
lodge O
me O
, O
while O
I O
am O
putting O
up O
at O
this O
grim O
sign O
of O
the O
Thunder O
Cloud O
. O
Upon O
the O
whole O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
275th O
lay O
would O
be O
about O
the O
fair O
thing O
, O
but O
would O
not O
have O
been O
surprised O
had O
I O
been O
offered O
the O
200th O
, O
considering O
I O
was O
of O
a O
broad-shouldered O
make O
. O
But O
one O
thing O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
that O
made O
me O
a O
little O
distrustful O
about O
receiving O
a O
generous O
share O
of O
the O
profits O
was O
this O
: O
Ashore O
, O
I O
had O
heard O
something O
of O
both O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR
and O
his O
unaccountable O
old O
crony O
Bildad B-CHR
; O
how O
that O
they O
being O
the O
principal O
proprietors O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
therefore O
the O
other O
and O
more O
inconsiderable O
and O
scattered O
owners O
, O
left O
nearly O
the O
whole O
management O
of O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
affairs O
to O
these O
two O
. O
And O
I O
did O
not O
know O
but O
what O
the O
stingy O
old O
Bildad B-CHR
might O
have O
a O
mighty O
deal O
to O
say O
about O
shipping O
hands O
, O
especially O
as O
I O
now O
found O
him O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
quite O
at O
home O
there O
in O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
reading O
his O
Bible B-MSC
as O
if O
at O
his O
own O
fireside O
. O
Now O
while O
Peleg B-CHR
was O
vainly O
trying O
to O
mend O
a O
pen O
with O
his O
jack-knife O
, O
old O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
to O
my O
no O
small O
surprise O
, O
considering O
that O
he O
was O
such O
an O
interested O
party O
in O
these O
proceedings O
; O
Bildad B-CHR
never O
heeded O
us O
, O
but O
went O
on O
mumbling O
to O
himself O
out O
of O
his O
book O
, O
“ O
_Lay_ O
not O
up O
for O
yourselves O
treasures O
upon O
earth O
, O
where O
moth— O
” O
“ O
Well O
, O
Captain B-CHR
Bildad I-CHR
, O
” O
interrupted O
Peleg B-CHR
, O
“ O
what O
d O
’ O
ye O
say O
, O
what O
lay O
shall O
we O
give O
this O
young O
man O
? O
” O
“ O
Thou O
knowest O
best O
, O
” O
was O
the O
sepulchral O
reply O
, O
“ O
the O
seven O
hundred O

seventy-seventh O
wouldn O

” O
_Lay_ O

indeed O

thought O
I O
, O
and O
such O
a O
lay O
! O
the O
seven O
hundred O

seventy-seventh O
! O
Well O
, O
old O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
you O
are O
determined O
that O
I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
shall O
not O
_lay_ O
up O
many O
_lays_ O
here O
below O
, O
where O
moth O
and O
rust O
do O
corrupt O
. O
It O
was O
an O
exceedingly O
_long O
lay_ O
that O
, O
indeed O
; O
and O
though O
from O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
figure O
it O
might O
at O
first O
deceive O
a O
landsman O
, O
yet O
the O
slightest O
consideration O
will O
show O
that O
though O
seven O
hundred O
and O
seventy-seven O
is O
a O
pretty O
large O
number O
, O
yet O
, O
when O
you O
come O
to O
make O
a O
_teenth_ O
of O
it O
, O
you O
will O
then O
see O
, O
I O
say O

that O
the O
seven O

I O
thought O
at O
the O
time O

“ O

your O
eyes O

cried O
Peleg B-CHR
, O
“ O
thou O

not O

“ O
Seven O

again O
said O
Bildad B-CHR
, O
without O
lifting O
his O
eyes O
; O
and O
then O
went O
on O
mumbling— O
“ O

” O
Bildad B-CHR
laid O
down O
his O
book O
, O
and O
turning O
solemnly O
towards O
him O
said O
, O
“ O
Captain B-CHR

starting O
up O

clattering O
about O
the O

“ O

” O
As O
he O
thundered O
out O
this O
he O
made O
a O
rush O
at O

with O
a O
marvellous O
oblique O
, O
sliding O
celerity O
, O
Bildad B-CHR
for O
that O

up O
all O

a O
vessel O
so O
questionably O
owned O

I O
stepped O
aside O
from O

egress O

no O

all O
eagerness O

vanish O
from O
before O
the O
awakened O
wrath O
of O
Peleg B-CHR

But O
to O
my O
astonishment O
, O
he O
sat O
down O
again O
on O
the O
transom O
very O
quietly O
, O
and O
seemed O
to O
have O
not O
the O
slightest O
intention O

withdrawing O

He O
seemed O
quite O
used O

impenitent O

his O
ways O

As O
for O
Peleg B-CHR

off O
his O
rage O

sat O
down O

glancing O
up O
from O
the O
book O
in O

he O
had O
again O

burying O
himself O

“ O
Oh O

“ O

” O
“ O

” O
And O
, O
after O
signing O
the O
papers O
, O
off O
I O
went O
; O
nothing O
doubting O
but O
that O
I O
had O
done O
a O
good O
morning O
’ O
s O
work O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
was O
the O
identical O
ship O
that O
Yojo B-CHR
had O
provided O
to O
carry O
Queequeg B-CHR

me O
round O
the O
Cape O
. O
But O
I O
had O
not O
proceeded O
far O
, O
when O
I O
began O
to O
bethink O
me O
that O
the O
Captain O
with O
whom O
I O
was O
to O
sail O
yet O
remained O
unseen O
by O
me O
; O
though O
, O
indeed O
, O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
a O
whale-ship O
will O
be O
completely O
fitted O
out O
, O
and O
receive O
all O
her O
crew O
on O
board O
, O
ere O
the O
captain O
makes O
himself O
visible O
by O
arriving O
to O
take O
command O
; O
for O
sometimes O
these O
voyages O
are O
so O
prolonged O
, O
and O
the O
shore O
intervals O
at O
home O
so O
exceedingly O
brief O
, O
that O
if O
the O
captain O
have O
a O
family O
, O
or O
any O
absorbing O
concernment O
of O
that O
sort O
, O
he O
does O
not O
trouble O
himself O
much O
about O
his O
ship O
in O
port O
, O
but O
leaves O
her O
to O
the O
owners O
till O
all O
is O
ready O
for O
sea O
. O
However O
, O
it O
is O
always O
as O
well O
to O
have O
a O
look O
at O
him O
before O
irrevocably O
committing O
yourself O
into O
his O
hands O
. O
Turning O
back O
I O
accosted O
Captain B-CHR
Peleg I-CHR

inquiring O
where O
Captain B-CHR

“ O

bleeding O
stump O
that O
brought O
that O
about O
, O
as O
any O
one O
might O
see O
. O
I O
know O
, O
too O
, O
that O
ever O
since O
he O
lost O
his O
leg O
last O
voyage O
by O
that O
accursed O
whale O
, O
he O
’ O
s O
been O
a O
kind O
of O
moody—desperate O
moody O
, O
and O
savage O
sometimes O
; O
but O
that O
will O
all O
pass O
off O
. O
And O
once O
for O
all O
, O
let O
me O
tell O
thee O
and O
assure O
thee O
, O
young O
man O
, O
it O
’ O
s O
better O
to O
sail O
with O
a O
moody O
good O
captain O
than O
a O
laughing O
bad O
one O
. O
So O
good-bye O
to O
thee—and O
wrong O
not O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
, O
because O
he O
happens O
to O
have O
a O
wicked O
name O
. O
Besides O
, O
my O
boy O
, O
he O
has O
a O
wife—not O
three O
voyages O
wedded—a O
sweet O
, O
resigned O
girl O
. O
Think O
of O
that O
; O
by O
that O
sweet O
girl O
that O
old O
man O
has O
a O
child O
: O
hold O
ye O
then O
there O
can O
be O
any O
utter O
, O
hopeless O
harm O
in O
Ahab B-CHR
? O
No O
, O
no O
, O
my O
lad O
; O
stricken O
, O
blasted O
, O
if O
he O
be O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
has O
his O
humanities O
! O
” O
As O
I O
walked O
away O
, O
I O
was O
full O
of O
thoughtfulness O
; O
what O
had O
been O
incidentally O
revealed O
to O
me O
of O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
, O
filled O
me O
with O
a O
certain O
wild O
vagueness O
of O
painfulness O
concerning O
him O
. O
And O
somehow O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
I O
felt O
a O
sympathy O
and O
a O
sorrow O
for O
him O
, O
but O
for O
I O
don O
’ O
t O
know O
what O
, O
unless O
it O
was O
the O
cruel O
loss O
of O
his O
leg O
. O
And O
yet O
I O
also O
felt O
a O
strange O
awe O
of O
him O
; O
but O
that O
sort O
of O
awe O
, O
which O
I O
can O
not O
at O
all O
describe O
, O
was O
not O
exactly O
awe O
; O
I O
do O
not O
know O
what O
it O
was O
. O
But O
I O
felt O
it O
; O
and O
it O
did O
not O
disincline O
me O
towards O
him O
; O
though O
I O
felt O
impatience O
at O
what O
seemed O
like O
mystery O
in O
him O
, O
so O
imperfectly O
as O
he O
was O
known O
to O
me O
then O
. O
However O
, O
my O
thoughts O
were O
at O
length O
carried O
in O
other O
directions O
, O
so O
that O
for O
the O
present O
dark O
Ahab B-CHR
slipped O
my O
mind O
