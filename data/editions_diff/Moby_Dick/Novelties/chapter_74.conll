Here O
, O
now O
, O
are O
two O
great O
whales O
, O
laying O
their O
heads O
together O
; O
let O
us O
join O
them O
, O
and O
lay O
together O
our O
own O
. O
Of O
the O
grand O
order O
of O
folio O
leviathans O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
and O
the O
Right O
Whale O
are O
by O
far O
the O
most O
noteworthy O
. O
They O
are O
the O
only O
whales O
regularly O
hunted O
by O
man O
. O
To O
the O
Nantucketer B-GRP
, O
they O
present O
the O
two O
extremes O
of O
all O
the O
known O
varieties O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
As O
the O
external O
difference O
between O
them O
is O
mainly O
observable O
in O
their O
heads O
; O
and O
as O
a O
head O
of O
each O
is O
this O
moment O
hanging O
from O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
side O
; O
and O
as O
we O
may O
freely O
go O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
, O
by O
merely O
stepping O
across O
the O
deck O
: O
—where O
, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
, O
will O
you O
obtain O
a O
better O
chance O
to O
study O
practical O
cetology O
than O
here O
? O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
you O
are O
struck O
by O
the O
general O
contrast O
between O
these O
heads O
. O
Both O
are O
massive O
enough O
in O
all O
conscience O
; O
but O
there O
is O
a O
certain O
mathematical O
symmetry O
in O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
’ O
s O
which O
the O
Right O
Whale O
’ O
s O
sadly O
lacks O
. O
There O
is O
more O
character O
in O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
’ O
s O
head O
. O
As O
you O
behold O
it O
, O
you O
involuntarily O
yield O
the O
immense O
superiority O
to O
him O
, O
in O
point O
of O
pervading O
dignity O
. O
In O
the O
present O
instance O
, O
too O
, O
this O
dignity O
is O
heightened O
by O
the O
pepper O
and O
salt O
colour O
of O
his O
head O
at O
the O
summit O
, O
giving O
token O
of O
advanced O
age O
and O
large O
experience O
. O
In O
short O
, O
he O
is O
what O
the O
fishermen O
technically O
call O
a O
“ O
grey-headed O
whale O
. O
” O
Let O
us O
now O
note O
what O
is O
least O
dissimilar O
in O
these O
heads—namely O
, O
the O
two O
most O
important O
organs O
, O
the O
eye O
and O
the O
ear O
. O
Far O
back O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
head O
, O
and O
low O
down O
, O
near O
the O
angle O
of O
either O
whale O
’ O
s O
jaw O
, O
if O
you O
narrowly O
search O
, O
you O
will O
at O
last O
see O
a O
lashless O
eye O
, O
which O
you O
would O
fancy O
to O
be O
a O
young O
colt O
’ O
s O
eye O
; O
so O
out O
of O
all O
proportion O
is O
it O
to O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
head O
. O
Now O
, O
from O
this O
peculiar O
sideway O
position O
of O
the O
whale O
’ O
s O
eyes O
, O
it O
is O
plain O
that O
he O
can O
never O
see O
an O
object O
which O
is O
exactly O
ahead O
, O
no O
more O
than O
he O
can O
one O
exactly O
astern O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
the O
position O
of O
the O
whale O
’ O
s O
eyes O
corresponds O
to O
that O
of O
a O
man O
’ O
s O
ears O
; O
and O
you O
may O
fancy O
, O
for O
yourself O
, O
how O
it O
would O
fare O
with O
you O
, O
did O
you O
sideways O
survey O
objects O
through O
your O
ears O
. O
You O
would O
find O
that O
you O
could O
only O
command O
some O
thirty O
degrees O
of O
vision O
in O
advance O
of O
the O
straight O
side-line O
of O
sight O
; O
and O
about O
thirty O
more O
behind O
it O
. O
If O
your O
bitterest O
foe O
were O
walking O
straight O
towards O
you O
, O
with O
dagger O
uplifted O
in O
broad O
day O
, O
you O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
see O
him O
, O
any O
more O
than O
if O
he O
were O
stealing O
upon O
you O
from O
behind O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
you O
would O
have O
two O
backs O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
; O
but O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
also O
, O
two O
fronts O
( O
side O
fronts O
) O
: O
for O
what O
is O
it O
that O
makes O
the O
front O
of O
a O
man—what O
, O
indeed O
, O
but O
his O
eyes O
? O
Moreover O
, O
while O
in O
most O
other O
animals O
that O
I O
can O
now O
think O
of O
, O
the O
eyes O
are O
so O
planted O
as O
imperceptibly O
to O
blend O
their O
visual O
power O
, O
so O
as O
to O
produce O
one O
picture O
and O
not O
two O
to O
the O
brain O
; O
the O
peculiar O
position O
of O
the O
whale O
’ O
s O
eyes O
, O
effectually O
divided O
as O
they O
are O
by O
many O
cubic O
feet O
of O
solid O
head O
, O
which O
towers O
between O
them O
like O
a O
great O
mountain O
separating O
two O
lakes O
in O
valleys O
; O
this O
, O
of O
course O
, O
must O
wholly O
separate O
the O
impressions O
which O
each O
independent O
organ O
imparts O
. O
The O
whale O
, O
therefore O
, O
must O
see O
one O
distinct O
picture O
on O
this O
side O
, O
and O
another O
distinct O
picture O
on O
that O
side O
; O
while O
all O
between O
must O
be O
profound O
darkness O
and O
nothingness O
to O
him O
. O
Man O
may O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
be O
said O
to O
look O
out O
on O
the O
world O
from O
a O
sentry-box O
with O
two O
joined O
sashes O
for O
his O
window O
. O
But O
with O
the O
whale O
, O
these O
two O
sashes O
are O
separately O
inserted O
, O
making O
two O
distinct O
windows O
, O
but O
sadly O
impairing O
the O
view O
. O
This O
peculiarity O
of O
the O
whale O
’ O
s O
eyes O
is O
a O
thing O
always O
to O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
in O
the O
fishery O
; O
and O
to O
be O
remembered O
by O
the O
reader O
in O
some O
subsequent O
scenes O
. O
A O
curious O
and O
most O
puzzling O
question O
might O
be O
started O
concerning O
this O
visual O
matter O
as O
touching O
the O
Leviathan B-CHR
. O
But O
I O
must O
be O
content O
with O
a O
hint O
. O
So O
long O
as O
a O
man O
’ O
s O
eyes O
are O
open O
in O
the O
light O
, O
the O
act O
of O
seeing O
is O
involuntary O
; O
that O
is O
, O
he O
can O
not O
then O
help O
mechanically O
seeing O
whatever O
objects O
are O
before O
him O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
any O
one O
’ O
s O
experience O
will O
teach O
him O
, O
that O
though O
he O
can O
take O
in O
an O
undiscriminating O
sweep O
of O
things O
at O
one O
glance O
, O
it O
is O
quite O
impossible O
for O
him O
, O
attentively O
, O
and O
completely O
, O
to O
examine O
any O
two O
things—however O
large O
or O
however O
small—at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
instant O
of O
time O
; O
never O
mind O
if O
they O
lie O
side O
by O
side O
and O
touch O
each O
other O
. O
But O
if O
you O
now O
come O
to O
separate O
these O
two O
objects O
, O
and O
surround O
each O
by O
a O
circle O
of O
profound O
darkness O
; O
then O
, O
in O
order O
to O
see O
one O
of O
them O
, O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
to O
bring O
your O
mind O
to O
bear O
on O
it O
, O
the O
other O
will O
be O
utterly O
excluded O
from O
your O
contemporary O
consciousness O
. O
How O
is O
it O
, O
then O
, O
with O
the O
whale O
? O
True O
, O
both O
his O
eyes O
, O
in O
themselves O
, O
must O
simultaneously O
act O
; O
but O
is O
his O
brain O
so O
much O
more O
comprehensive O
, O
combining O
, O
and O
subtle O
than O
man O
’ O
s O
, O
that O
he O
can O
at O
the O
same O
moment O
of O
time O
attentively O
examine O
two O
distinct O
prospects O
, O
one O
on O
one O
side O
of O
him O
, O
and O
the O
other O
in O
an O
exactly O
opposite O
direction O
? O
If O
he O
can O
, O
then O
is O
it O
as O
marvellous O
a O
thing O
in O
him O
, O
as O
if O
a O
man O
were O
able O
simultaneously O
to O
go O
through O
the O
demonstrations O
of O
two O
distinct O
problems O
in O
Euclid B-MSC
. O
Nor O
, O
strictly O
investigated O
, O
is O
there O
any O
incongruity O
in O
this O
comparison O
. O
It O
may O
be O
but O
an O
idle O
whim O
, O
but O
it O
has O
always O
seemed O
to O
me O
, O
that O
the O
extraordinary O
vacillations O
of O
movement O
displayed O
by O
some O
whales O
when O
beset O
by O
three O
or O
four O
boats O
; O
the O
timidity O
and O
liability O
to O
queer O
frights O
, O
so O
common O
to O
such O
whales O
; O
I O
think O
that O
all O
this O
indirectly O
proceeds O
from O
the O
helpless O
perplexity O
of O
volition O
, O
in O
which O
their O
divided O
and O
diametrically O
opposite O
powers O
of O
vision O
must O
involve O
them O
. O
But O
the O
ear O
of O
the O
whale O
is O
full O
as O
curious O
as O
the O
eye O
. O
If O
you O
are O
an O
entire O
stranger O
to O
their O
race O
, O
you O
might O
hunt O
over O
these O
two O
heads O
for O
hours O
, O
and O
never O
discover O
that O
organ O
. O
The O
ear O
has O
no O
external O
leaf O
whatever O
; O
and O
into O
the O
hole O
itself O
you O
can O
hardly O
insert O
a O
quill O
, O
so O
wondrously O
minute O
is O
it O
. O
It O
is O
lodged O
a O
little O
behind O
the O
eye O
. O
With O
respect O
to O
their O
ears O
, O
this O
important O
difference O
is O
to O
be O
observed O
between O
the O
sperm O
whale O
and O
the O
right O
. O
While O
the O
ear O
of O
the O
former O
has O
an O
external O
opening O
, O
that O
of O
the O
latter O
is O
entirely O
and O
evenly O
covered O
over O
with O
a O
membrane O
, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
quite O
imperceptible O
from O
without O
. O
Is O
it O
not O
curious O
, O
that O
so O
vast O
a O
being O
as O
the O
whale O
should O
see O
the O
world O
through O
so O
small O
an O
eye O
, O
and O
hear O
the O
thunder O
through O
an O
ear O
which O
is O
smaller O
than O
a O
hare O
’ O
s O
? O
But O
if O
his O
eyes O
were O
broad O
as O
the O
lens O
of O
Herschel B-CHR
’ O
s O
great O
telescope O
; O
and O
his O
ears O
capacious O
as O
the O
porches O
of O
cathedrals O
; O
would O
that O
make O
him O
any O
longer O
of O
sight O
, O
or O
sharper O
of O
hearing O
? O
Not O
at O
all.—Why O
then O
do O
you O
try O
to O
“ O
enlarge O
” O
your O
mind O
? O
Subtilize O
it O
. O
Let O
us O
now O
with O
whatever O
levers O
and O
steam-engines O
we O
have O
at O
hand O
, O
cant O
over O
the O
sperm O
whale O
’ O
s O
head O
, O
that O
it O
may O
lie O
bottom O
up O
; O
then O
, O
ascending O
by O
a O
ladder O
to O
the O
summit O
, O
have O
a O
peep O
down O
the O
mouth O
; O
and O
were O
it O
not O
that O
the O
body O
is O
now O
completely O
separated O
from O
it O
, O
with O
a O
lantern O
we O
might O
descend O
into O
the O
great O
Kentucky B-LOC
Mammoth I-LOC
Cave I-LOC
of O
his O
stomach O
. O
But O
let O
us O
hold O
on O
here O
by O
this O
tooth O
, O
and O
look O
about O
us O
where O
we O
are O
. O
What O
a O
really O
beautiful O
and O
chaste-looking O
mouth O
! O
from O
floor O
to O
ceiling O
, O
lined O
, O
or O
rather O
papered O
with O
a O
glistening O
white O
membrane O
, O
glossy O
as O
bridal O
satins O
. O
But O
come O
out O
now O
, O
and O
look O
at O
this O
portentous O
lower O
jaw O
, O
which O
seems O
like O
the O
long O
narrow O
lid O
of O
an O
immense O
snuff-box O
, O
with O
the O
hinge O
at O
one O
end O
, O
instead O
of O
one O
side O
. O
If O
you O
pry O
it O
up O
, O
so O
as O
to O
get O
it O
overhead O
, O
and O
expose O
its O
rows O
of O
teeth O
, O
it O
seems O
a O
terrific O
portcullis O
; O
and O
such O
, O
alas O
! O
it O
proves O
to O
many O
a O
poor O
wight O
in O
the O
fishery O
, O
upon O
whom O
these O
spikes O
fall O
with O
impaling O
force O
. O
But O
far O
more O
terrible O
is O
it O
to O
behold O
, O
when O
fathoms O
down O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
you O
see O
some O
sulky O
whale O
, O
floating O
there O
suspended O
, O
with O
his O
prodigious O
jaw O
, O
some O
fifteen O
feet O
long O
, O
hanging O
straight O
down O
at O
right-angles O
with O
his O
body O
, O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
a O
ship O
’ O
s O
jib-boom O
. O
This O
whale O
is O
not O
dead O
; O
he O
is O
only O
dispirited O
; O
out O
of O
sorts O
, O
perhaps O
; O
hypochondriac O
; O
and O
so O
supine O
, O
that O
the O
hinges O
of O
his O
jaw O
have O
relaxed O
, O
leaving O
him O
there O
in O
that O
ungainly O
sort O
of O
plight O
, O
a O
reproach O
to O
all O
his O
tribe O
, O
who O
must O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
imprecate O
lock-jaws O
upon O
him O
. O
In O
most O
cases O
this O
lower O
jaw—being O
easily O
unhinged O
by O
a O
practised O
artist—is O
disengaged O
and O
hoisted O
on O
deck O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
extracting O
the O
ivory O
teeth O
, O
and O
furnishing O
a O
supply O
of O
that O
hard O
white O
whalebone O
with O
which O
the O
fishermen O
fashion O
all O
sorts O
of O
curious O
articles O
, O
including O
canes O
, O
umbrella-stocks O
, O
and O
handles O
to O
riding-whips O
. O
With O
a O
long O
, O
weary O
hoist O
the O
jaw O
is O
dragged O
on O
board O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
an O
anchor O
; O
and O
when O
the O
proper O
time O
comes—some O
few O
days O
after O
the O
other O
work O
— O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
Daggoo B-CHR
, O
and O
Tashtego B-CHR
, O
being O
all O
accomplished O
dentists O
, O
are O
set O
to O
drawing O
teeth O
. O
With O
a O
keen O
cutting-spade O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
lances O
the O
gums O
; O
then O
the O
jaw O
is O
lashed O
down O
to O
ringbolts O
, O
and O
a O
tackle O
being O
rigged O
from O
aloft O
, O
they O
drag O
out O
these O
teeth O
, O
as O
Michigan B-LOC
oxen O
drag O
stumps O
of O
old O
oaks O
out O
of O
wild O
wood O
lands O
. O
There O
are O
generally O
forty-two O
teeth O
in O
all O
; O
in O
old O
whales O
, O
much O
worn O
down O
, O
but O
undecayed O
; O
nor O
filled O
after O
our O
artificial O
fashion O
. O
The O
jaw O
is O
afterwards O
sawn O
into O
slabs O
, O
and O
piled O
away O
like O
joists O
for O
building O
houses O
