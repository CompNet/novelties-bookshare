Had O
you O
followed O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
down O
into O
his O
cabin O
after O
the O
squall O
that O
took O
place O
on O
the O
night O
succeeding O
that O
wild O
ratification O
of O
his O
purpose O
with O
his O
crew O
, O
you O
would O
have O
seen O
him O
go O
to O
a O
locker O
in O
the O
transom O
, O
and O
bringing O
out O
a O
large O
wrinkled O
roll O
of O
yellowish O
sea O
charts O
, O
spread O
them O
before O
him O
on O
his O
screwed-down O
table O
. O
Then O
seating O
himself O
before O
it O
, O
you O
would O
have O
seen O
him O
intently O
study O
the O
various O
lines O
and O
shadings O
which O
there O
met O
his O
eye O
; O
and O
with O
slow O
but O
steady O
pencil O
trace O
additional O
courses O
over O
spaces O
that O
before O
were O
blank O
. O
At O
intervals O
, O
he O
would O
refer O
to O
piles O
of O
old O
log-books O
beside O
him O
, O
wherein O
were O
set O
down O
the O
seasons O
and O
places O
in O
which O
, O
on O
various O
former O
voyages O
of O
various O
ships O
, O
sperm O
whales O
had O
been O
captured O
or O
seen O
. O
While O
thus O
employed O
, O
the O
heavy O
pewter O
lamp O
suspended O
in O
chains O
over O
his O
head O
, O
continually O
rocked O
with O
the O
motion O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
for O
ever O
threw O
shifting O
gleams O
and O
shadows O
of O
lines O
upon O
his O
wrinkled O
brow O
, O
till O
it O
almost O
seemed O
that O
while O
he O
himself O
was O
marking O
out O
lines O
and O
courses O
on O
the O
wrinkled O
charts O
, O
some O
invisible O
pencil O
was O
also O
tracing O
lines O
and O
courses O
upon O
the O
deeply O
marked O
chart O
of O
his O
forehead O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
this O
night O
in O
particular O
that O
, O
in O
the O
solitude O
of O
his O
cabin O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
thus O
pondered O
over O
his O
charts O
. O
Almost O
every O
night O
they O
were O
brought O
out O
; O
almost O
every O
night O
some O
pencil O
marks O
were O
effaced O
, O
and O
others O
were O
substituted O
. O
For O
with O
the O
charts O
of O
all O
four O
oceans O
before O
him O
, O
Ahab B-CHR
was O
threading O
a O
maze O
of O
currents O
and O
eddies O
, O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
more O
certain O
accomplishment O
of O
that O
monomaniac O
thought O
of O
his O
soul O
. O
Now O
, O
to O
any O
one O
not O
fully O
acquainted O
with O
the O
ways O
of O
the O
leviathans O
, O
it O
might O
seem O
an O
absurdly O
hopeless O
task O
thus O
to O
seek O
out O
one O
solitary O
creature O
in O
the O
unhooped O
oceans O
of O
this O
planet O
. O
But O
not O
so O
did O
it O
seem O
to O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
who O
knew O
the O
sets O
of O
all O
tides O
and O
currents O
; O
and O
thereby O
calculating O
the O
driftings O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
’ O
s O
food O
; O
and O
, O
also O
, O
calling O
to O
mind O
the O
regular O
, O
ascertained O
seasons O
for O
hunting O
him O
in O
particular O
latitudes O
; O
could O
arrive O
at O
reasonable O
surmises O
, O
almost O
approaching O
to O
certainties O
, O
concerning O
the O
timeliest O
day O
to O
be O
upon O
this O
or O
that O
ground O
in O
search O
of O
his O
prey O
. O
So O
assured O
, O
indeed O
, O
is O
the O
fact O
concerning O
the O
periodicalness O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
’ O
s O
resorting O
to O
given O
waters O
, O
that O
many O
hunters O
believe O
that O
, O
could O
he O
be O
closely O
observed O
and O
studied O
throughout O
the O
world O
; O
were O
the O
logs O
for O
one O
voyage O
of O
the O
entire O
whale O
fleet O
carefully O
collated O
, O
then O
the O
migrations O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
would O
be O
found O
to O
correspond O
in O
invariability O
to O
those O
of O
the O
herring-shoals O
or O
the O
flights O
of O
swallows O
. O
On O
this O
hint O
, O
attempts O
have O
been O
made O
to O
construct O
elaborate O
migratory O
charts O
of O
the O
sperm O

Since O
the O
above O
was O
written O

the O
statement O

By O
that O
circular O

it O
appears O
that O
precisely O
such O
a O
chart O

in O
course O

completion O

Ahab B-CHR

in O
crossing O
the O
widest O
expanses O

himself O

even O
then O
not O
to O
be O
wholly O
without O
prospect O
of O
a O
meeting O
. O
There O
was O
a O
circumstance O
which O
at O
first O
sight O
seemed O
to O
entangle O
his O
delirious O

still O
methodical O
scheme O
. O
But O
not O
so O
in O
the O
reality O
, O
perhaps O
. O
Though O
the O
gregarious O
sperm O
whales O
have O
their O
regular O
seasons O
for O
particular O
grounds O
, O
yet O
in O
general O
you O
can O
not O
conclude O
that O
the O
herds O
which O
haunted O
such O
and O
such O
a O
latitude O
or O
longitude O
this O
year O
, O
say O
, O
will O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
identically O
the O
same O
with O
those O
that O
were O
found O
there O
the O
preceding O
season O
; O
though O
there O
are O
peculiar O
and O
unquestionable O
instances O
where O
the O
contrary O
of O
this O
has O
proved O
true O
. O
In O
general O
, O
the O
same O
remark O
, O
only O
within O
a O
less O
wide O
limit O
, O
applies O
to O
the O
solitaries O
and O
hermits O
among O
the O
matured O
, O
aged O
sperm O
whales O
. O
So O
that O
though O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
had O
in O
a O
former O
year O
been O
seen O
, O
for O
example O
, O
on O
what O
is O
called O
the O
Seychelle B-LOC
ground O
in O
the O
Indian B-LOC
ocean I-LOC
, O
or O
Volcano B-LOC
Bay I-LOC
on O
the O
Japanese B-LOC
Coast I-LOC
; O
yet O
it O
did O
not O
follow O
, O
that O
were O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
to O
visit O
either O
of O
those O
spots O
at O
any O
subsequent O
corresponding O
season O
, O
she O
would O
infallibly O
encounter O
him O
there O
. O
So O
, O
too O
, O
with O
some O
other O
feeding O
grounds O
, O
where O
he O
had O
at O
times O
revealed O
himself O
. O
But O
all O
these O
seemed O
only O
his O
casual O
stopping-places O
and O
ocean-inns O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
not O
his O
places O
of O
prolonged O
abode O
. O
And O
where O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
chances O
of O
accomplishing O
his O
object O
have O
hitherto O
been O
spoken O
of O
, O
allusion O
has O
only O
been O
made O
to O
whatever O
way-side O
, O
antecedent O
, O
extra O
prospects O
were O
his O
, O
ere O
a O
particular O
set O
time O
or O
place O
were O
attained O
, O
when O
all O
possibilities O
would O
become O
probabilities O
, O
and O
, O
as O
Ahab B-CHR
fondly O
thought O
, O
every O
possibility O
the O
next O
thing O
to O
a O
certainty O
. O
That O
particular O
set O
time O
and O
place O
were O
conjoined O
in O
the O
one O
technical O
phrase—the O
Season-on-the-Line B-LOC
. O
For O
there O
and O
then O
, O
for O
several O
consecutive O
years O
, O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
had O
been O
periodically O
descried O
, O
lingering O
in O
those O
waters O
for O
awhile O
, O
as O
the O
sun O
, O
in O
its O
annual O
round O
, O
loiters O
for O
a O
predicted O
interval O
in O
any O
one O
sign O
of O
the O
Zodiac B-MSC
. O
There O
it O
was O
, O
too O
, O
that O
most O
of O
the O
deadly O
encounters O
with O
the O
white B-CHR
whale I-CHR
had O
taken O
place O
; O
there O
the O
waves O
were O
storied O
with O
his O
deeds O
; O
there O
also O
was O
that O
tragic O
spot O
where O
the O
monomaniac O
old O
man O
had O
found O
the O
awful O
motive O
to O
his O
vengeance O
. O
But O
in O
the O
cautious O
comprehensiveness O
and O
unloitering O
vigilance O
with O
which O
Ahab B-CHR
threw O
his O
brooding O
soul O
into O
this O
unfaltering O
hunt O
, O
he O
would O
not O
permit O
himself O
to O
rest O
all O
his O
hopes O
upon O
the O
one O
crowning O
fact O
above O
mentioned O
, O
however O
flattering O
it O
might O
be O
to O
those O
hopes O
; O
nor O
in O
the O
sleeplessness O
of O
his O
vow O
could O
he O
so O
tranquillize O
his O
unquiet O
heart O
as O
to O
postpone O
all O
intervening O
quest O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
had O
sailed O
from O
Nantucket B-LOC
at O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
the O
Season-on-the-Line B-LOC
. O
No O
possible O
endeavor O
then O
could O
enable O
her O
commander O
to O
make O
the O
great O
passage O
southwards O
, O
double O
Cape B-LOC
Horn I-LOC
, O
and O
then O
running O
down O
sixty O
degrees O
of O
latitude O
arrive O
in O
the O
equatorial O
Pacific B-LOC
in O
time O
to O
cruise O
there O
. O
Therefore O
, O
he O
must O
wait O
for O
the O
next O
ensuing O
season O
. O
Yet O
the O
premature O
hour O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
sailing O
had O
, O
perhaps O
, O
been O
correctly O
selected O
by O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
with O
a O
view O
to O
this O
very O
complexion O
of O
things O
. O
Because O
, O
an O
interval O
of O
three O
hundred O
and O
sixty-five O
days O
and O
nights O
was O
before O
him O
; O
an O
interval O
which O
, O
instead O
of O
impatiently O
enduring O
ashore O
, O
he O
would O
spend O
in O
a O
miscellaneous O
hunt O
; O
if O
by O
chance O
the O
White B-CHR
Whale I-CHR
, O
spending O
his O
vacation O
in O
seas O
far O
remote O
from O
his O
periodical O
feeding-grounds O
, O
should O
turn O
up O
his O
wrinkled O
brow O
off O
the O
Persian B-LOC

out O

And O
here O
, O

run O

in O
a O
breathless O
race O
; O
till O
a O
weariness O

faintness O
of O

came O
over O
him O
; O
and O
in O
the O
open O
air O
of O
the O

he O
would O
seek O
to O
recover O
his O

Ah O
, O
God B-CHR

what O
trances O

does O
that O
man O

who O
is O
consumed O

He O
sleeps O
with O
clenched O
hands O

and O
wakes O
with O
his O
own O
bloody O
nails O
in O
his O
palms O
. O
Often O
, O
when O
forced O
from O
his O
hammock O
by O
exhausting O
and O
intolerably O
vivid O
dreams O

the O
night O

which O
, O
resuming O
his O

of O
phrensies O
, O
and O
whirled O
them O
round O

round O
and O
round O
in O
his O
blazing O
brain O
, O
till O
the O
very O
throbbing O
of O
his O
life-spot O
became O
insufferable O
anguish O
; O
and O
when O
, O
as O
was O
sometimes O
the O
case O
, O
these O
spiritual O
throes O
in O
him O
heaved O
his O
being O
up O
from O
its O
base O
, O
and O
a O
chasm O
seemed O
opening O
in O
him O
, O
from O
which O
forked O
flames O
and O
lightnings O
shot O
up O
, O
and O
accursed O
fiends O
beckoned O
him O
to O
leap O
down O
among O
them O
; O
when O
this O
hell O
in O
himself O
yawned O
beneath O
him O
, O
a O
wild O
cry O
would O
be O
heard O
through O
the O
ship O
; O
and O
with O
glaring O
eyes O
Ahab B-CHR
would O
burst O
from O
his O
state O
room O
, O
as O
though O
escaping O
from O
a O
bed O
that O
was O
on O
fire O
. O
Yet O
these O
, O
perhaps O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
the O
unsuppressable O
symptoms O
of O
some O
latent O
weakness O
, O
or O
fright O
at O
his O
own O
resolve O
, O
were O
but O
the O
plainest O
tokens O
of O
its O
intensity O
. O
For O
, O
at O
such O
times O
, O
crazy O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
the O
scheming O
, O
unappeasedly O
steadfast O
hunter O
of O
the O
white B-CHR
whale I-CHR
; O
this O
Ahab B-CHR
that O
had O
gone O
to O
his O
hammock O
, O
was O
not O
the O
agent O
that O
so O
caused O
him O
to O
burst O
from O
it O
in O
horror O
again O
. O
The O
latter O
was O
the O
eternal O
, O
living O
principle O
or O
soul O
in O
him O
; O
and O
in O
sleep O
, O
being O
for O
the O
time O
dissociated O
from O
the O
characterizing O
mind O
, O
which O
at O
other O
times O
employed O
it O
for O
its O
outer O
vehicle O
or O
agent O
, O
it O
spontaneously O
sought O
escape O
from O
the O
scorching O
contiguity O
of O
the O
frantic O
thing O
, O
of O
which O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
it O
was O
no O
longer O
an O
integral O
. O
But O
as O
the O
mind O
does O
not O
exist O
unless O
leagued O
with O
the O
soul O
, O
therefore O
it O
must O
have O
been O
that O
, O
in O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
case O
, O
yielding O
up O
all O
his O
thoughts O
and O
fancies O
to O
his O
one O
supreme O
purpose O
; O
that O
purpose O
, O
by O
its O
own O
sheer O
inveteracy O
of O
will O
, O
forced O
itself O
against O
gods O
and O
devils O
into O
a O
kind O
of O
self-assumed O
, O
independent O
being O
of O
its O
own O
. O
Nay O
, O
could O
grimly O
live O
and O
burn O
, O
while O
the O
common O
vitality O
to O
which O
it O
was O
conjoined O
, O
fled O
horror-stricken O
from O
the O
unbidden O
and O
unfathered O
birth O
. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
tormented O
spirit O
that O
glared O
out O
of O
bodily O
eyes O
, O
when O
what O
seemed O
Ahab B-CHR
rushed O
from O
his O
room O
, O
was O
for O
the O
time O
but O
a O
vacated O
thing O
, O
a O
formless O
somnambulistic O
being O
, O
a O
ray O
of O
living O
light O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
but O
without O
an O
object O
to O
colour O
, O
and O
therefore O
a O
blankness O
in O
itself O
. O
God O
help O
thee O
, O
old O
man O

thy O
thoughts O
have O
created O
a O
creature O

thee O

he O
whose O
intense O
thinking O
thus O
makes O
him O
a O
Prometheus B-CHR

upon O
