Upon O
searching O
, O
it O
was O
found O
that O
the O
casks O
last O
struck O
into O
the O
hold O
were O
perfectly O
sound O
, O
and O
that O
the O
leak O
must O
be O
further O
off O
. O
So O
, O
it O
being O
calm O
weather O
, O
they O
broke O
out O
deeper O
and O
deeper O
, O
disturbing O
the O
slumbers O
of O
the O
huge O
ground-tier O
butts O
; O
and O
from O
that O
black O
midnight O
sending O
those O
gigantic O
moles O
into O
the O
daylight O
above O
. O
So O
deep O
did O
they O
go O
; O
and O
so O
ancient O
, O
and O
corroded O
, O
and O
weedy O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
lowermost O
puncheons O
, O
that O
you O
almost O
looked O
next O
for O
some O
mouldy O
corner-stone O
cask O
containing O
coins O
of O
Captain B-CHR
Noah I-CHR
, O
with O
copies O
of O
the O
posted O
placards O
, O
vainly O
warning O
the O
infatuated O
old O
world O
from O
the O
flood O
. O
Tierce O
after O
tierce O
, O
too O
, O
of O
water O
, O
and O
bread O
, O
and O
beef O
, O
and O
shooks O
of O
staves O
, O
and O
iron O
bundles O
of O
hoops O
, O
were O
hoisted O
out O
, O
till O
at O
last O
the O
piled O
decks O
were O
hard O
to O
get O
about O
; O
and O
the O
hollow O
hull O
echoed O
under O
foot O
, O
as O
if O
you O
were O
treading O
over O
empty O
catacombs O
, O
and O
reeled O
and O
rolled O
in O
the O
sea O
like O
an O
air-freighted O
demijohn O
. O
Top-heavy O
was O
the O
ship O
as O
a O
dinnerless O
student O
with O
all O
Aristotle B-CHR
in O
his O
head O
. O
Well O
was O
it O
that O
the O
Typhoons O
did O
not O
visit O
them O
then O
. O
Now O
, O
at O
this O
time O
it O
was O
that O
my O
poor O
pagan O
companion O
, O
and O
fast O
bosom-friend O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
was O
seized O
with O
a O
fever O
, O
which O
brought O
him O
nigh O
to O
his O
endless O
end O
. O
Be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
in O
this O
vocation O
of O
whaling O
, O
sinecures O
are O
unknown O
; O
dignity O
and O
danger O
go O
hand O
in O
hand O
; O
till O
you O
get O
to O
be O
Captain O
, O
the O
higher O
you O
rise O
the O
harder O
you O
toil O
. O
So O
with O
poor O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
who O
, O
as O
harpooneer O
, O
must O
not O
only O
face O
all O
the O
rage O
of O
the O
living O
whale O
, O
but—as O
we O
have O
elsewhere O
seen—mount O
his O
dead O
back O
in O
a O
rolling O
sea O
; O
and O
finally O
descend O
into O
the O
gloom O
of O
the O
hold O
, O
and O
bitterly O
sweating O
all O
day O
in O
that O
subterraneous O
confinement O
, O
resolutely O
manhandle O
the O
clumsiest O
casks O
and O
see O
to O
their O
stowage O
. O
To O
be O
short O
, O
among O
whalemen O
, O
the O
harpooneers O
are O
the O
holders O
, O
so O
called O
. O
Poor O
Queequeg B-CHR
! O
when O
the O
ship O
was O
about O
half O
disembowelled O
, O
you O
should O
have O
stooped O
over O
the O
hatchway O
, O
and O
peered O
down O
upon O
him O
there O
; O
where O
, O
stripped O
to O
his O
woollen O
drawers O
, O
the O
tattooed O
savage O
was O
crawling O
about O
amid O
that O
dampness O
and O
slime O
, O
like O
a O
green O
spotted O
lizard O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
a O
well O
. O
And O
a O
well O
, O
or O
an O
ice-house O
, O
it O
somehow O
proved O
to O
him O
, O
poor O
pagan O
; O
where O
, O
strange O
to O
say O
, O
for O
all O
the O
heat O
of O
his O
sweatings O
, O
he O
caught O
a O
terrible O
chill O
which O
lapsed O
into O
a O
fever O
; O
and O
at O
last O
, O
after O
some O
days O
’ O
suffering O
, O
laid O
him O
in O
his O
hammock O
, O
close O
to O
the O
very O
sill O
of O
the O
door O
of O
death O
. O
How O
he O
wasted O
and O
wasted O
away O
in O
those O
few O
long-lingering O
days O
, O
till O
there O
seemed O
but O
little O
left O
of O
him O
but O
his O
frame O
and O
tattooing O
. O
But O
as O
all O
else O
in O
him O
thinned O
, O
and O
his O
cheek-bones O
grew O
sharper O
, O
his O
eyes O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
seemed O
growing O
fuller O
and O
fuller O
; O
they O
became O
of O
a O
strange O
softness O
of O
lustre O
; O
and O
mildly O
but O
deeply O
looked O
out O
at O
you O
there O
from O
his O
sickness O
, O
a O
wondrous O
testimony O
to O
that O
immortal O
health O
in O
him O
which O
could O
not O
die O
, O
or O
be O
weakened O
. O
And O
like O
circles O
on O
the O
water O
, O
which O
, O
as O
they O
grow O
fainter O
, O
expand O
; O
so O
his O
eyes O
seemed O
rounding O
and O
rounding O
, O
like O
the O
rings O
of O
Eternity O
. O
An O
awe O
that O
can O
not O
be O
named O
would O
steal O
over O
you O
as O
you O
sat O
by O
the O
side O
of O
this O
waning O
savage O
, O
and O
saw O
as O
strange O
things O
in O
his O
face O
, O
as O
any O
beheld O
who O
were O
bystanders O
when O
Zoroaster B-CHR
died O
. O
For O
whatever O
is O
truly O
wondrous O
and O
fearful O
in O
man O
, O
never O
yet O
was O
put O
into O
words O
or O
books O
. O
And O
the O
drawing O
near O
of O
Death O
, O
which O
alike O
levels O
all O
, O
alike O
impresses O
all O
with O
a O
last O
revelation O
, O
which O
only O
an O
author O
from O
the O
dead O
could O
adequately O
tell O
. O
So O
that—let O
us O
say O
it O
again—no O
dying O
Chaldee B-GRP
or O
Greek B-GRP
had O
higher O
and O
holier O
thoughts O
than O
those O
, O
whose O
mysterious O
shades O
you O
saw O
creeping O
over O
the O
face O
of O
poor O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
as O
he O
quietly O
lay O
in O
his O
swaying O
hammock O
, O
and O
the O
rolling O
sea O
seemed O
gently O
rocking O
him O
to O
his O
final O
rest O
, O
and O
the O
ocean O
’ O
s O
invisible O
flood-tide O
lifted O
him O
higher O
and O
higher O
towards O
his O
destined O
heaven B-LOC
. O
Not O
a O
man O
of O
the O
crew O
but O
gave O
him O
up O
; O
and O
, O
as O
for O
Queequeg B-CHR
himself O
, O
what O
he O
thought O
of O
his O
case O
was O
forcibly O
shown O
by O
a O
curious O
favour O
he O
asked O
. O
He O
called O
one O
to O
him O
in O
the O
grey O
morning O
watch O
, O
when O
the O
day O
was O
just O
breaking O
, O
and O
taking O
his O
hand O
, O
said O
that O
while O
in O
Nantucket B-LOC
he O
had O
chanced O
to O
see O
certain O
little O
canoes O
of O
dark O
wood O
, O
like O
the O
rich O
war-wood O
of O
his O
native O
isle O
; O
and O
upon O
inquiry O
, O
he O
had O
learned O
that O
all O
whalemen O
who O
died O
in O
Nantucket B-LOC
, O
were O
laid O
in O
those O
same O
dark O
canoes O
, O
and O
that O
the O
fancy O
of O
being O
so O
laid O
had O
much O
pleased O
him O
; O
for O
it O
was O
not O
unlike O
the O
custom O
of O
his O
own O
race O
, O
who O
, O
after O
embalming O
a O
dead O
warrior O
, O
stretched O
him O
out O
in O
his O
canoe O
, O
and O
so O
left O
him O
to O
be O
floated O
away O
to O
the O
starry O
archipelagoes O
; O
for O
not O
only O
do O
they O
believe O
that O
the O
stars O
are O
isles O
, O
but O
that O
far O
beyond O
all O
visible O
horizons O
, O
their O
own O
mild O
, O
uncontinented O
seas O
, O
interflow O
with O
the O
blue O
heavens B-LOC
; O
and O
so O
form O
the O
white O
breakers O
of O
the O
milky O
way O
. O
He O
added O
, O
that O
he O
shuddered O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
being O
buried O
in O
his O
hammock O
, O
according O
to O
the O
usual O
sea-custom O
, O
tossed O
like O
something O
vile O
to O
the O
death-devouring O
sharks O
. O
No O
: O
he O
desired O
a O
canoe O
like O
those O
of O
Nantucket B-LOC
, O
all O
the O
more O
congenial O
to O
him O
, O
being O
a O
whaleman O
, O
that O
like O
a O
whale-boat O
these O
coffin-canoes O
were O
without O
a O
keel O
; O
though O
that O
involved O
but O
uncertain O
steering O
, O
and O
much O
lee-way O
adown O
the O
dim O
ages O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
this O
strange O
circumstance O
was O
made O
known O
aft O
, O
the O
carpenter O
was O
at O
once O
commanded O
to O
do O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O
s O
bidding O
, O
whatever O
it O
might O
include O
. O
There O
was O
some O
heathenish O
, O
coffin-coloured O
old O
lumber O
aboard O
, O
which O
, O
upon O
a O
long O
previous O
voyage O
, O
had O
been O
cut O
from O
the O
aboriginal O
groves O
of O
the O
Lackaday B-LOC
islands I-LOC
, O
and O
from O
these O
dark O
planks O
the O
coffin O
was O
recommended O
to O
be O
made O
. O
No O
sooner O
was O
the O
carpenter O
apprised O
of O
the O
order O
, O
than O
taking O
his O
rule O
, O
he O
forthwith O
with O
all O
the O
indifferent O
promptitude O
of O
his O
character O
, O
proceeded O
into O
the O
forecastle O
and O
took O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O

measure O
with O
great O
accuracy O
, O
regularly O
chalking O
Queequeg B-CHR

person O

shifted O
the O

“ O
Ah O

poor O
fellow O
! O
he O
’ O

have O
to O
die O

, O
” O
ejaculated O
the O
Long B-LOC
Island I-LOC
sailor O
. O
Going O
to O
his O
vice-bench O
, O
the O
carpenter O
for O
convenience O
sake O
and O
general O
reference O
, O
now O
transferringly O
measured O
on O
it O
the O
exact O
length O
the O
coffin O
was O
to O
be O
, O
and O
then O
made O
the O
transfer O
permanent O
by O
cutting O
two O
notches O
at O
its O
extremities O
. O
This O
done O
, O
he O
marshalled O
the O
planks O
and O
his O
tools O
, O
and O
to O
work O

When O
the O
last O
nail O
was O
driven O
, O
and O
the O
lid O
duly O
planed O

fitted O

he O
lightly O
shouldered O
the O
coffin O
and O
went O
forward O
with O
it O
, O
inquiring O
whether O

were O
ready O
for O

Overhearing O
the O
indignant O
but O
half-humorous O
cries O
with O
which O
the O
people O
on O
deck O
began O
to O
drive O
the O
coffin O
away O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
to O
every O
one O

commanded O
that O

be O
instantly O
brought O
to O
him O

nor O
was O
there O
any O
denying O
him O
; O
seeing O
that O
, O
of O
all O
mortals O
, O
some O
dying O
men O
are O
the O
most O
tyrannical O
; O
and O
certainly O
, O
since O
they O
will O
shortly O
trouble O
us O
so O
little O
for O
evermore O
, O
the O
poor O

indulged O
. O
Leaning O
over O
in O
his O
hammock O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
long O
regarded O
the O
coffin O
with O
an O
attentive O
eye O
. O
He O
then O
called O
for O
his O
harpoon O
, O
had O
the O
wooden O
stock O
drawn O
from O
it O
, O
and O
then O
had O
the O
iron O
part O
placed O
in O
the O
coffin O
along O
with O
one O
of O
the O
paddles O
of O
his O
boat O
. O
All O
by O
his O
own O
request O
, O
also O
, O
biscuits O
were O
then O
ranged O
round O

a O
flask O
of O
fresh O
water O
was O
placed O
at O
the O
head O

a O
small O
bag O
of O
woody O
earth O
scraped O
up O

rolled O
up O
for O
a O
pillow O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
now O
entreated O
to O
be O
lifted O
into O
his O
final O
bed O

that O
he O
might O
make O
trial O
of O
its O

if O
any O
it O
had O

He O
lay O
without O
moving O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
then O
told O
one O
to O
go O
to O
his O
bag O
and O
bring O
out O
his O
little O
god O
, O
Yojo B-CHR

Then O
crossing O
his O

” O
During O
all O
this O

Queequeg B-CHR
lay O
with O
closed O
eyes O
, O
as O
if O
in O
a O
dream O
. O
Pip B-CHR
was O
led O
away O
, O
and O
the O
sick O
man O
was O
replaced O
in O
his O
hammock O
. O
But O
now O
that O
he O
had O
apparently O
made O
every O
preparation O
for O
death O
; O
now O
that O
his O
coffin O
was O
proved O
a O
good O
fit O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
suddenly O
rallied O
; O
soon O
there O
seemed O
no O
need O
of O
the O
carpenter O
’ O
s O
box O
: O
and O
thereupon O
, O
when O
some O
expressed O
their O
delighted O
surprise O
, O
he O
, O
in O
substance O
, O
said O
, O
that O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
sudden O
convalescence O
was O
this O
; O
—at O
a O
critical O
moment O
, O
he O
had O
just O
recalled O
a O
little O
duty O
ashore O
, O
which O
he O
was O
leaving O
undone O
; O
and O
therefore O
had O
changed O
his O
mind O
about O
dying O
: O
he O
could O
not O
die O
yet O
, O
he O
averred O
. O
They O
asked O
him O
, O
then O
, O
whether O
to O
live O
or O
die O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
his O
own O
sovereign O
will O
and O
pleasure O
. O
He O
answered O
, O
certainly O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
it O
was O
Queequeg B-CHR
’ O
s O
conceit O
, O
that O
if O
a O
man O
made O
up O
his O
mind O
to O
live O
, O
mere O
sickness O
could O
not O
kill O
him O
: O
nothing O
but O
a O
whale O
, O
or O
a O
gale O
, O
or O
some O
violent O
, O
ungovernable O
, O
unintelligent O
destroyer O
of O
that O
sort O
. O
Now O
, O
there O
is O
this O
noteworthy O
difference O
between O
savage O
and O
civilized O
; O
that O
while O
a O
sick O
, O
civilized O
man O
may O
be O
six O
months O
convalescing O
, O
generally O
speaking O
, O
a O
sick O
savage O
is O
almost O
half-well O
again O
in O
a O
day O
. O
So O
, O
in O
good O
time O
my O
Queequeg B-CHR
gained O
strength O
; O
and O
at O
length O
after O
sitting O
on O
the O
windlass O
for O
a O
few O
indolent O
days O
( O
but O
eating O
with O
a O
vigorous O
appetite O
) O
he O
suddenly O
leaped O
to O
his O
feet O
, O
threw O
out O
his O
arms O
and O
legs O
, O
gave O
himself O
a O
good O
stretching O
, O
yawned O
a O
little O
bit O
, O
and O
then O
springing O
into O
the O
head O
of O
his O
hoisted O
boat O
, O
and O
poising O
a O
harpoon O
, O
pronounced O
himself O
fit O
for O
a O
fight O
. O
With O
a O
wild O
whimsiness O
, O
he O
now O
used O
his O
coffin O
for O
a O
sea-chest O
; O
and O
emptying O
into O
it O
his O
canvas O
bag O
of O
clothes O
, O
set O
them O
in O
order O
there O
. O
Many O
spare O
hours O
he O
spent O
, O
in O
carving O
the O
lid O
with O
all O
manner O
of O
grotesque O
figures O
and O
drawings O
; O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
hereby O
he O
was O
striving O
, O
in O
his O
rude O
way O
, O
to O
copy O
parts O
of O
the O
twisted O
tattooing O
on O
his O
body O
. O
And O
this O
tattooing O
had O
been O
the O
work O
of O
a O
departed O
prophet O
and O
seer O
of O
his O
island O
, O
who O
, O
by O
those O
hieroglyphic O
marks O
, O
had O
written O
out O
on O
his O
body O
a O
complete O
theory O
of O
the O
heavens B-LOC
and O
the O
earth O
, O
and O
a O
mystical O
treatise O
on O
the O
art O
of O
attaining O
truth O
; O
so O
that O
Queequeg B-CHR
in O
his O
own O
proper O
person O
was O
a O
riddle O
to O
unfold O
; O
a O
wondrous O
work O
in O
one O
volume O
; O
but O
whose O
mysteries O
not O
even O
himself O
could O
read O
, O
though O
his O
own O
live O
heart O
beat O
against O
them O
; O
and O
these O
mysteries O
were O
therefore O
destined O
in O
the O
end O
to O
moulder O
away O
with O
the O
living O
parchment O
whereon O
they O
were O
inscribed O
, O
and O
so O
be O
unsolved O
to O
the O
last O
. O
And O
this O
thought O
it O
must O
have O
been O
which O
suggested O
to O
Ahab B-CHR
that O
wild O
exclamation O
of O
his O
, O
when O
one O
morning O
turning O
away O
from O
surveying O
poor O
