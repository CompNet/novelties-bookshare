It O
was O
nearly O
six O
o O
’ O
clock O
, O
but O
only O
grey O
imperfect O
misty O
dawn O
, O
when O
we O
drew O
nigh O
the O
wharf O
. O
“ O
There O
are O
some O
sailors O
running O
ahead O
there O
, O
if O
I O
see O
right O
, O
” O
said O
I O
to O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
“ O
it O
can O

be O
shadows O
; O

off O
by O

, O

guess O
; O
come O
on O
! O
” O
“ O
Avast O
! O
” O
cried O
a O
voice O
, O
whose O
owner O
at O
the O
same O
time O
coming O
close O
behind O
us O
, O
laid O
a O
hand O
upon O
both O
our O
shoulders O
, O
and O
then O
insinuating O
himself O
between O
us O
, O
stood O
stooping O
forward O
a O
little O
, O
in O
the O
uncertain O
twilight O
, O
strangely O
peering O
from O
Queequeg B-CHR
to O
me O
. O
It O
was O
Elijah B-CHR
. O
“ O
Going O
aboard O
? O
” O
“ O
Hands O
off O
, O
will O
you O
, O
” O
said O
I O
. O
“ O
Lookee O
here O
, O
” O
said O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
shaking O
himself O
, O
“ O
go O
’ O
way O
! O
” O
“ O
Ain O
’ O
t O
going O
aboard O
, O
then O
? O
” O
“ O
Yes O
, O
we O
are O
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
“ O
but O
what O
business O
is O
that O
of O
yours O
? O
Do O
you O
know O
, O
Mr. B-CHR
Elijah I-CHR
, O
that O
I O
consider O
you O
a O
little O
impertinent O
? O
” O
“ O
No O
, O
no O
, O
no O
; O
I O
wasn O
’ O
t O
aware O
of O
that O
, O
” O
said O
Elijah B-CHR
, O
slowly O
and O
wonderingly O
looking O
from O
me O
to O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
with O
the O
most O
unaccountable O
glances O
. O
“ O
Elijah B-CHR
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
“ O
you O
will O
oblige O
my O
friend O
and O
me O
by O
withdrawing O
. O
We O
are O
going O
to O
the O
Indian O
and O
Pacific B-LOC
Oceans I-LOC
, O
and O
would O
prefer O
not O
to O
be O
detained O
. O
” O
“ O
Ye O
be O
, O
be O
ye O
? O
Coming O
back O
afore O
breakfast O
? O
” O
“ O
He O
’ O
s O
cracked O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
“ O
come O
on O
. O
” O
“ O
Holloa O
! O
” O
cried O
stationary O
Elijah B-CHR
, O
hailing O
us O
when O
we O
had O
removed O
a O
few O
paces O
. O
“ O
Never O
mind O
him O
, O
” O
said O
I O
, O
“ O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
come O
on O
. O
” O
But O
he O
stole O
up O
to O
us O
again O
, O
and O
suddenly O
clapping O
his O
hand O
on O
my O
shoulder O
, O
said— O
“ O
Did O
ye O
see O
anything O
looking O
like O
men O
going O
towards O
that O
ship O
a O
while O
ago O
? O
” O
Struck O
by O
this O
plain O
matter-of-fact O
question O
, O
I O
answered O
, O
saying O
, O
“ O
Yes O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
did O
see O
four O
or O
five O
men O
; O
but O
it O
was O
too O
dim O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
” O
“ O
Very O
dim O
, O
very O
dim O
, O
” O
said O
Elijah B-CHR
. O
“ O
Morning O
to O
ye O
. O
” O
Once O
more O
we O
quitted O
him O
; O
but O
once O
more O
he O
came O
softly O
after O
us O
; O
and O
touching O
my O
shoulder O
again O
, O
said O
, O
“ O
See O
if O
you O
can O
find O
’ O
em O
now O
, O
will O
ye O
? O
“ O
Find O

? O
” O
“ O
Morning O
to O
ye O
! O
morning O
to O
ye O
! O
” O
he O
rejoined O
, O
again O
moving O
off O
. O
“ O
Oh O
! O
I O
was O
going O
to O
warn O
ye O
against—but O
never O
mind O
, O
never O
mind—it O
’ O
s O
all O

, O
all O
in O
the O
family O
too O
; O
—sharp O
frost O

morning O

’ O

? O
Good-bye O
to O
ye O
. O
Shan O
’ O
t O
see O
ye O
again O
very O
soon O
, O
I O
guess O
; O
unless O
it O
’ O
s O
before O
the O
Grand O
Jury. O
” O
And O
with O
these O
cracked O
words O
he O
finally O
departed O
, O
leaving O
me O
, O
for O
the O
moment O
, O
in O
no O
small O
wonderment O
at O
his O
frantic O
impudence O
. O
At O
last O
, O
stepping O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
, O
we O
found O
everything O
in O
profound O
quiet O
, O
not O
a O
soul O
moving O
. O
The O
cabin O
entrance O
was O
locked O
within O
; O
the O
hatches O
were O
all O
on O
, O
and O
lumbered O
with O
coils O
of O
rigging O
. O
Going O
forward O
to O
the O
forecastle O
, O
we O
found O
the O
slide O
of O
the O
scuttle O
open O
. O
Seeing O
a O
light O
, O
we O
went O
down O
, O
and O
found O
only O
an O
old O
rigger O
there O
, O
wrapped O
in O
a O
tattered O
pea-jacket O
. O
He O
was O
thrown O
at O
whole O
length O
upon O
two O
chests O
, O
his O
face O
downwards O
and O
inclosed O
in O
his O
folded O
arms O
. O
The O
profoundest O
slumber O
slept O
upon O
him O
. O
“ O
Those O
sailors O
we O
saw O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
where O
can O
they O
have O
gone O
to O
? O
” O
said O
I O
, O
looking O
dubiously O
at O
the O
sleeper O
. O
But O
it O
seemed O
that O
, O
when O
on O
the O
wharf O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
had O
not O
at O
all O
noticed O
what O
I O
now O
alluded O
to O
; O
hence O
I O
would O
have O
thought O
myself O
to O
have O
been O
optically O
deceived O
in O
that O
matter O
, O
were O
it O
not O
for O
Elijah B-CHR
’ O
s O
otherwise O
inexplicable O
question O
. O
But O
I O
beat O
the O
thing O
down O
; O
and O
again O
marking O
the O
sleeper O
, O
jocularly O
hinted O
to O
Queequeg B-CHR
that O
perhaps O
we O
had O
best O
sit O
up O
with O
the O
body O
; O
telling O
him O
to O
establish O
himself O
accordingly O
. O
He O
put O
his O
hand O
upon O
the O
sleeper O
’ O
s O
rear O
, O
as O
though O
feeling O
if O
it O
was O
soft O
enough O
; O
and O
then O
, O
without O
more O
ado O
, O
sat O
quietly O
down O
there O
. O
“ O
Gracious O
! O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
don O
’ O
t O
sit O
there O
, O
” O
said O
I O
. O
“ O
Oh O
! O
perry O
dood O
seat O
, O
” O
said O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
“ O
my O
country O
way O
; O
won O
’ O
t O
hurt O
him O
face O
. O
” O
“ O
Face O
! O
” O
said O
I O
, O
“ O
call O
that O
his O
face O
? O
very O
benevolent O
countenance O
then O
; O
but O
how O
hard O
he O
breathes O
, O
he O
’ O
s O
heaving O
himself O
; O
get O
off O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
, O
you O
are O
heavy O
, O
it O
’ O
s O
grinding O
the O
face O
of O
the O
poor O
. O
Get O
off O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
! O
Look O
, O
he O
’ O
ll O
twitch O
you O
off O
soon O
. O
I O
wonder O
he O
don O
’ O
t O
wake O
. O
” O
Queequeg B-CHR
removed O
himself O
to O
just O
beyond O
the O
head O
of O
the O
sleeper O
, O
and O
lighted O
his O
tomahawk O
pipe O
. O
I O
sat O
at O
the O
feet O
. O
We O
kept O
the O
pipe O
passing O
over O
the O
sleeper O
, O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
upon O
questioning O
him O
in O
his O
broken O
fashion O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
gave O
me O
to O
understand O
that O
, O
in O
his O
land O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
settees O
and O
sofas O
of O
all O
sorts O
, O
the O
king O
, O
chiefs O
, O
and O
great O
people O
generally O
, O
were O
in O
the O
custom O
of O
fattening O
some O
of O
the O
lower O
orders O
for O
ottomans O
; O
and O
to O
furnish O
a O
house O
comfortably O
in O
that O
respect O
, O
you O
had O
only O
to O
buy O
up O
eight O
or O
ten O
lazy O
fellows O
, O
and O
lay O
them O
round O
in O
the O
piers O
and O
alcoves O
. O
Besides O
, O
it O
was O
very O
convenient O
on O
an O
excursion O
; O
much O
better O
than O
those O
garden-chairs O
which O
are O
convertible O
into O
walking-sticks O
; O
upon O
occasion O
, O
a O
chief O
calling O
his O
attendant O
, O
and O
desiring O
him O
to O
make O
a O
settee O
of O
himself O
under O
a O
spreading O
tree O
, O
perhaps O
in O
some O
damp O
marshy O
place O
. O
While O
narrating O
these O
things O
, O
every O
time O
Queequeg B-CHR
received O
the O
tomahawk O
from O
me O
, O
he O
flourished O
the O
hatchet-side O
of O
it O
over O
the O
sleeper O
’ O
s O
head O
. O
“ O
What O
’ O
s O
that O
for O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
? O
” O
“ O
Perry O
easy O
, O
kill-e O
; O
oh O
! O
perry O
easy O
! O
” O
He O
was O
going O
on O
with O
some O
wild O
reminiscences O
about O
his O
tomahawk-pipe O
, O
which O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
had O
in O
its O
two O
uses O
both O
brained O
his O
foes O
and O
soothed O
his O
soul O
, O
when O
we O
were O
directly O
attracted O
to O
the O
sleeping O
rigger O
. O
The O
strong O
vapor O
now O
completely O
filling O
the O
contracted O
hole O
, O
it O
began O
to O
tell O
upon O
him O
. O
He O
breathed O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
muffledness O
; O
then O
seemed O
troubled O
in O
the O
nose O
; O
then O
revolved O
over O
once O
or O
twice O
; O
then O
sat O
up O
and O
rubbed O
his O
eyes O
. O
“ O
Holloa O
! O
” O
he O
breathed O
at O
last O
, O
“ O
who O
be O
ye O
smokers O
? O
” O
“ O
Shipped O
men O
, O
” O
answered O
I O
, O
“ O
when O
does O
she O
sail O
? O
” O
“ O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
ye O
are O
going O
in O
her O
, O
be O
ye O
? O
She O
sails O
to-day O
. O
The O
Captain O
came O
aboard O
last O
night O
. O
” O
“ O
What O
Captain O
? O
— O
Ahab B-CHR
? O
” O
“ O
Who O
but O
him O
indeed O
? O
” O
I O
was O
going O
to O
ask O
him O
some O
further O
questions O
concerning O
Ahab B-CHR
, O
when O
we O
heard O
a O
noise O
on O
deck O
. O
“ O
Holloa O
! O
Starbuck B-CHR
’ O
s O
astir O
, O
” O
said O
the O
rigger O
. O
“ O
He O
’ O
s O
a O
lively O
chief O
mate O
, O
that O
; O
good O
man O
, O
and O
a O
pious O
; O
but O
all O
alive O
now O
, O
I O
must O
turn O
to. O
” O
And O
so O
saying O
he O
went O
on O
deck O
, O
and O
we O
followed O
. O
It O
was O
now O
clear O
sunrise O
. O
Soon O
the O
crew O
came O
on O
board O
in O
twos O
and O
threes O
; O
the O
riggers O
bestirred O
themselves O
; O
the O
mates O
were O
actively O
engaged O
; O
and O
several O
of O
the O
shore O
people O
were O
busy O
in O
bringing O
various O
last O
things O
on O
board O
. O
Meanwhile O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
remained O
invisibly O
enshrined O
within O
his O
cabin O
. O
