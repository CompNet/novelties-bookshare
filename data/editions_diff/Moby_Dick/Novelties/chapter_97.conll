Had O
you O
descended O
from O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
try-works O
to O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
forecastle O
, O
where O
the O
off O
duty O
watch O
were O
sleeping O
, O
for O
one O
single O
moment O
you O
would O
have O
almost O
thought O
you O
were O
standing O
in O
some O
illuminated O
shrine O
of O
canonized O
kings O
and O
counsellors O
. O
There O
they O
lay O
in O
their O
triangular O
oaken O
vaults O
, O
each O
mariner O
a O
chiselled O
muteness O
; O
a O
score O
of O
lamps O
flashing O
upon O
his O
hooded O
eyes O
. O
In O
merchantmen O
, O
oil O
for O
the O
sailor O
is O
more O
scarce O
than O
the O
milk O
of O
queens O
. O
To O
dress O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
and O
eat O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
and O
stumble O
in O
darkness O
to O
his O
pallet O
, O
this O
is O
his O
usual O
lot O
. O
But O
the O
whaleman O
, O
as O
he O
seeks O
the O
food O
of O
light O
, O
so O
he O
lives O
in O
light O
. O
He O
makes O
his O
berth O
an O
Aladdin B-CHR
’ O
s O
lamp O
, O
and O
lays O
him O
down O
in O
it O
; O
so O
that O
in O
the O
pitchiest O
night O
the O
ship O
’ O
s O
black O
hull O
still O
houses O
an O
illumination O
. O
See O
with O
what O
entire O
freedom O
the O
whaleman O
takes O
his O
handful O
of O
lamps—often O
but O
old O
bottles O
and O
vials O
, O
though—to O
the O
copper O
cooler O
at O
the O
try-works O
, O
and O
replenishes O
them O
there O
, O
as O
mugs O
of O
ale O
at O
a O
vat O
. O
He O
burns O
, O
too O
, O
the O
purest O
of O
oil O
, O
in O
its O
unmanufactured O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
unvitiated O
state O
; O
a O
fluid O
unknown O
to O
solar O
, O
lunar O
, O
or O
astral O
contrivances O
ashore O
. O
It O
is O
sweet O
as O
early O
grass O
butter O
in O
April O
. O
He O
goes O
and O
hunts O
for O
his O
oil O
, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
sure O
of O
its O
freshness O
and O
genuineness O
, O
even O
as O
the O
traveller O
on O
the O
prairie O
hunts O
up O
his O
own O
supper O
of O
game O
. O
