“ O
Who O
would O
have O
thought O
it O
, O
Flask B-CHR
! O
” O
cried O
Stubb B-CHR
; O
“ O
if O
I O
had O
but O
one O
leg O
you O
would O
not O
catch O
me O
in O
a O
boat O
, O
unless O
maybe O
to O
stop O
the O
plug-hole O
with O
my O
timber O
toe O
. O
Oh O
! O
he O
’ O
s O
a O
wonderful O
old O
man O
! O
” O
“ O
I O
don O
’ O
t O
think O
it O
so O
strange O
, O
after O
all O
, O
on O
that O
account O
, O
” O
said O
Flask B-CHR
. O
“ O
If O
his O
leg O
were O
off O
at O
the O
hip O
, O
now O
, O
it O
would O
be O
a O
different O
thing O
. O
That O
would O
disable O
him O
; O
but O
he O
has O
one O
knee O
, O
and O
good O
part O
of O
the O
other O
left O
, O
you O
know O
. O
” O
“ O
I O
don O
’ O
t O
know O
that O
, O
my O
little O
man O
; O
I O
never O
yet O
saw O
him O
kneel O
. O
” O
Among O
whale-wise O
people O
it O
has O
often O
been O
argued O
whether O
, O
considering O
the O
paramount O
importance O
of O
his O
life O
to O
the O
success O
of O
the O
voyage O
, O
it O
is O
right O
for O
a O
whaling O
captain O
to O
jeopardize O
that O
life O
in O
the O
active O
perils O
of O
the O
chase O
. O
So O
Tamerlane B-CHR
’ O
s O
soldiers O
often O
argued O
with O
tears O
in O
their O
eyes O
, O
whether O
that O
invaluable O
life O
of O
his O
ought O
to O
be O
carried O
into O
the O
thickest O
of O
the O
fight O
. O
But O
with O
Ahab B-CHR
the O
question O
assumed O
a O
modified O
aspect O
. O
Considering O
that O
with O
two O
legs O
man O
is O
but O
a O
hobbling O
wight O
in O
all O
times O
of O
danger O
; O
considering O
that O
the O
pursuit O
of O
whales O
is O
always O
under O
great O
and O
extraordinary O
difficulties O
; O
that O
every O
individual O
moment O
, O
indeed O
, O
then O
comprises O
a O
peril O
; O
under O
these O
circumstances O
is O
it O
wise O
for O
any O
maimed O
man O
to O
enter O
a O
whale-boat O
in O
the O
hunt O
? O
As O
a O
general O
thing O
, O
the O
joint-owners O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
must O
have O
plainly O
thought O
not O
. O
Ahab B-CHR
well O
knew O
that O
although O
his O
friends O
at O
home O
would O
think O
little O
of O
his O
entering O
a O
boat O
in O
certain O
comparatively O
harmless O
vicissitudes O
of O
the O
chase O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
being O
near O
the O
scene O
of O
action O
and O
giving O
his O
orders O
in O
person O
, O
yet O
for O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
to O
have O
a O
boat O
actually O
apportioned O
to O
him O
as O
a O
regular O
headsman O
in O
the O
hunt—above O
all O
for O
Captain B-CHR
Ahab I-CHR
to O
be O
supplied O
with O
five O
extra O
men O
, O
as O
that O
same O
boat O
’ O
s O
crew O
, O
he O
well O
knew O
that O
such O
generous O
conceits O
never O
entered O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
owners O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
. O
Therefore O
he O
had O
not O
solicited O
a O
boat O
’ O
s O
crew O
from O
them O
, O
nor O
had O
he O
in O
any O
way O
hinted O
his O
desires O
on O
that O
head O
. O
Nevertheless O
he O
had O
taken O
private O
measures O
of O
his O
own O
touching O
all O
that O
matter O
. O
Until O
Cabaco B-CHR
’ O
s O
published O
discovery O
, O
the O
sailors O
had O
little O
foreseen O
it O
, O
though O
to O
be O
sure O
when O
, O
after O
being O
a O
little O
while O
out O
of O
port O
, O
all O
hands O
had O
concluded O
the O
customary O
business O
of O
fitting O
the O
whaleboats O
for O
service O
; O
when O
some O
time O
after O
this O
Ahab B-CHR
was O
now O
and O
then O
found O
bestirring O
himself O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
making O
thole-pins O
with O
his O
own O
hands O
for O
what O
was O
thought O
to O
be O
one O
of O
the O
spare O
boats O
, O
and O
even O
solicitously O
cutting O
the O
small O
wooden O
skewers O
, O
which O
when O
the O
line O
is O
running O
out O
are O
pinned O
over O
the O
groove O
in O
the O
bow O
: O
when O
all O
this O
was O
observed O
in O
him O
, O
and O
particularly O
his O
solicitude O
in O
having O
an O
extra O
coat O
of O
sheathing O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
as O
if O
to O
make O
it O
better O
withstand O
the O
pointed O
pressure O
of O
his O
ivory O
limb O
; O
and O
also O
the O
anxiety O
he O
evinced O
in O
exactly O
shaping O
the O
thigh O
board O
, O
or O
clumsy O
cleat O
, O
as O
it O
is O
sometimes O
called O
, O
the O
horizontal O
piece O
in O
the O
boat O
’ O
s O
bow O
for O
bracing O
the O
knee O
against O
in O
darting O
or O
stabbing O
at O
the O
whale O
; O
when O
it O
was O
observed O
how O
often O
he O
stood O
up O
in O
that O
boat O
with O
his O
solitary O
knee O
fixed O
in O
the O
semi-circular O
depression O
in O
the O
cleat O
, O
and O
with O
the O
carpenter O
’ O
s O
chisel O
gouged O
out O
a O
little O
here O
and O
straightened O
it O
a O
little O
there O
; O
all O
these O
things O
, O
I O
say O
, O
had O
awakened O
much O
interest O
and O
curiosity O
at O
the O
time O
. O
But O
almost O
everybody O
supposed O
that O
this O
particular O
preparative O
heedfulness O
in O
Ahab B-CHR
must O
only O
be O
with O
a O
view O
to O
the O
ultimate O
chase O
of O
Moby B-CHR
Dick I-CHR
; O
for O
he O
had O
already O
revealed O
his O
intention O
to O
hunt O
that O
mortal O
monster O
in O
person O
. O
But O
such O
a O
supposition O
did O
by O
no O
means O
involve O
the O
remotest O
suspicion O
as O
to O
any O
boat O
’ O
s O
crew O
being O
assigned O
to O
that O
boat O
. O
Now O
, O
with O
the O
subordinate O
phantoms O
, O
what O
wonder O
remained O
soon O
waned O
away O
; O
for O
in O
a O
whaler O
wonders O
soon O
wane O
. O
Besides O
, O
now O
and O
then O
such O
unaccountable O
odds O
and O
ends O
of O
strange O
nations O
come O
up O
from O
the O
unknown O
nooks O
and O
ash-holes O
of O
the O
earth O
to O
man O
these O
floating O
outlaws O
of O
whalers O
; O
and O
the O
ships O
themselves O
often O
pick O
up O
such O
queer O
castaway O
creatures O
found O
tossing O
about O
the O
open O
sea O
on O
planks O
, O
bits O
of O
wreck O
, O
oars O
, O
whaleboats O
, O
canoes O
, O
blown-off O
Japanese B-GRP
junks O
, O
and O
what O
not O
; O
that O
Beelzebub B-CHR
himself O
might O
climb O
up O
the O
side O
and O
step O
down O
into O
the O
cabin O
to O
chat O
with O
the O
captain O
, O
and O
it O
would O
not O
create O
any O
unsubduable O
excitement O
in O
the O
forecastle O
. O
But O
be O
all O
this O
as O
it O
may O
, O
certain O
it O
is O
that O
while O
the O
subordinate O
phantoms O
soon O
found O
their O
place O
among O
the O
crew O
, O
though O
still O
as O
it O
were O
somehow O
distinct O
from O
them O
, O
yet O
that O
hair-turbaned O
Fedallah B-CHR
remained O
a O
muffled O
mystery O
to O
the O
last O
. O
Whence O
he O
came O
in O
a O
mannerly O
world O
like O
this O
, O
by O
what O
sort O
of O
unaccountable O
tie O
he O
soon O
evinced O
himself O
to O
be O
linked O
with O
Ahab B-CHR
’ O
s O
peculiar O
fortunes O
; O
nay O
, O
so O
far O
as O
to O
have O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
half-hinted O
influence O
; O
Heaven B-CHR
knows O
, O
but O
it O
might O
have O
been O
even O
authority O
over O
him O
; O
all O
this O
none O
knew O
. O
But O
one O
can O
not O
sustain O
an O
indifferent O
air O
concerning O
Fedallah B-CHR
. O
He O
was O
such O
a O
creature O
as O
civilized O
, O
domestic O
people O
in O
the O
temperate O
zone O
only O
see O
in O
their O
dreams O
, O
and O
that O
but O
dimly O
; O
but O
the O
like O
of O
whom O
now O
and O
then O
glide O
among O
the O
unchanging O
Asiatic B-GRP
communities O
, O
especially O
the O
Oriental B-GRP
isles O
to O
the O
east O
of O
the O
continent—those O
insulated O
, O
immemorial O
, O
unalterable O
countries O
, O
which O
even O
in O
these O
modern O
days O
still O
preserve O
much O
of O
the O
ghostly O
aboriginalness O
of O
earth O
’ O
s O
primal O
generations O
, O
when O
the O
memory O
of O
the O
first O
man O
was O
a O
distinct O
recollection O
, O
and O
all O
men O
his O
descendants O
, O
unknowing O
whence O
he O
came O
, O
eyed O
each O
other O
as O
real O
phantoms O
, O
and O
asked O
of O
the O
sun O
and O
the O
moon O
why O
they O
were O
created O
and O
to O
what O
end O
; O
when O
though O

according O
to O
Genesis B-MSC
, O
