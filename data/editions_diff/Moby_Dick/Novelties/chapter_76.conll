Ere O
quitting O
, O
for O
the O
nonce O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
’ O
s O
head O
, O
I O
would O
have O
you O
, O
as O
a O
sensible O
physiologist O
, O
simply—particularly O
remark O
its O
front O
aspect O
, O
in O
all O
its O
compacted O
collectedness O
. O
I O
would O
have O
you O
investigate O
it O
now O
with O
the O
sole O
view O
of O
forming O
to O
yourself O
some O
unexaggerated O
, O
intelligent O
estimate O
of O
whatever O
battering-ram O
power O
may O
be O
lodged O
there O
. O
Here O
is O
a O
vital O
point O
; O
for O
you O
must O
either O
satisfactorily O
settle O
this O
matter O
with O
yourself O
, O
or O
for O
ever O
remain O
an O
infidel O
as O
to O
one O
of O
the O
most O
appalling O
, O
but O
not O
the O
less O
true O
events O
, O
perhaps O
anywhere O
to O
be O
found O
in O
all O
recorded O
history O
. O
You O
observe O
that O
in O
the O
ordinary O
swimming O
position O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
the O
front O
of O
his O
head O
presents O
an O
almost O
wholly O
vertical O
plane O
to O
the O
water O
; O
you O
observe O
that O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
that O
front O
slopes O
considerably O
backwards O
, O
so O
as O
to O
furnish O
more O
of O
a O
retreat O
for O
the O
long O
socket O
which O
receives O
the O
boom-like O
lower O
jaw O
; O
you O
observe O
that O
the O
mouth O
is O
entirely O
under O
the O
head O
, O
much O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
indeed O
, O
as O
though O
your O
own O
mouth O
were O
entirely O
under O
your O
chin O
. O
Moreover O
you O
observe O
that O
the O
whale O
has O
no O
external O
nose O
; O
and O
that O
what O
nose O
he O
has—his O
spout O
hole—is O
on O
the O
top O
of O
his O
head O
; O
you O
observe O
that O
his O
eyes O
and O
ears O
are O
at O
the O
sides O
of O
his O
head O
, O
nearly O
one O
third O
of O
his O
entire O
length O
from O
the O
front O
. O
Wherefore O
, O
you O
must O
now O
have O
perceived O
that O
the O
front O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
’ O
s O
head O
is O
a O
dead O
, O
blind O
wall O
, O
without O
a O
single O
organ O
or O
tender O
prominence O
of O
any O
sort O
whatsoever O
. O
Furthermore O
, O
you O
are O
now O
to O
consider O
that O
only O
in O
the O
extreme O
, O
lower O
, O
backward O
sloping O
part O
of O
the O
front O
of O
the O
head O
, O
is O
there O
the O
slightest O
vestige O
of O
bone O
; O
and O
not O
till O
you O
get O
near O
twenty O
feet O
from O
the O
forehead O
do O
you O
come O
to O
the O
full O
cranial O
development O
. O
So O
that O
this O
whole O
enormous O
boneless O
mass O
is O
as O
one O
wad O
. O
Finally O
, O
though O
, O
as O
will O
soon O
be O
revealed O
, O
its O
contents O
partly O
comprise O
the O
most O
delicate O
oil O
; O
yet O
, O
you O
are O
now O
to O
be O
apprised O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
substance O
which O
so O
impregnably O
invests O
all O
that O
apparent O
effeminacy O
. O
In O
some O
previous O
place O
I O
have O
described O
to O
you O
how O
the O
blubber O
wraps O
the O
body O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
as O
the O
rind O
wraps O
an O
orange O
. O
Just O
so O
with O
the O
head O
; O
but O
with O
this O
difference O
: O
about O
the O
head O
this O
envelope O
, O
though O
not O
so O
thick O
, O
is O
of O
a O
boneless O
toughness O
, O
inestimable O
by O
any O
man O
who O
has O
not O
handled O
it O
. O
The O
severest O
pointed O
harpoon O
, O
the O
sharpest O
lance O
darted O
by O
the O
strongest O
human O
arm O
, O
impotently O
rebounds O
from O
it O
. O
It O
is O
as O
though O
the O
forehead O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
were O
paved O
with O
horses O
’ O
hoofs O
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
any O
sensation O
lurks O
in O
it O
. O
Bethink O
yourself O
also O
of O
another O
thing O
. O
When O
two O
large O
, O
loaded O
Indiamen O
chance O
to O
crowd O
and O
crush O
towards O
each O
other O
in O
the O
docks O
, O
what O
do O
the O
sailors O
do O
? O
They O
do O
not O
suspend O
between O
them O
, O
at O
the O
point O
of O
coming O
contact O
, O
any O
merely O
hard O
substance O
, O
like O
iron O
or O
wood O
. O
No O
, O
they O
hold O
there O
a O
large O
, O
round O
wad O
of O
tow O
and O
cork O
, O
enveloped O
in O
the O
thickest O
and O
toughest O
of O
ox-hide O
. O
That O
bravely O
and O
uninjured O
takes O
the O
jam O
which O
would O
have O
snapped O
all O
their O
oaken O
handspikes O
and O
iron O
crow-bars O
. O
By O
itself O
this O
sufficiently O
illustrates O
the O
obvious O
fact O
I O
drive O
at O
. O
But O
supplementary O
to O
this O
, O
it O
has O
hypothetically O
occurred O
to O
me O
, O
that O
as O
ordinary O
fish O
possess O
what O
is O
called O
a O
swimming O
bladder O
in O
them O
, O
capable O
, O
at O
will O
, O
of O
distension O
or O
contraction O
; O
and O
as O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
as O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
has O
no O
such O
provision O
in O
him O
; O
considering O
, O
too O
, O
the O
otherwise O
inexplicable O
manner O
in O
which O
he O
now O
depresses O
his O
head O
altogether O
beneath O
the O
surface O
, O
and O
anon O
swims O
with O
it O
high O
elevated O
out O
of O
the O
water O
; O
considering O
the O
unobstructed O
elasticity O
of O
its O
envelope O
; O
considering O
the O
unique O
interior O
of O
his O
head O
; O
it O
has O
hypothetically O
occurred O
to O
me O
, O
I O
say O
, O
that O
those O
mystical O
lung-celled O
honeycombs O
there O
may O
possibly O
have O
some O
hitherto O
unknown O
and O
unsuspected O
connexion O
with O
the O
outer O
air O
, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
susceptible O
to O
atmospheric O
distension O
and O
contraction O
. O
If O
this O
be O
so O
, O
fancy O
the O
irresistibleness O
of O
that O
might O
, O
to O
which O
the O
most O
impalpable O
and O
destructive O
of O
all O
elements O
contributes O
. O
Now O
, O
mark O
. O
Unerringly O
impelling O
this O
dead O
, O
impregnable O
, O
uninjurable O
wall O
, O
and O
this O
most O
buoyant O
thing O
within O
; O
there O
swims O
behind O
it O
all O
a O
mass O
of O
tremendous O
life O
, O
only O
to O
be O
adequately O
estimated O
as O
piled O
wood O
is—by O
the O
cord O
; O
and O
all O
obedient O
to O
one O
volition O
, O
as O
the O
smallest O
insect O
. O
So O
that O
when O
I O
shall O
hereafter O
detail O
to O
you O
all O
the O
specialities O
and O
concentrations O
of O
potency O
everywhere O
lurking O
in O
this O
expansive O
monster O
; O
when O
I O
shall O
show O
you O
some O
of O
his O
more O
inconsiderable O
braining O
feats O
; O
I O
trust O
you O
will O
have O
renounced O
all O
ignorant O
incredulity O
, O
and O
be O
ready O
to O
abide O
by O
this O
; O
that O
though O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
stove O
a O
passage O
through O
the O
Isthmus B-LOC
of I-LOC
Darien I-LOC
, O
and O
mixed O
the O
Atlantic B-LOC
with O
the O
Pacific B-LOC
, O
you O
would O
not O
elevate O
one O
hair O
of O
your O
eye-brow O
. O
For O
unless O
you O
own O
the O
whale O
, O
you O
are O
but O
a O
provincial O
and O
sentimentalist O
in O
Truth O
. O
But O
clear O
Truth O
is O
a O
thing O
for O
salamander O
giants O
only O
to O
encounter O
; O
how O
small O
the O
chances O
for O
the O
provincials O
then O
? O
What O
befell O
the O
weakling O
youth O
lifting O
the O
dread O
goddess O
