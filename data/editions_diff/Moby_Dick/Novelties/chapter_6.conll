If O
I O
had O
been O
astonished O
at O
first O
catching O
a O
glimpse O
of O
so O
outlandish O
an O
individual O
as O
Queequeg B-CHR
circulating O
among O
the O
polite O
society O
of O
a O
civilized O
town O
, O
that O
astonishment O
soon O
departed O
upon O
taking O
my O
first O
daylight O
stroll O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
. O
In O
thoroughfares O
nigh O
the O
docks O
, O
any O
considerable O
seaport O
will O
frequently O
offer O
to O
view O
the O
queerest O
looking O
nondescripts O
from O
foreign O
parts O
. O
Even O
in O
Broadway B-LOC
and O
Chestnut B-LOC
streets O
, O
Mediterranean B-GRP
mariners O
will O
sometimes O
jostle O
the O
affrighted O
ladies O
. O
Regent B-LOC
Street I-LOC
is O
not O
unknown O
to O
Lascars B-GRP
and O
Malays B-GRP
; O
and O
at O
Bombay B-LOC
, O
in O
the O
Apollo B-LOC
Green I-LOC
, O
live O
Yankees B-GRP
have O
often O
scared O
the O
natives O
. O
But O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
beats O
all O
Water B-LOC
Street I-LOC
and O
Wapping B-LOC
. O
In O
these O
last-mentioned O
haunts O
you O
see O
only O
sailors O
; O
but O
in O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
, O
actual O
cannibals O
stand O
chatting O
at O
street O
corners O
; O
savages O
outright O
; O
many O
of O
whom O
yet O
carry O
on O
their O
bones O
unholy O
flesh O
. O
It O
makes O
a O
stranger O
stare O
. O
But O
, O
besides O
the O
Feegeeans B-GRP
, O
Tongatobooarrs B-GRP
, O
Erromanggoans B-GRP
, O
Pannangians B-GRP
, O
and O
Brighggians B-GRP
, O
and O
, O
besides O
the O
wild O
specimens O
of O
the O
whaling-craft O
which O
unheeded O
reel O
about O
the O
streets O
, O
you O
will O
see O
other O
sights O
still O
more O
curious O
, O
certainly O
more O
comical O
. O
There O
weekly O
arrive O
in O
this O
town O
scores O
of O
green O
Vermonters B-GRP
and O
New B-LOC
Hampshire I-LOC
men O
, O
all O
athirst O
for O
gain O
and O
glory O
in O
the O
fishery O
. O
They O
are O
mostly O
young O
, O
of O
stalwart O
frames O
; O
fellows O
who O
have O
felled O
forests O
, O
and O
now O
seek O
to O
drop O
the O
axe O
and O
snatch O
the O
whale-lance O
. O
Many O
are O
as O
green O
as O
the O
Green B-LOC
Mountains I-LOC
whence O
they O
came O
. O
In O
some O
things O
you O
would O
think O
them O
but O
a O
few O
hours O
old O
. O
Look O
there O
! O
that O
chap O
strutting O
round O
the O
corner O
. O
He O
wears O
a O
beaver O
hat O
and O
swallow-tailed O
coat O
, O
girdled O
with O
a O
sailor-belt O
and O
sheath-knife O
. O
Here O
comes O
another O
with O
a O
sou O
’ O
-wester O
and O
a O
bombazine O
cloak O
. O
No O
town-bred O
dandy O
will O
compare O
with O
a O
country-bred O
one—I O
mean O
a O
downright O
bumpkin O
dandy—a O
fellow O
that O
, O
in O
the O
dog-days O
, O
will O
mow O
his O
two O
acres O
in O
buckskin O
gloves O
for O
fear O
of O
tanning O
his O
hands O
. O
Now O
when O
a O
country O
dandy O
like O
this O
takes O
it O
into O
his O
head O
to O
make O
a O
distinguished O
reputation O
, O
and O
joins O
the O
great O
whale-fishery O
, O
you O
should O
see O
the O
comical O
things O
he O
does O
upon O
reaching O
the O
seaport O
. O
In O
bespeaking O
his O
sea-outfit O
, O
he O
orders O
bell-buttons O
to O
his O
waistcoats O
; O
straps O
to O
his O
canvas O
trowsers O
. O
Ah O
, O
poor O
Hay-Seed O
! O
how O
bitterly O
will O
burst O
those O
straps O
in O
the O
first O
howling O
gale O
, O
when O
thou O
art O
driven O
, O
straps O
, O
buttons O
, O
and O
all O
, O
down O
the O
throat O
of O
the O
tempest O
. O
But O
think O
not O
that O
this O
famous O
town O
has O
only O
harpooneers O
, O
cannibals O
, O
and O
bumpkins O
to O
show O
her O
visitors O
. O
Not O
at O
all O
. O
Still O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
is O
a O
queer O
place O
. O
Had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
us O
whalemen O
, O
that O
tract O
of O
land O
would O
this O
day O
perhaps O
have O
been O
in O
as O
howling O
condition O
as O
the O
coast O
of O
Labrador B-LOC
. O
As O
it O
is O
, O
parts O
of O
her O
back O
country O
are O
enough O
to O
frighten O
one O
, O
they O
look O
so O
bony O
. O
The O
town O
itself O
is O
perhaps O
the O
dearest O
place O
to O
live O
in O
, O
in O
all O
New B-LOC
England I-LOC
. O
It O
is O
a O
land O
of O
oil O
, O
true O
enough O
: O
but O
not O
like O
Canaan B-LOC
; O
a O
land O
, O
also O
, O
of O
corn O
and O
wine O
. O
The O
streets O
do O
not O
run O
with O
milk O
; O
nor O
in O
the O
spring-time O
do O
they O
pave O
them O
with O
fresh O
eggs O
. O
Yet O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
this O
, O
nowhere O
in O
all O
America B-LOC
will O
you O
find O
more O
patrician-like O
houses O
; O
parks O
and O
gardens O
more O
opulent O
, O
than O
in O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
. O
Whence O
came O
they O
? O
how O
planted O
upon O
this O
once O
scraggy O
scoria O
of O
a O
country O
? O
Go O
and O
gaze O
upon O
the O
iron O
emblematical O
harpoons O
round O
yonder O
lofty O
mansion O
, O
and O
your O
question O
will O
be O
answered O
. O
Yes O
; O
all O
these O
brave O
houses O
and O
flowery O
gardens O
came O
from O
the O
Atlantic B-LOC
, O
Pacific B-LOC
, O
and O
Indian B-LOC
oceans I-LOC
. O
One O
and O
all O
, O
they O
were O
harpooned O
and O
dragged O
up O
hither O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
Can O
Herr B-CHR
Alexander I-CHR
perform O
a O
feat O
like O
that O
? O
In O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
, O
fathers O
, O
they O
say O
, O
give O
whales O
for O
dowers O
to O
their O
daughters O
, O
and O
portion O
off O
their O
nieces O
with O
a O
few O
porpoises O
a-piece O
. O
You O
must O
go O
to O
New B-LOC
Bedford I-LOC
to O
see O
a O
brilliant O
wedding O
; O
for O
, O
they O
say O
, O
they O
have O
reservoirs O
of O
oil O
in O
every O
house O
, O
and O
every O
night O
recklessly O
burn O
their O
lengths O
in O
spermaceti O
candles O
. O
In O
summer O
time O
, O
the O
town O
is O
sweet O
to O
see O
; O
full O
of O
fine O
maples—long O
avenues O
of O
green O
and O
gold O

And O
in O

passer-by O

tapering O
upright O
cones O

So O
omnipotent O
is O
art O
; O
which O
in O
many O
a O
district O
of O
New B-LOC

has O
superinduced O
bright O
terraces O
of O

And O

roses O

But O
roses O
only O

in O

the O
fine O
carnation O
