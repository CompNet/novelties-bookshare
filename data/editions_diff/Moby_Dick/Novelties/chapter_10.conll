Returning O
to O
the O
Spouter-Inn B-LOC
from O
the O
Chapel B-LOC
, O
I O
found O
Queequeg B-CHR
there O
quite O
alone O
; O
he O
having O
left O
the O
Chapel B-LOC
before O
the O
benediction O
some O
time O
. O
He O
was O
sitting O
on O
a O
bench O
before O
the O
fire O
, O
with O
his O
feet O
on O
the O
stove O
hearth O
, O
and O
in O
one O
hand O
was O
holding O
close O
up O
to O
his O
face O
that O
little O
negro O
idol O
of O
his O
; O
peering O
hard O
into O
its O
face O
, O
and O
with O
a O
jack-knife O
gently O
whittling O
away O
at O
its O
nose O
, O
meanwhile O
humming O
to O
himself O
in O
his O
heathenish O
way O
. O
But O
being O
now O
interrupted O
, O
he O
put O
up O
the O
image O
; O
and O
pretty O
soon O
, O
going O
to O
the O
table O
, O
took O
up O
a O
large O
book O
there O
, O
and O
placing O
it O
on O
his O
lap O
began O
counting O
the O
pages O
with O
deliberate O
regularity O
; O
at O
every O
fiftieth O
page—as O
I O
fancied—stopping O
a O
moment O
, O
looking O
vacantly O
around O
him O
, O
and O
giving O
utterance O
to O
a O
long-drawn O
gurgling O
whistle O
of O
astonishment O
. O
He O
would O
then O
begin O
again O
at O
the O
next O
fifty O
; O
seeming O
to O
commence O
at O
number O
one O
each O
time O
, O
as O
though O
he O
could O
not O
count O
more O
than O
fifty O
, O
and O
it O
was O
only O
by O
such O
a O
large O
number O
of O
fifties O
being O
found O
together O
, O
that O
his O
astonishment O
at O
the O
multitude O
of O
pages O
was O
excited O
. O
With O
much O
interest O
I O
sat O
watching O
him O
. O
Savage O
though O
he O
was O
, O
and O
hideously O
marred O
about O
the O
face—at O
least O
to O
my O
taste—his O
countenance O
yet O
had O
a O
something O
in O
it O
which O
was O
by O
no O
means O
disagreeable O
. O
You O
can O
not O
hide O
the O
soul O
. O
Through O
all O
his O
unearthly O
tattooings O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
saw O
the O
traces O
of O
a O
simple O
honest O
heart O
; O
and O
in O
his O
large O
, O
deep O
eyes O
, O
fiery O
black O
and O
bold O
, O
there O
seemed O
tokens O
of O
a O
spirit O
that O
would O
dare O
a O
thousand O
devils O
. O
And O
besides O
all O
this O
, O
there O
was O
a O
certain O
lofty O
bearing O
about O
the O
Pagan B-GRP
, O
which O
even O
his O
uncouthness O
could O
not O
altogether O
maim O
. O
He O
looked O
like O
a O
man O
who O
had O
never O
cringed O
and O
never O
had O
had O
a O
creditor O
. O
Whether O
it O
was O
, O
too O
, O
that O
his O
head O
being O
shaved O
, O
his O
forehead O
was O
drawn O
out O
in O
freer O
and O
brighter O
relief O
, O
and O
looked O
more O
expansive O
than O
it O
otherwise O
would O
, O
this O
I O
will O
not O
venture O
to O
decide O
; O
but O
certain O
it O
was O
his O
head O
was O
phrenologically O
an O
excellent O
one O
. O
It O
may O
seem O
ridiculous O
, O
but O
it O
reminded O
me O
of O
General B-CHR
Washington I-CHR
’ O
s O
head O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
the O
popular O
busts O
of O
him O
. O
It O
had O
the O
same O
long O
regularly O
graded O
retreating O
slope O
from O
above O
the O
brows O
, O
which O
were O
likewise O
very O
projecting O
, O
like O
two O
long O
promontories O
thickly O
wooded O
on O
top O
. O
Queequeg B-CHR
was O
George B-CHR
Washington I-CHR
cannibalistically O
developed O
. O
Whilst O
I O
was O
thus O
closely O
scanning O
him O
, O
half-pretending O
meanwhile O
to O
be O
looking O
out O
at O
the O
storm O
from O
the O
casement O
, O
he O
never O
heeded O
my O
presence O
, O
never O
troubled O
himself O
with O
so O
much O
as O
a O
single O
glance O
; O
but O
appeared O
wholly O
occupied O
with O
counting O
the O
pages O
of O
the O
marvellous O
book O
. O
Considering O
how O
sociably O
we O
had O
been O
sleeping O
together O
the O
night O
previous O
, O
and O
especially O
considering O
the O
affectionate O
arm O
I O
had O
found O
thrown O
over O
me O
upon O
waking O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
I O
thought O
this O
indifference O
of O
his O
very O
strange O
. O
But O
savages O
are O
strange O
beings O
; O
at O
times O
you O
do O
not O
know O
exactly O
how O
to O
take O
them O
. O
At O
first O
they O
are O
overawing O
; O
their O
calm O
self-collectedness O
of O
simplicity O
seems O
a O
Socratic O
wisdom O
. O
I O
had O
noticed O
also O
that O
Queequeg B-CHR
never O
consorted O
at O
all O
, O
or O
but O
very O
little O
, O
with O
the O
other O
seamen O
in O
the O
inn O
. O
He O
made O
no O
advances O
whatever O
; O
appeared O
to O
have O
no O
desire O
to O
enlarge O
the O
circle O
of O
his O
acquaintances O
. O
All O
this O
struck O
me O
as O
mighty O
singular O
; O
yet O
, O
upon O
second O
thoughts O
, O
there O
was O
something O
almost O
sublime O
in O
it O
. O
Here O
was O
a O
man O
some O
twenty O
thousand O
miles O
from O
home O
, O
by O
the O
way O
of O
Cape B-LOC
Horn I-LOC
, O
that O
is—which O
was O
the O
only O
way O
he O
could O
get O
there—thrown O
among O
people O
as O
strange O
to O
him O
as O
though O
he O
were O
in O
the O
planet O
Jupiter B-LOC
; O
and O
yet O
he O
seemed O
entirely O
at O
his O
ease O
; O
preserving O
the O
utmost O
serenity O
; O
content O
with O
his O
own O
companionship O
; O
always O
equal O
to O
himself O
. O
Surely O
this O
was O
a O
touch O
of O
fine O
philosophy O
; O
though O
no O
doubt O
he O
had O
never O
heard O
there O
was O
such O
a O
thing O
as O
that O
. O
But O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
be O
true O
philosophers O
, O
we O
mortals O
should O
not O
be O
conscious O
of O
so O
living O
or O
so O
striving O
. O
So O
soon O
as O
I O
hear O
that O
such O
or O
such O
a O
man O
gives O
himself O
out O
for O
a O
philosopher O
, O
I O
conclude O
that O
, O
like O
the O
dyspeptic O
old O
woman O
, O
he O
must O
have O
“ O
broken O
his O
digester O
. O
” O
As O
I O
sat O
there O
in O
that O
now O
lonely O
room O
; O
the O
fire O
burning O
low O
, O
in O
that O
mild O
stage O
when O
, O
after O
its O
first O
intensity O
has O
warmed O
the O
air O
, O
it O
then O
only O
glows O
to O
be O
looked O
at O
; O
the O
evening O
shades O
and O
phantoms O
gathering O
round O
the O
casements O
, O
and O
peering O
in O
upon O
us O
silent O
, O
solitary O
twain O
; O
the O
storm O
booming O
without O
in O
solemn O
swells O
; O
I O
began O
to O
be O
sensible O
of O
strange O
feelings O
. O
I O
felt O
a O
melting O
in O
me O
. O
No O
more O
my O
splintered O
heart O
and O
maddened O
hand O
were O
turned O
against O
the O
wolfish O
world O
. O
This O
soothing O
savage O
had O
redeemed O
it O
. O
There O
he O
sat O
, O
his O
very O
indifference O
speaking O
a O
nature O
in O
which O
there O
lurked O
no O
civilized O
hypocrisies O
and O
bland O
deceits O
. O
Wild O
he O
was O
; O
a O
very O
sight O
of O
sights O
to O
see O
; O
yet O
I O
began O
to O
feel O
myself O
mysteriously O
drawn O
towards O
him O
. O
And O
those O
same O
things O
that O
would O
have O
repelled O
most O
others O
, O
they O
were O
the O
very O
magnets O
that O
thus O
drew O
me O
. O
I O
’ O
ll O
try O
a O
pagan B-GRP
friend O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
since O
Christian B-GRP
kindness O
has O
proved O
but O
hollow O
courtesy O
. O
I O
drew O
my O
bench O
near O
him O
, O
and O
made O
some O
friendly O
signs O
and O
hints O
, O
doing O
my O
best O
to O
talk O
with O
him O
meanwhile O
. O
At O
first O
he O
little O
noticed O
these O
advances O
; O
but O
presently O
, O
upon O
my O
referring O
to O
his O
last O
night O
’ O
s O
hospitalities O
, O
he O
made O
out O
to O
ask O
me O
whether O
we O
were O
again O
to O
be O
bedfellows O
. O
I O
told O
him O
yes O
; O
whereat O
I O
thought O
he O
looked O
pleased O
, O
perhaps O
a O
little O
complimented O
. O
We O
then O
turned O
over O
the O
book O
together O
, O
and O
I O
endeavored O
to O
explain O
to O
him O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
printing O
, O
and O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
few O
pictures O
that O
were O
in O
it O
. O
Thus O
I O
soon O
engaged O
his O
interest O
; O
and O
from O
that O
we O
went O
to O
jabbering O
the O
best O
we O
could O
about O
the O
various O
outer O
sights O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
this O
famous O
town O
. O
Soon O
I O
proposed O
a O
social O
smoke O
; O
and O
, O
producing O
his O
pouch O
and O
tomahawk O
, O
he O
quietly O
offered O
me O
a O
puff O
. O
And O
then O
we O
sat O
exchanging O
puffs O
from O
that O
wild O
pipe O
of O
his O
, O
and O
keeping O
it O
regularly O
passing O
between O
us O
. O
If O
there O
yet O
lurked O
any O
ice O
of O
indifference O
towards O
me O
in O
the O
Pagan B-GRP
’ O
s O
breast O
, O
this O
pleasant O
, O
genial O
smoke O
we O
had O
, O
soon O
thawed O
it O
out O
, O
and O
left O
us O
cronies O
. O
He O
seemed O
to O
take O
to O
me O
quite O
as O
naturally O
and O
unbiddenly O
as O
I O
to O
him O
; O
and O
when O
our O
smoke O
was O
over O
, O
he O
pressed O
his O
forehead O
against O
mine O
, O
clasped O
me O
round O
the O
waist O
, O
and O
said O
that O
henceforth O
we O
were O
married O
; O
meaning O
, O
in O
his O
country O
’ O
s O
phrase O
, O
that O
we O
were O
bosom O
friends O
; O
he O
would O
gladly O
die O
for O
me O
, O
if O
need O
should O
be O
. O
In O
a O
countryman O
, O
this O
sudden O
flame O
of O
friendship O
would O
have O
seemed O
far O
too O
premature O
, O
a O
thing O
to O
be O
much O
distrusted O
; O
but O
in O
this O
simple O
savage O
those O
old O
rules O
would O
not O
apply O
. O
After O
supper O
, O
and O
another O
social O
chat O
and O
smoke O
, O
we O
went O
to O
our O
room O
together O
. O
He O
made O
me O
a O
present O
of O
his O
embalmed O
head O
; O
took O
out O
his O
enormous O
tobacco O
wallet O
, O
and O
groping O
under O
the O
tobacco O
, O
drew O
out O
some O
thirty O
dollars O
in O
silver O
; O
then O
spreading O
them O
on O
the O
table O
, O
and O
mechanically O
dividing O
them O
into O
two O
equal O
portions O
, O
pushed O
one O
of O
them O
towards O
me O
, O
and O
said O
it O
was O
mine O
. O
I O
was O
going O
to O
remonstrate O
; O
but O
he O
silenced O
me O
by O
pouring O
them O
into O
my O
trowsers O
’ O
pockets O
. O
I O
let O
them O
stay O
. O
He O
then O
went O
about O
his O
evening O
prayers O
, O
took O
out O
his O
idol O
, O
and O
removed O
the O
paper O
fireboard O
. O
By O
certain O
signs O
and O
symptoms O
, O
I O
thought O
he O
seemed O
anxious O
for O
me O
to O
join O
him O
; O
but O
well O
knowing O
what O
was O
to O
follow O
, O
I O
deliberated O
a O
moment O
whether O
, O
in O
case O
he O
invited O
me O
, O
I O
would O
comply O
or O
otherwise O
. O
I O
was O
a O
good O
Christian B-GRP
; O
born O
and O
bred O
in O
the O
bosom O
of O
the O
infallible O
Presbyterian B-GRP
Church I-GRP
. O
How O
then O
could O
I O
unite O
with O
this O
wild O
idolator O
in O
worshipping O
his O
piece O
of O
wood O
? O
But O
what O
is O
worship O
? O
thought O
I O
. O
Do O
you O
suppose O
now O
, O
Ishmael B-CHR
, O
that O
the O
magnanimous O
God B-CHR
of O
heaven B-LOC
and O
earth B-LOC
— O
pagans B-GRP
and O
all O
included—can O
possibly O
be O
jealous O
of O
an O
insignificant O
bit O
of O
black O
wood O
? O
Impossible O
! O
But O
what O
is O
worship O
? O
—to O
do O
the O
will O
of O
God B-CHR
— O
_that_ O
is O
worship O
. O
And O
what O
is O
the O
will O
of O
God B-CHR
? O
—to O
do O
to O
my O
fellow O
man O
what O
I O
would O
have O
my O
fellow O
man O
to O
do O
to O
me—_that_ O
is O
the O
will O
of O
God B-CHR
. O
Now O
, O
Queequeg B-CHR
is O
my O
fellow O
man O
. O
And O
what O
do O
I O
wish O
that O
this O
Queequeg B-CHR
would O
do O
to O
me O
? O
Why O
, O
unite O
with O
me O
in O
my O
particular O
Presbyterian B-GRP
form O
of O
worship O
. O
Consequently O
, O
I O
must O
then O
unite O
with O
him O
in O
his O
; O
ergo O
, O
I O
must O
turn O
idolator O
. O
So O
I O
kindled O
the O
shavings O
; O
helped O
prop O
up O
the O
innocent O
little O
idol O
; O
offered O
him O
burnt O
biscuit O
with O
Queequeg B-CHR
; O
salamed O
before O
him O
twice O
or O
thrice O
; O
kissed O
his O
nose O
; O
and O
that O
done O
, O
we O
undressed O
and O
went O
to O
bed O
, O
at O
peace O
with O
our O
own O
consciences O
and O
all O
the O
world O
. O
But O
we O
did O
not O
go O
to O
sleep O
without O
some O
little O
chat O
. O
How O
it O
is O
I O
know O
not O
; O
but O
there O
is O
no O
place O
like O
a O
bed O
for O
confidential O
disclosures O
between O
friends O
. O
Man O
and O
wife O
, O
they O
say O
, O
there O
open O
the O
very O
bottom O
of O
their O
souls O
to O
each O
other O
; O
and O
some O
old O
couples O
often O
lie O
and O
chat O
over O
old O
times O
till O
nearly O
morning O
. O
Thus O
, O
then O
, O
in O
our O
hearts O
’ O
honeymoon O
, O
lay O
I O
and O
Queequeg B-CHR
— O
a O
cosy O
, O
loving O
pair O
. O
