It O
was O
but O
some O
few O
days O
after O
encountering O
the O
Frenchman B-GRP
, O
that O
a O
most O
significant O
event O
befell O
the O
most O
insignificant O
of O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
’ O
s O
crew O
; O
an O
event O
most O
lamentable O
; O
and O
which O
ended O
in O
providing O
the O
sometimes O
madly O
merry O
and O
predestinated O
craft O
with O
a O
living O
and O
ever O
accompanying O
prophecy O
of O
whatever O
shattered O
sequel O
might O
prove O
her O
own O
. O
Now O
, O
in O
the O
whale O
ship O
, O
it O
is O
not O
every O
one O
that O
goes O
in O
the O
boats O
. O
Some O
few O
hands O
are O
reserved O
called O
ship-keepers O
, O
whose O
province O
it O
is O
to O
work O
the O
vessel O
while O
the O
boats O
are O
pursuing O
the O
whale O
. O
As O
a O
general O
thing O
, O
these O
ship-keepers O
are O
as O
hardy O
fellows O
as O
the O
men O
comprising O
the O
boats O
’ O
crews O
. O
But O
if O
there O
happen O
to O
be O
an O
unduly O
slender O
, O
clumsy O
, O
or O
timorous O
wight O
in O
the O
ship O
, O
that O
wight O
is O
certain O
to O
be O
made O
a O
ship-keeper O
. O
It O
was O
so O
in O
the O
Pequod B-MSC
with O
the O
little O
negro O
Pippin B-CHR
by O
nick-name O
, O
Pip B-CHR
by O
abbreviation O
. O
Poor O
Pip B-CHR
! O
ye O
have O
heard O
of O
him O
before O
; O
ye O
must O
remember O
his O
tambourine O
on O
that O
dramatic O
midnight O
, O
so O
gloomy-jolly O
. O
In O
outer O
aspect O
, O
Pip B-CHR
and O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
made O
a O
match O
, O
like O
a O
black O
pony O
and O
a O
white O
one O
, O
of O
equal O
developments O
, O
though O
of O
dissimilar O
colour O
, O
driven O
in O
one O
eccentric O
span O
. O
But O
while O
hapless O
Dough-Boy B-CHR
was O
by O
nature O
dull O
and O
torpid O
in O
his O
intellects O
, O
Pip B-CHR
, O
though O
over O
tender-hearted O
, O
was O
at O
bottom O
very O
bright O
, O
with O
that O
pleasant O
, O
genial O
, O
jolly O
brightness O
peculiar O
to O
his O
tribe O
; O
a O
tribe O
, O
which O
ever O
enjoy O
all O
holidays O
and O
festivities O
with O
finer O
, O
freer O
relish O
than O
any O
other O
race O
. O
For O
blacks O
, O
the O
year O
’ O
s O
calendar O
should O
show O
naught O
but O
three O
hundred O
and O
sixty-five O

. O
Nor O
smile O
so O
, O
while O
I O
write O
that O
this O
little O
black O
was O
brilliant O
, O
for O
even O
blackness O
has O
its O
brilliancy O
; O
behold O
yon O
lustrous O
ebony O
, O
panelled O
in O
king O
’ O
s O
cabinets O
. O
But O
Pip B-CHR
loved O
life O
, O
and O
all O
life O
’ O
s O
peaceable O
securities O
; O
so O
that O
the O
panic-striking O
business O
in O
which O
he O
had O
somehow O
unaccountably O
become O
entrapped O
, O
had O
most O
sadly O
blurred O
his O
brightness O
; O
though O
, O
as O
ere O
long O
will O
be O
seen O
, O
what O
was O
thus O
temporarily O
subdued O
in O
him O
, O
in O
the O
end O
was O
destined O
to O
be O
luridly O
illumined O
by O
strange O
wild O
fires O
, O
that O
fictitiously O
showed O
him O
off O
to O
ten O
times O
the O
natural O
lustre O
with O
which O
in O
his O
native O
Tolland B-LOC
County O
in O
Connecticut B-LOC
, O
he O
had O
once O
enlivened O
many O
a O
fiddler O
’ O
s O
frolic O
on O
the O
green O
; O
and O
at O
melodious O
even-tide O
, O
with O
his O
gay O
ha-ha O
! O
had O
turned O
the O
round O
horizon O
into O
one O
star-belled O
tambourine O
. O
So O
, O
though O
in O
the O
clear O
air O
of O
day O
, O
suspended O
against O
a O
blue-veined O
neck O
, O
the O
pure-watered O
diamond O
drop O
will O
healthful O
glow O
; O
yet O
, O
when O
the O
cunning O
jeweller O
would O
show O
you O
the O
diamond O
in O
its O
most O
impressive O
lustre O
, O
he O
lays O
it O
against O
a O
gloomy O
ground O
, O
and O
then O
lights O
it O
up O
, O
not O
by O
the O
sun O
, O
but O
by O
some O
unnatural O
gases O
. O
Then O
come O
out O
those O
fiery O
effulgences O
, O
infernally O
superb O
; O
then O
the O
evil-blazing O
diamond O
, O
once O
the O
divinest O
symbol O
of O
the O
crystal O
skies O
, O
looks O
like O
some O
crown-jewel O
stolen O
from O
the O
King O
of O
Hell B-LOC
. O
But O
let O
us O
to O
the O
story O
. O
It O
came O
to O
pass O
, O
that O
in O
the O
ambergris O
affair O
Stubb B-CHR
’ O
s O
after-oarsman O
chanced O
so O
to O
sprain O
his O
hand O
, O
as O
for O
a O
time O
to O
become O
quite O
maimed O
; O
and O
, O
temporarily O
, O
Pip B-CHR
was O
put O
into O
his O
place O
. O
The O
first O
time O
Stubb B-CHR
lowered O
with O
him O
, O
Pip B-CHR
evinced O
much O
nervousness O
; O
but O
happily O
, O
for O
that O
time O
, O
escaped O
close O
contact O
with O
the O
whale O
; O
and O
therefore O
came O
off O
not O
altogether O
discreditably O
; O
though O
Stubb B-CHR
observing O
him O
, O
took O
care O
, O
afterwards O
, O
to O
exhort O
him O
to O
cherish O
his O
courageousness O
to O
the O
utmost O
, O
for O
he O
might O
often O
find O
it O
needful O
. O
Now O
upon O
the O
second O
lowering O
, O
the O
boat O
paddled O
upon O
the O
whale O
; O
and O
as O
the O
fish O
received O
the O
darted O
iron O
, O
it O
gave O
its O
customary O
rap O
, O
which O
happened O
, O
in O
this O
instance O
, O
to O
be O
right O
under O
poor O
Pip B-CHR
’ O
s O
seat O
. O
The O
involuntary O
consternation O
of O
the O
moment O
caused O
him O
to O
leap O
, O
paddle O
in O
hand O
, O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
; O
and O
in O
such O
a O
way O
, O
that O
part O
of O
the O
slack O
whale O
line O
coming O
against O
his O
chest O
, O
he O
breasted O
it O
overboard O
with O
him O
, O
so O
as O
to O
become O
entangled O
in O
it O
, O
when O
at O
last O
plumping O
into O
the O
water O
. O
That O
instant O
the O
stricken O
whale O
started O
on O
a O
fierce O
run O
, O
the O
line O
swiftly O
straightened O
; O
and O
presto O
! O
poor O
Pip B-CHR
came O
all O
foaming O
up O
to O
the O
chocks O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
remorselessly O
dragged O
there O
by O
the O
line O
, O
which O
had O
taken O
several O
turns O
around O
his O
chest O
and O
neck O
. O
Tashtego B-CHR
stood O
in O
the O
bows O
. O
He O
was O
full O
of O
the O
fire O
of O
the O
hunt O
. O
He O
hated O
Pip B-CHR
for O
a O
poltroon O
. O
Snatching O
the O
boat-knife O
from O
its O
sheath O
, O
he O
suspended O
its O
sharp O
edge O
over O
the O
line O
, O
and O
turning O
towards O
Stubb B-CHR
, O
exclaimed O
interrogatively O
, O
“ O
Cut O
? O
” O
Meantime O
Pip B-CHR
’ O
s O
blue O
, O
choked O
face O
plainly O
looked O
, O
Do O
, O
for O
God O
’ O
s O
sake O
! O
All O
passed O
in O
a O
flash O
. O
In O
less O
than O
half O
a O
minute O
, O
this O
entire O
thing O
happened O
. O
“ O
Damn O
him O
, O
cut O
! O
” O
roared O
Stubb B-CHR
; O
and O
so O
the O
whale O
was O
lost O
and O
Pip B-CHR
was O
saved O
. O
So O
soon O
as O
he O
recovered O
himself O
, O
the O
poor O
little O
negro O
was O
assailed O
by O
yells O
and O
execrations O
from O
the O
crew O
. O
Tranquilly O
permitting O
these O
irregular O
cursings O
to O
evaporate O
, O
Stubb B-CHR
then O
in O
a O
plain O
, O
business-like O
, O
but O
still O
half O
humorous O
manner O
, O
cursed O
Pip B-CHR
officially O
; O
and O
that O
done O
, O
unofficially O
gave O
him O
much O
wholesome O
advice O
. O
The O
substance O
was O
, O
Never O
jump O
from O
a O
boat O
, O
Pip B-CHR
, O
except—but O
all O
the O
rest O
was O
indefinite O
, O
as O
the O
soundest O
advice O
ever O
is O
. O
Now O
, O
in O
general O
, O
_Stick O
to O
the O
boat_ O
, O
is O
your O
true O
motto O
in O
whaling O
; O
but O
cases O
will O
sometimes O
happen O
when O
_Leap O
from O
the O
boat_ O
, O
is O
still O
better O
. O
Moreover O
, O
as O
if O
perceiving O
at O
last O
that O
if O
he O
should O
give O
undiluted O
conscientious O
advice O
to O
Pip B-CHR
, O
he O
would O
be O
leaving O
him O
too O
wide O
a O
margin O
to O
jump O
in O
for O
the O
future O
; O
Stubb B-CHR
suddenly O
dropped O
all O
advice O
, O
and O
concluded O
with O
a O
peremptory O
command O
, O
“ O
Stick O
to O
the O
boat O
, O
Pip B-CHR
, O
or O
by O
the O
Lord O
, O
I O
won O
’ O
t O
pick O
you O
up O
if O
you O
jump O
; O
mind O
that O
. O
We O
can O
’ O
t O
afford O
to O
lose O
whales O
by O
the O
likes O
of O
you O
; O
a O
whale O
would O
sell O
for O
thirty O
times O
what O
you O
would O
, O
Pip B-CHR
, O
in O
Alabama B-LOC
. O
Bear O
that O
in O
mind O
, O
and O
don O
’ O
t O
jump O
any O
more. O
” O
Hereby O
perhaps O
Stubb B-CHR
indirectly O
hinted O
, O
that O
though O
man O
loved O
his O
fellow O
, O
yet O
man O
is O
a O
money-making O
animal O
, O
which O
propensity O
too O
often O
interferes O
with O
his O
benevolence O
. O
But O
we O
are O
all O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
Gods O
; O
and O
Pip B-CHR
jumped O
again O
. O
It O
was O
under O
very O
similar O
circumstances O
to O
the O
first O
performance O
; O
but O
this O
time O
he O
did O
not O
breast O
out O
the O
line O
; O
and O
hence O
, O
when O
the O
whale O
started O
to O
run O
, O
Pip B-CHR
was O
left O
behind O
on O
the O
sea O
, O
like O
a O
hurried O
traveller O
’ O
s O
trunk O
. O
Alas O
! O
Stubb B-CHR
was O
but O
too O
true O
to O
his O
word O
. O
It O
was O
a O
beautiful O
, O
bounteous O
, O
blue O
day O
; O
the O
spangled O
sea O
calm O
and O
cool O
, O
and O
flatly O
stretching O
away O
, O
all O
round O
, O
to O
the O
horizon O
, O
like O
gold-beater O
’ O
s O
skin O
hammered O
out O
to O
the O
extremest O
. O
Bobbing O
up O
and O
down O
in O
that O
sea O
, O
Pip B-CHR
’ O
s O
ebon O
head O
showed O
like O
a O
head O
of O
cloves O
. O
No O
boat-knife O
was O
lifted O
when O
he O
fell O
so O
rapidly O
astern O
. O
Stubb B-CHR
’ O
s O
inexorable O
back O
was O
turned O
upon O
him O
; O
and O
the O
whale O
was O
winged O
. O
In O
three O
minutes O
, O
a O
whole O
mile O
of O
shoreless O
ocean O
was O
between O
Pip B-CHR
and O
Stubb B-CHR
. O
Out O
from O
the O
centre O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
poor O
Pip B-CHR
turned O
his O
crisp O
, O
curling O
, O
black O
head O
to O
the O
sun O
, O
another O
lonely O
castaway O
, O
though O
the O
loftiest O
and O
the O
brightest O
. O
Now O
, O
in O
calm O
weather O
, O
to O
swim O
in O
the O
open O
ocean O
is O
as O
easy O
to O
the O
practised O
swimmer O
as O
to O
ride O
in O
a O
spring-carriage O
ashore O
. O
But O
the O
awful O
lonesomeness O
is O
intolerable O
. O
The O
intense O
concentration O
of O
self O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
such O
a O
heartless O
immensity O
, O
my O
God B-CHR
! O
who O
can O
tell O
it O
? O
Mark O
, O
how O
when O
sailors O
in O
a O
dead O
calm O
bathe O
in O
the O
open O
sea—mark O
how O
closely O
they O
hug O
their O
ship O
and O
only O
coast O
along O
her O
sides O
. O
But O
had O
Stubb B-CHR
really O
abandoned O
the O
poor O
little O
negro O
to O
his O
fate O
? O
No O
; O
he O
did O
not O
mean O
to O
, O
at O
least O
. O
Because O
there O
were O
two O
boats O
in O
his O
wake O
, O
and O
he O
supposed O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
that O
they O
would O
of O
course O
come O
up O
to O
Pip B-CHR
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
pick O
him O
up O
; O
though O
, O
indeed O
, O
such O
considerations O
towards O
oarsmen O
jeopardized O
through O
their O
own O
