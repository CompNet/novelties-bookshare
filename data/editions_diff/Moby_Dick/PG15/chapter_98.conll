Already O
has O
it O
been O
related O
how O
the O
great O
leviathan O
is O
afar O
off O
descried O
from O
the O
mast-head O
; O
how O
he O
is O
chased O
over O
the O
watery O
moors O
, O
and O
slaughtered O
in O
the O
valleys O
of O
the O
deep O
; O
how O
he O
is O
then O
towed O
alongside O
and O
beheaded O
; O
and O
how O
( O
on O
the O
principle O
which O
entitled O
the O
headsman O
of O
old O
to O
the O
garments O
in O
which O
the O
beheaded O
was O
killed O
) O
his O
great O
padded O
surtout O
becomes O
the O
property O
of O
his O
executioner O
; O
how O
, O
in O
due O
time O
, O
he O
is O
condemned O
to O
the O
pots O
, O
and O
, O
like O
Shadrach O
, O
Meshach O
, O
and O
Abednego O
, O
his O
spermaceti O
, O
oil O
, O
and O
bone O
pass O
unscathed O
through O
the O
fire O
; O
—but O
now O
it O
remains O
to O
conclude O
the O
last O
chapter O
of O
this O
part O
of O
the O
description O
by O
rehearsing—singing O
, O
if O
I O
may—the O
romantic O
proceeding O
of O
decanting O
off O
his O
oil O
into O
the O
casks O
and O
striking O
them O
down O
into O
the O
hold O
, O
where O
once O
again O
leviathan O
returns O
to O
his O
native O
profundities O
, O
sliding O
along O
beneath O
the O
surface O
as O
before O
; O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
never O
more O
to O
rise O
and O
blow O
. O
While O
still O
warm O
, O
the O
oil O
, O
like O
hot O
punch O
, O
is O
received O
into O
the O
six-barrel O
casks O
; O
and O
while O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
ship O
is O
pitching O
and O
rolling O
this O
way O
and O
that O
in O
the O
midnight O
sea O
, O
the O
enormous O
casks O
are O
slewed O
round O
and O
headed O
over O
, O
end O
for O
end O
, O
and O
sometimes O
perilously O
scoot O
across O
the O
slippery O
deck O
, O
like O
so O
many O
land O
slides O
, O
till O
at O
last O
man-handled O
and O
stayed O
in O
their O
course O
; O
and O
all O
round O
the O
hoops O
, O
rap O
, O
rap O
, O
go O
as O
many O
hammers O
as O
can O
play O
upon O
them O
, O
for O
now O
, O
_ex O
officio_ O
, O
every O
sailor O
is O
a O
cooper O
. O
At O
length O
, O
when O
the O
last O
pint O
is O
casked O
, O
and O
all O
is O
cool O
, O
then O
the O
great O
hatchways O
are O
unsealed O
, O
the O
bowels O
of O
the O
ship O
are O
thrown O
open O
, O
and O
down O
go O
the O
casks O
to O
their O
final O
rest O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
This O
done O
, O
the O
hatches O
are O
replaced O
, O
and O
hermetically O
closed O
, O
like O
a O
closet O
walled O
up O
. O
In O
the O
sperm O
fishery O
, O
this O
is O
perhaps O
one O
of O
the O
most O
remarkable O
incidents O
in O
all O
the O
business O
of O
whaling O
. O
One O
day O
the O
planks O
stream O
with O
freshets O
of O
blood O
and O
oil O
; O
on O
the O
sacred O
quarter-deck O
enormous O
masses O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
head O
are O
profanely O
piled O
; O
great O
rusty O
casks O
lie O
about O
, O
as O
in O
a O
brewery O
yard O
; O
the O
smoke O
from O
the O
try-works O
has O
besooted O
all O
the O
bulwarks O
; O
the O
mariners O
go O
about O
suffused O
with O
unctuousness O
; O
the O
entire O
ship O
seems O
great O
leviathan O
himself O
; O
while O
on O
all O
hands O
the O
din O
is O
deafening O
. O
But O
a O
day O
or O
two O
after O
, O
you O
look O
about O
you O
, O
and O
prick O
your O
ears O
in O
this O
self-same O
ship O
; O
and O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
tell-tale O
boats O
and O
try-works O
, O
you O
would O
all O
but O
swear O
you O
trod O
some O
silent O
merchant O
vessel O
, O
with O
a O
most O
scrupulously O
neat O
commander O
. O
The O
unmanufactured O
sperm O
oil O
possesses O
a O
singularly O
cleansing O
virtue O
. O
This O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
decks O
never O
look O
so O
white O
as O
just O
after O
what O
they O
call O
an O
affair O
of O
oil O
. O
Besides O
, O
from O
the O
ashes O
of O
the O
burned O
scraps O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
a O
potent O
ley O
is O
readily O
made O
; O
and O
whenever O
any O
adhesiveness O
from O
the O
back O
of O
the O
whale O
remains O
clinging O
to O
the O
side O
, O
that O
ley O
quickly O
exterminates O
it O
. O
Hands O
go O
diligently O
along O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
with O
buckets O
of O
water O
and O
rags O
restore O
them O
to O
their O
full O
tidiness O
. O
The O
soot O
is O
brushed O
from O
the O
lower O
rigging O
. O
All O
the O
numerous O
implements O
which O
have O
been O
in O
use O
are O
likewise O
faithfully O
cleansed O
and O
put O
away O
. O
The O
great O
hatch O
is O
scrubbed O
and O
placed O
upon O
the O
try-works O
, O
completely O
hiding O
the O
pots O
; O
every O
cask O
is O
out O
of O
sight O
; O
all O
tackles O
are O
coiled O
in O
unseen O
nooks O
; O
and O
when O
by O
the O
combined O
and O
simultaneous O
industry O
of O
almost O
the O
entire O
ship O
's O
company O
, O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
conscientious O
duty O
is O
at O
last O
concluded O
, O
then O
the O
crew O
themselves O
proceed O
to O
their O
own O
ablutions O
; O
shift O
themselves O
from O
top O
to O
toe O
; O
and O
finally O
issue O
to O
the O
immaculate O
deck O
, O
fresh O
and O
all O
aglow O
, O
as O
bridegrooms O
new-leaped O
from O
out O
the O
daintiest O
Holland O
. O
Now O
, O
with O
elated O
step O
, O
they O
pace O
the O
planks O
in O
twos O
and O
threes O
, O
and O
humorously O
discourse O
of O
parlors O
, O
sofas O
, O
carpets O
, O
and O
fine O
cambrics O
; O
propose O
to O
mat O
the O
deck O
; O
think O
of O
having O
hangings O
to O
the O
top O
; O
object O
not O
to O
taking O
tea O
by O
moonlight O
on O
the O
piazza O
of O
the O
forecastle O
. O
To O
hint O
to O
such O
musked O
mariners O
of O
oil O
, O
and O
bone O
, O
and O
blubber O
, O
were O
little O
short O
of O
audacity O
. O
They O
know O
not O
the O
thing O
you O
distantly O
allude O
to O
. O
Away O
, O
and O
bring O
us O
napkins O
! O
But O
mark O
: O
aloft O
there O
, O
at O
the O
three O
mast O
heads O
, O
stand O
three O
men O
intent O
on O
spying O
out O
more O
whales O
, O
which O
, O
if O
caught O
, O
infallibly O
will O
again O
soil O
the O
old O
oaken O
furniture O
, O
and O
drop O
at O
least O
one O
small O
grease-spot O
somewhere O
. O
Yes O
; O
and O
many O
is O
the O
time O
, O
when O
, O
after O
the O
severest O
uninterrupted O
labors O
, O
which O
know O
no O
night O
; O
continuing O
straight O
through O
for O
ninety-six O
hours O
; O
when O
from O
the O
boat O
, O
where O
they O
have O
swelled O
their O
wrists O
with O
all O
day O
rowing O
on O
the O
Line O
, O
—they O
only O
step O
to O
the O
deck O
to O
carry O
vast O
chains O
, O
and O
heave O
the O
heavy O
windlass O
, O
and O
cut O
and O
slash O
, O
yea O
, O
and O
in O
their O
very O
sweatings O
to O
be O
smoked O
and O
burned O
anew O
by O
the O
combined O
fires O
of O
the O
equatorial O
sun O
and O
the O
equatorial O
try-works O
; O
when O
, O
on O
the O
heel O
of O
all O
this O
, O
they O
have O
finally O
bestirred O
themselves O
to O
cleanse O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
make O
a O
spotless O
dairy O
room O
of O
it O
; O
many O
is O
the O
time O
the O
poor O
fellows O
, O
just O
buttoning O
the O
necks O
of O
their O
clean O
frocks O
, O
are O
startled O
by O
the O
cry O
of O
" O
There O
she O
blows O
! O
" O
and O
away O
they O
fly O
to O
fight O
another O
whale O
, O
and O
go O
through O
the O
whole O
weary O
thing O
again O
. O
Oh O
! O
my O
friends O
, O
but O
this O
is O
man-killing O
! O
Yet O
this O
is O
life O
. O
For O
hardly O
have O
we O
mortals O
by O
long O
toilings O
extracted O
from O
this O
world O
's O
vast O
bulk O
its O
small O
but O
valuable O
sperm O
; O
and O
then O
, O
with O
weary O
patience O
, O
cleansed O
ourselves O
from O
its O
defilements O
, O
and O
learned O
to O
live O
here O
in O
clean O
tabernacles O
of O
the O
soul O
; O
hardly O
is O
this O
done O
, O
when—_There O
she O
blows O
! O
_—the O
ghost O
is O
spouted O
up O
, O
and O
away O
we O
sail O
to O
fight O
some O
other O
world O
, O
and O
go O
through O
young O
life O
's O
old O
routine O
again O
. O
Oh O
! O
the O
metempsychosis O
! O
Oh O
! O
Pythagoras O
, O
that O
in O
bright O
Greece O
, O
two O
thousand O
years O
ago O
, O
did O
die O
, O
so O
good O
, O
so O
wise O
, O
so O
mild O
; O
I O
sailed O
with O
thee O
along O
the O
Peruvian O
coast O
last O
voyage—and O
, O
foolish O
as O
I O
am O
, O
taught O
thee O
, O
a O
green O
simple O
boy O
, O
how O
to O
splice O
a O
rope O
! O
