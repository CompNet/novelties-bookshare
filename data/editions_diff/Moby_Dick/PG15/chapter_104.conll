From O
his O
mighty O
bulk O
the O
whale O
affords O
a O
most O
congenial O
theme O
whereon O
to O
enlarge O
, O
amplify O
, O
and O
generally O
expatiate O
. O
Would O
you O
, O
you O
could O
not O
compress O
him O
. O
By O
good O
rights O
he O
should O
only O
be O
treated O
of O
in O
imperial O
folio O
. O
Not O
to O
tell O
over O
again O
his O
furlongs O
from O
spiracle O
to O
tail O
, O
and O
the O
yards O
he O
measures O
about O
the O
waist O
; O
only O
think O
of O
the O
gigantic O
involutions O
of O
his O
intestines O
, O
where O
they O
lie O
in O
him O
like O
great O
cables O
and O
hausers O
coiled O
away O
in O
the O
subterranean O
orlop-deck O
of O
a O
line-of-battle-ship O
. O
Since O
I O
have O
undertaken O
to O
manhandle O
this O
Leviathan O
, O
it O
behoves O
me O
to O
approve O
myself O
omnisciently O
exhaustive O
in O
the O
enterprise O
; O
not O
overlooking O
the O
minutest O
seminal O
germs O
of O
his O
blood O
, O
and O
spinning O
him O
out O
to O
the O
uttermost O
coil O
of O
his O
bowels O
. O
Having O
already O
described O
him O
in O
most O
of O
his O
present O
habitatory O
and O
anatomical O
peculiarities O
, O
it O
now O
remains O
to O
magnify O
him O
in O
an O
archæological O
, O
fossiliferous O
, O
and O
antediluvian O
point O
of O
view O
. O
Applied O
to O
any O
other O
creature O
than O
the O
Leviathan—to O
an O
ant O
or O
a O
flea—such O
portly O
terms O
might O
justly O
be O
deemed O
unwarrantably O
grandiloquent O
. O
But O
when O
Leviathan O
is O
the O
text O
, O
the O
case O
is O
altered O
. O
Fain O
am O
I O
to O
stagger O
to O
this O
emprise O
under O
the O
weightiest O
words O
of O
the O
dictionary O
. O
And O
here O
be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
whenever O
it O
has O
been O
convenient O
to O
consult O
one O
in O
the O
course O
of O
these O
dissertations O
, O
I O
have O
invariably O
used O
a O
huge O
quarto O
edition O
of O
Johnson O
, O
expressly O
purchased O
for O
that O
purpose O
; O
because O
that O
famous O
lexicographer O
's O
uncommon O
personal O
bulk O
more O
fitted O
him O
to O
compile O
a O
lexicon O
to O
be O
used O
by O
a O
whale O
author O
like O
me O
. O
One O
often O
hears O
of O
writers O
that O
rise O
and O
swell O
with O
their O
subject O
, O
though O
it O
may O
seem O
but O
an O
ordinary O
one O
. O
How O
, O
then O
, O
with O
me O
, O
writing O
of O
this O
Leviathan O
? O
Unconsciously O
my O
chirography O
expands O
into O
placard O
capitals O
. O
Give O
me O
a O
condor O
's O
quill O
! O
Give O
me O
Vesuvius O
' O
crater O
for O
an O
inkstand O
! O
Friends O
, O
hold O
my O
arms O
! O
For O
in O
the O
mere O
act O
of O
penning O
my O
thoughts O
of O
this O
Leviathan O
, O
they O
weary O
me O
, O
and O
make O
me O
faint O
with O
their O
out-reaching O
comprehensiveness O
of O
sweep O
, O
as O
if O
to O
include O
the O
whole O
circle O
of O
the O
sciences O
, O
and O
all O
the O
generations O
of O
whales O
, O
and O
men O
, O
and O
mastodons O
, O
past O
, O
present O
, O
and O
to O
come O
, O
with O
all O
the O
revolving O
panoramas O
of O
empire O
on O
earth O
, O
and O
throughout O
the O
whole O
universe O
, O
not O
excluding O
its O
suburbs O
. O
Such O
, O
and O
so O
magnifying O
, O
is O
the O
virtue O
of O
a O
large O
and O
liberal O
theme O
! O
We O
expand O
to O
its O
bulk O
. O
To O
produce O
a O
mighty O
book O
, O
you O
must O
choose O
a O
mighty O
theme O
. O
No O
great O
and O
enduring O
volume O
can O
ever O
be O
written O
on O
the O
flea O
, O
though O
many O
there O
be O
who O
have O
tried O
it O
. O
Ere O
entering O
upon O
the O
subject O
of O
Fossil O
Whales O
, O
I O
present O
my O
credentials O
as O
a O
geologist O
, O
by O
stating O
that O
in O
my O
miscellaneous O
time O
I O
have O
been O
a O
stone-mason O
, O
and O
also O
a O
great O
digger O
of O
ditches O
, O
canals O
and O
wells O
, O
wine-vaults O
, O
cellars O
, O
and O
cisterns O
of O
all O
sorts O
. O
Likewise O
, O
by O
way O
of O
preliminary O
, O
I O
desire O
to O
remind O
the O
reader O
, O
that O
while O
in O
the O
earlier O
geological O
strata O
there O
are O
found O
the O
fossils O
of O
monsters O
now O
almost O
completely O
extinct O
; O
the O
subsequent O
relics O
discovered O
in O
what O
are O
called O
the O
Tertiary O
formations O
seem O
the O
connecting O
, O
or O
at O
any O
rate O
intercepted O
links O
, O
between O
the O
antichronical O
creatures O
, O
and O
those O
whose O
remote O
posterity O
are O
said O
to O
have O
entered O
the O
Ark O
; O
all O
the O
Fossil O
Whales O
hitherto O
discovered O
belong O
to O
the O
Tertiary O
period O
, O
which O
is O
the O
last O
preceding O
the O
superficial O
formations O
. O
And O
though O
none O
of O
them O
precisely O
answer O
to O
any O
known O
species O
of O
the O
present O
time O
, O
they O
are O
yet O
sufficiently O
akin O
to O
them O
in O
general O
respects O
, O
to O
justify O
their O
taking O
rank O
as O
Cetacean O
fossils O
. O
Detached O
broken O
fossils O
of O
pre-adamite O
whales O
, O
fragments O
of O
their O
bones O
and O
skeletons O
, O
have O
within O
thirty O
years O
past O
, O
at O
various O
intervals O
, O
been O
found O
at O
the O
base O
of O
the O
Alps O
, O
in O
Lombardy O
, O
in O
France O
, O
in O
England O
, O
in O
Scotland O
, O
and O
in O
the O
States O
of O
Louisiana O
, O
Mississippi O
, O
and O
Alabama O
. O
Among O
the O
more O
curious O
of O
such O
remains O
is O
part O
of O
a O
skull O
, O
which O
in O
the O
year O
1779 O
was O
disinterred O
in O
the O
Rue O
Dauphiné O
in O
Paris O
, O
a O
short O
street O
opening O
almost O
directly O
upon O
the O
palace O
of O
the O
Tuileries O
; O
and O
bones O
disinterred O
in O
excavating O
the O
great O
docks O
of O
Antwerp O
, O
in O
Napoleon O
's O
time O
. O
Cuvier O
pronounced O
these O
fragments O
to O
have O
belonged O
to O
some O
utterly O
unknown O
Leviathanic O
species O
. O
But O
by O
far O
the O
most O
wonderful O
of O
all O
cetacean O
relics O
was O
the O
almost O
complete O
vast O
skeleton O
of O
an O
extinct O
monster O
, O
found O
in O
the O
year O
1842 O
, O
on O
the O
plantation O
of O
Judge O
Creagh O
, O
in O
Alabama O
. O
The O
awe-stricken O
credulous O
slaves O
in O
the O
vicinity O
took O
it O
for O
the O
bones O
of O
one O
of O
the O
fallen O
angels O
. O
The O
Alabama O
doctors O
declared O
it O
a O
huge O
reptile O
, O
and O
bestowed O
upon O
it O
the O
name O
of O
Basilosaurus O
. O
But O
some O
specimen O
bones O
of O
it O
being O
taken O
across O
the O
sea O
to O
Owen O
, O
the O
English O
Anatomist O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
this O
alleged O
reptile O
was O
a O
whale O
, O
though O
of O
a O
departed O
species O
. O
A O
significant O
illustration O
of O
the O
fact O
, O
again O
and O
again O
repeated O
in O
this O
book O
, O
that O
the O
skeleton O
of O
the O
whale O
furnishes O
but O
little O
clue O
to O
the O
shape O
of O
his O
fully O
invested O
body O
. O
So O
Owen O
rechristened O
the O
monster O
Zeuglodon O
; O
and O
in O
his O
paper O
read O
before O
the O
London O
Geological O
Society O
, O
pronounced O
it O
, O
in O
substance O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
extraordinary O
creatures O
which O
the O
mutations O
of O
the O
globe O
have O
blotted O
out O
of O
existence O
. O
When O
I O
stand O
among O
these O
mighty O
Leviathan O
skeletons O
, O
skulls O
, O
tusks O
, O
jaws O
, O
ribs O
, O
and O
vertebræ O
, O
all O
characterized O
by O
partial O
resemblances O
to O
the O
existing O
breeds O
of O
sea-monsters O
; O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
bearing O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
similar O
affinities O
to O
the O
annihilated O
antichronical O
Leviathans O
, O
their O
incalculable O
seniors O
; O
I O
am O
, O
by O
a O
flood O
, O
borne O
back O
to O
that O
wondrous O
period O
, O
ere O
time O
itself O
can O
be O
said O
to O
have O
begun O
; O
for O
time O
began O
with O
man O
. O
Here O
Saturn O
's O
grey O
chaos O
rolls O
over O
me O
, O
and O
I O
obtain O
dim O
, O
shuddering O
glimpses O
into O
those O
Polar O
eternities O
; O
when O
wedged O
bastions O
of O
ice O
pressed O
hard O
upon O
what O
are O
now O
the O
Tropics O
; O
and O
in O
all O
the O
25,000 O
miles O
of O
this O
world O
's O
circumference O
, O
not O
an O
inhabitable O
hand O
's O
breadth O
of O
land O
was O
visible O
. O
Then O
the O
whole O
world O
was O
the O
whale O
's O
; O
and O
, O
king O
of O
creation O
, O
he O
left O
his O
wake O
along O
the O
present O
lines O
of O
the O
Andes O
and O
the O
Himmalehs O
. O
Who O
can O
show O
a O
pedigree O
like O
Leviathan O
? O
Ahab O
's O
harpoon O
had O
shed O
older O
blood O
than O
the O
Pharaoh O
's O
. O
Methuselah O
seems O
a O
school-boy O
. O
I O
look O
round O
to O
shake O
hands O
with O
Shem O
. O
I O
am O
horror-struck O
at O
this O
antemosaic O
, O
unsourced O
existence O
of O
the O
unspeakable O
terrors O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
which O
, O
having O
been O
before O
all O
time O
, O
must O
needs O
exist O
after O
all O
humane O
ages O
are O
over O
. O
But O
not O
alone O
has O
this O
Leviathan O
left O
his O
pre-adamite O
traces O
in O
the O
stereotype O
plates O
of O
nature O
, O
and O
in O
limestone O
and O
marl O
bequeathed O
his O
ancient O
bust O
; O
but O
upon O
Egyptian O
tablets O
, O
whose O
antiquity O
seems O
to O
claim O
for O
them O
an O
almost O
fossiliferous O
character O
, O
we O
find O
the O
unmistakable O
print O
of O
his O
fin O
. O
In O
an O
apartment O
of O
the O
great O
temple O
of O
Denderah O
, O
some O
fifty O
years O
ago O
, O
there O
was O
discovered O
upon O
the O
granite O
ceiling O
a O
sculptured O
and O
painted O
planisphere O
, O
abounding O
in O
centaurs O
, O
griffins O
, O
and O
dolphins O
, O
similar O
to O
the O
grotesque O
figures O
on O
the O
celestial O
globe O
of O
the O
moderns O
. O
Gliding O
among O
them O
, O
old O
Leviathan O
swam O
as O
of O
yore O
; O
was O
there O
swimming O
in O
that O
planisphere O
, O
centuries O
before O
Solomon O
was O
cradled O
. O
Nor O
must O
there O
be O
omitted O
another O
strange O
attestation O
of O
the O
antiquity O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
in O
his O
own O
osseous O
post-diluvian O
reality O
, O
as O
set O
down O
by O
the O
venerable O
John O
Leo O
, O
the O
old O
Barbary O
traveller O
. O
" O
Not O
far O
from O
the O
Sea-side O
, O
they O
have O
a O
Temple O
, O
the O
Rafters O
and O
Beams O
of O
which O
are O
made O
of O
Whale-Bones O
; O
for O
Whales O
of O
a O
monstrous O
size O
are O
oftentimes O
cast O
up O
dead O
upon O
that O
shore O
. O
The O
Common O
People O
imagine O
, O
that O
by O
a O
secret O
Power O
bestowed O
by O
God O
upon O
the O
Temple O
, O
no O
Whale O
can O
pass O
it O
without O
immediate O
death O
. O
But O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
Matter O
is O
, O
that O
on O
either O
side O
of O
the O
Temple O
, O
there O
are O
Rocks O
that O
shoot O
two O
Miles O
into O
the O
Sea O
, O
and O
wound O
the O
Whales O
when O
they O
light O
upon O
'em O
. O
They O
keep O
a O
Whale O
's O
Rib O
of O
an O
incredible O
length O
for O
a O
Miracle O
, O
which O
lying O
upon O
the O
Ground O
with O
its O
convex O
part O
uppermost O
, O
makes O
an O
Arch O
, O
the O
Head O
of O
which O
can O
not O
be O
reached O
by O
a O
Man O
upon O
a O
Camel O
's O
Back O
. O
This O
Rib O
( O
says O
John O
Leo O
) O
is O
said O
to O
have O
layn O
there O
a O
hundred O
Years O
before O
I O
saw O
it O
. O
Their O
Historians O
affirm O
, O
that O
a O
Prophet O
who O
prophesy O
'd O
of O
Mahomet O
, O
came O
from O
this O
Temple O
, O
and O
some O
do O
not O
stand O
to O
assert O

that O
the O
Prophet O
Jonas O

cast O
forth O
by O
the O
Whale O
at O
