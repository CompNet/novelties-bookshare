Other O
poets O
have O
warbled O
the O
praises O
of O
the O
soft O
eye O
of O
the O
antelope O
, O
and O
the O
lovely O
plumage O
of O
the O
bird O
that O
never O
alights O
; O
less O
celestial O
, O
I O
celebrate O
a O
tail O
. O
Reckoning O
the O
largest O
sized O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
tail O
to O
begin O
at O
that O
point O
of O
the O
trunk O
where O
it O
tapers O
to O
about O
the O
girth O
of O
a O
man O
, O
it O
comprises O
upon O
its O
upper O
surface O
alone O
, O
an O
area O
of O
at O
least O
fifty O
square O
feet O
. O
The O
compact O
round O
body O
of O
its O
root O
expands O
into O
two O
broad O
, O
firm O
, O
flat O
palms O
or O
flukes O
, O
gradually O
shoaling O
away O
to O
less O
than O
an O
inch O
in O
thickness O
. O
At O
the O
crotch O
or O
junction O
, O
these O
flukes O
slightly O
overlap O
, O
then O
sideways O
recede O
from O
each O
other O
like O
wings O
, O
leaving O
a O
wide O
vacancy O
between O
. O
In O
no O
living O
thing O
are O
the O
lines O
of O
beauty O
more O
exquisitely O
defined O
than O
in O
the O
crescentic O
borders O
of O
these O
flukes O
. O
At O
its O
utmost O
expansion O
in O
the O
full O
grown O
whale O
, O
the O
tail O
will O
considerably O
exceed O
twenty O
feet O
across O
. O
The O
entire O
member O
seems O
a O
dense O
webbed O
bed O
of O
welded O
sinews O
; O
but O
cut O
into O
it O
, O
and O
you O
find O
that O
three O
distinct O
strata O
compose O
it O
: O
—upper O
, O
middle O
, O
and O
lower O
. O
The O
fibres O
in O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
layers O
, O
are O
long O
and O
horizontal O
; O
those O
of O
the O
middle O
one O
, O
very O
short O
, O
and O
running O
crosswise O
between O
the O
outside O
layers O
. O
This O
triune O
structure O
, O
as O
much O
as O
anything O
else O
, O
imparts O
power O
to O
the O
tail O
. O
To O
the O
student O
of O
old O
Roman O
walls O
, O
the O
middle O
layer O
will O
furnish O
a O
curious O
parallel O
to O
the O
thin O
course O
of O
tiles O
always O
alternating O
with O
the O
stone O
in O
those O
wonderful O
relics O
of O
the O
antique O
, O
and O
which O
undoubtedly O
contribute O
so O
much O
to O
the O
great O
strength O
of O
the O
masonry O
. O
But O
as O
if O
this O
vast O
local O
power O
in O
the O
tendinous O
tail O
were O
not O
enough O
, O
the O
whole O
bulk O
of O
the O
leviathan O
is O
knit O
over O
with O
a O
warp O
and O
woof O
of O
muscular O
fibres O
and O
filaments O
, O
which O
passing O
on O
either O
side O
the O
loins O
and O
running O
down O
into O
the O
flukes O
, O
insensibly O
blend O
with O
them O
, O
and O
largely O
contribute O
to O
their O
might O
; O
so O
that O
in O
the O
tail O
the O
confluent O
measureless O
force O
of O
the O
whole O
whale O
seems O
concentrated O
to O
a O
point O
. O
Could O
annihilation O
occur O
to O
matter O
, O
this O
were O
the O
thing O
to O
do O
it O
. O
Nor O
does O
this—its O
amazing O
strength O
, O
at O
all O
tend O
to O
cripple O
the O
graceful O
flexion O
of O
its O
motions O
; O
where O
infantileness O
of O
ease O
undulates O
through O
a O
Titanism O
of O
power O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
those O
motions O
derive O
their O
most O
appalling O
beauty O
from O
it O
. O
Real O
strength O
never O
impairs O
beauty O
or O
harmony O
, O
but O
it O
often O
bestows O
it O
; O
and O
in O
everything O
imposingly O
beautiful O
, O
strength O
has O
much O
to O
do O
with O
the O
magic O
. O
Take O
away O
the O
tied O
tendons O
that O
all O
over O
seem O
bursting O
from O
the O
marble O
in O
the O
carved O
Hercules O
, O
and O
its O
charm O
would O
be O
gone O
. O
As O
devout O
Eckerman O
lifted O
the O
linen O
sheet O
from O
the O
naked O
corpse O
of O
Goethe O
, O
he O
was O
overwhelmed O
with O
the O
massive O
chest O
of O
the O
man O
, O
that O
seemed O
as O
a O
Roman O
triumphal O
arch O
. O
When O
Angelo O
paints O
even O
God O
the O
Father O
in O
human O
form O
, O
mark O
what O
robustness O
is O
there O
. O
And O
whatever O
they O
may O
reveal O
of O
the O
divine O
love O
in O
the O
Son O
, O
the O
soft O
, O
curled O
, O
hermaphroditical O
Italian O
pictures O
, O
in O
which O
his O
idea O
has O
been O
most O
successfully O
embodied O
; O
these O
pictures O
, O
so O
destitute O
as O
they O
are O
of O
all O
brawniness O
, O
hint O
nothing O
of O
any O
power O
, O
but O
the O
mere O
negative O
, O
feminine O
one O
of O
submission O
and O
endurance O
, O
which O
on O
all O
hands O
it O
is O
conceded O
, O
form O
the O
peculiar O
practical O
virtues O
of O
his O
teachings O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
subtle O
elasticity O
of O
the O
organ O
I O
treat O
of O
, O
that O
whether O
wielded O
in O
sport O
, O
or O
in O
earnest O
, O
or O
in O
anger O
, O
whatever O
be O
the O
mood O
it O
be O
in O
, O
its O
flexions O
are O
invariably O
marked O
by O
exceeding O
grace O
. O
Therein O
no O
fairy O
's O
arm O
can O
transcend O
it O
. O
Five O
great O
motions O
are O
peculiar O
to O
it O
. O
First O
, O
when O
used O
as O
a O
fin O
for O
progression O
; O
Second O
, O
when O
used O
as O
a O
mace O
in O
battle O
; O
Third O
, O
in O
sweeping O
; O
Fourth O
, O
in O
lobtailing O
; O
Fifth O
, O
in O
peaking O
flukes O
. O
First O
: O
Being O
horizontal O
in O
its O
position O
, O
the O
Leviathan O
's O
tail O
acts O
in O
a O
different O
manner O
from O
the O
tails O
of O
all O
other O
sea O
creatures O
. O
It O
never O
wriggles O
. O
In O
man O
or O
fish O
, O
wriggling O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
inferiority O
. O
To O
the O
whale O
, O
his O
tail O
is O
the O
sole O
means O
of O
propulsion O
. O
Scroll-wise O
coiled O
forwards O
beneath O
the O
body O
, O
and O
then O
rapidly O
sprung O
backwards O
, O
it O
is O
this O
which O
gives O
that O
singular O
darting O
, O
leaping O
motion O
to O
the O
monster O
when O
furiously O
swimming O
. O
His O
side-fins O
only O
serve O
to O
steer O
by O
. O
Second O
: O
It O
is O
a O
little O
significant O
, O
that O
while O
one O
sperm O
whale O
only O
fights O
another O
sperm O
whale O
with O
his O
head O
and O
jaw O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
in O
his O
conflicts O
with O
man O
, O
he O
chiefly O
and O
contemptuously O
uses O
his O
tail O
. O
In O
striking O
at O
a O
boat O
, O
he O
swiftly O
curves O
away O
his O
flukes O
from O
it O
, O
and O
the O
blow O
is O
only O
inflicted O
by O
the O
recoil O
. O
If O
it O
be O
made O
in O
the O
unobstructed O
air O
, O
especially O
if O
it O
descend O
to O
its O
mark O
, O
the O
stroke O
is O
then O
simply O
irresistible O
. O
No O
ribs O
of O
man O
or O
boat O
can O
withstand O
it O
. O
Your O
only O
salvation O
lies O
in O
eluding O
it O
; O
but O
if O
it O
comes O
sideways O
through O
the O
opposing O
water O
, O
then O
partly O
owing O
to O
the O
light O
buoyancy O
of O
the O
whale-boat O
, O
and O
the O
elasticity O
of O
its O
materials O
, O
a O
cracked O
rib O
or O
a O
dashed O
plank O
or O
two O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
stitch O
in O
the O
side O
, O
is O
generally O
the O
most O
serious O
result O
. O
These O
submerged O
side O
blows O
are O
so O
often O
received O
in O
the O
fishery O
, O
that O
they O
are O
accounted O
mere O
child O
's O
play O
. O
Some O
one O
strips O
off O
a O
frock O
, O
and O
the O
hole O
is O
stopped O
. O
Third O
: O
I O
can O
not O
demonstrate O
it O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
, O
that O
in O
the O
whale O
the O
sense O
of O
touch O
is O
concentrated O
in O
the O
tail O
; O
for O
in O
this O
respect O
there O
is O
a O
delicacy O
in O
it O
only O
equalled O
by O
the O
daintiness O
of O
the O
elephant O
's O
trunk O
. O
This O
delicacy O
is O
chiefly O
evinced O
in O
the O
action O
of O
sweeping O
, O
when O
in O
maidenly O
gentleness O
the O
whale O
with O
a O
certain O
soft O
slowness O
moves O
his O
immense O
flukes O
from O
side O
to O
side O
upon O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
if O
he O
feel O
but O
a O
sailor O
's O
whisker O
, O
woe O
to O
that O
sailor O
, O
whiskers O
and O
all O
. O
What O
tenderness O
there O
is O
in O
that O
preliminary O
touch O
! O
Had O
this O
tail O
any O
prehensile O
power O
, O
I O
should O
straightway O
bethink O
me O
of O
Darmonodes O
' O
elephant O
that O
so O
frequented O
the O
flower-market O
, O
and O
with O
low O
salutations O
presented O
nosegays O
to O
damsels O
, O
and O
then O
caressed O
their O
zones O
. O
On O
more O
accounts O
than O
one O
, O
a O
pity O
it O
is O
that O
the O
whale O
does O
not O
possess O
this O
prehensile O
virtue O
in O
his O
tail O
; O
for O
I O
have O
heard O
of O
yet O
another O
elephant O
, O
that O
when O
wounded O
in O
the O
fight O
, O
curved O
round O
his O
trunk O
and O
extracted O
the O
dart O
. O
Fourth O
: O
Stealing O
unawares O
upon O
the O
whale O
in O
the O
fancied O
security O
of O
the O
middle O
of O
solitary O
seas O
, O
you O
find O
him O
unbent O
from O
the O
vast O
corpulence O
of O
his O
dignity O
, O
and O
kitten-like O
, O
he O
plays O
on O
the O
ocean O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
hearth O
. O
But O
still O
you O
see O
his O
power O
in O
his O
play O
. O
The O
broad O
palms O
of O
his O
tail O
are O
flirted O
high O
into O
the O
air O
; O
then O
smiting O
the O
surface O
, O
the O
thunderous O
concussion O
resounds O
for O
miles O
. O
You O
would O
almost O
think O
a O
great O
gun O
had O
been O
discharged O
; O
and O
if O
you O
noticed O
the O
light O
wreath O
of O
vapor O
from O
the O
spiracle O
at O
his O
other O
extremity O
, O
you O
would O
think O
that O
that O
was O
the O
smoke O
from O
the O
touch-hole O
. O
Fifth O
: O
As O
in O
the O
ordinary O
floating O
posture O
of O
the O
leviathan O
the O
flukes O
lie O
considerably O
below O
the O
level O
of O
his O
back O
, O
they O
are O
then O
completely O
out O
of O
sight O
beneath O
the O
surface O
; O
but O
when O
he O
is O
about O
to O
plunge O
into O
the O
deeps O
, O
his O
entire O
flukes O
with O
at O
least O
thirty O
feet O
of O
his O
body O
are O
tossed O
erect O
in O
the O
air O
, O
and O
so O
remain O
vibrating O
a O
moment O
, O
till O
they O
downwards O
shoot O
out O
of O
view O
. O
Excepting O
the O
sublime O
_breach_—somewhere O
else O
to O
be O
described—this O
peaking O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
flukes O
is O
perhaps O
the O
grandest O
sight O
to O
be O
seen O
in O
all O
animated O
nature O
. O
Out O
of O
the O
bottomless O
profundities O
the O
gigantic O
tail O
seems O
spasmodically O
snatching O
at O
the O
highest O
heaven O
. O
So O
in O
dreams O
, O
have O
I O
seen O
majestic O
Satan O
thrusting O
forth O
his O
tormented O
colossal O
claw O
from O
the O
flame O
Baltic O
of O
Hell O
. O
But O
in O
gazing O
at O
such O
scenes O
, O
it O
is O
all O
in O
all O
what O
mood O
you O
are O
in O
; O
if O
in O
the O
Dantean O
, O
the O
devils O
will O
occur O
to O
you O
; O
if O
in O
that O
of O
Isaiah O
, O
the O
archangels O
. O
Standing O
at O
the O
mast-head O
of O
my O
ship O
during O
a O
sunrise O
that O
crimsoned O
sky O
and O
sea O
, O
I O
once O
saw O
a O
large O
herd O
of O
whales O
in O
the O
east O
, O
all O
heading O
towards O
the O
sun O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
vibrating O
in O
concert O
with O
peaked O
flukes O
. O
As O
it O
seemed O
to O
me O
at O
the O
time O
, O
such O
a O
grand O
embodiment O
of O
adoration O
of O
the O
gods O
was O
never O
beheld O
, O
even O
in O
Persia O
, O
the O
home O
of O
the O
fire O
worshippers O
. O
As O
Ptolemy O
Philopater O
testified O
of O
the O
African O
elephant O
, O
I O
then O
testified O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
pronouncing O
him O
the O
most O
devout O
of O
all O
beings O
. O
For O
according O
to O
King O
Juba O
, O
the O
military O
elephants O
of O
antiquity O
often O
hailed O
the O
morning O
with O
their O
trunks O
uplifted O
in O
the O
profoundest O
silence O
. O
The O
chance O
comparison O
in O
this O
chapter O
, O
between O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
elephant O
, O
so O
far O
as O
some O
aspects O
of O
the O
tail O
of O
the O
one O
and O
the O
trunk O
of O
the O
other O
are O
concerned O
, O
should O
not O
tend O
to O
place O
those O
two O
opposite O
organs O
on O
an O
equality O
, O
much O
less O
the O
creatures O
to O
which O
they O
respectively O
belong O
. O
For O
as O
the O
mightiest O
elephant O
is O
but O
a O
terrier O
to O
Leviathan O
, O
so O
, O
compared O
with O
Leviathan O
's O
tail O
, O
his O
trunk O
is O
but O
the O
stalk O
of O
a O
lily O
. O
The O
most O
direful O
blow O
from O
the O
elephant O
's O
trunk O
were O
as O
the O
playful O
tap O
of O
a O
fan O
, O
compared O
with O
the O
measureless O
crush O
and O
crash O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
's O
ponderous O
flukes O
, O
which O
in O
repeated O
instances O
have O
one O
after O
the O
other O
hurled O
entire O
boats O
with O
all O
their O
oars O
and O
crews O
into O
the O
air O
, O
very O
much O
as O
an O
Indian O
juggler O
tosses O
his O
balls O
. O
[ O
18 O
] O
[ O

] O
Though O
all O
comparison O
in O
the O
way O
of O
general O
bulk O
between O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
elephant O
is O
preposterous O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
in O
that O
particular O
the O
elephant O
stands O
in O
much O
the O
same O
respect O
to O
the O
whale O
that O
a O
dog O
does O
to O
the O
elephant O
; O
nevertheless O
, O
there O
are O
not O
wanting O
some O
points O
of O
curious O
similitude O
; O
among O
these O
is O
the O
spout O
. O
It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
the O
elephant O
will O
often O
draw O
up O
water O
or O
dust O
in O
his O
trunk O
, O
and O
then O
elevating O
it O
, O
jet O
it O
forth O
in O
a O
stream O
. O
The O
more O
I O
consider O
this O
mighty O
tail O
, O
the O
more O
do O
I O
deplore O
my O
inability O
to O
express O
it O
. O
At O
times O
there O
are O
gestures O
in O
it O
, O
which O
, O
though O
they O
would O
well O
grace O
the O
hand O
of O
man O
, O
remain O
wholly O
inexplicable O
. O
In O
an O
extensive O
herd O
, O
so O
remarkable O
, O
occasionally O
, O
are O
these O
mystic O
gestures O
, O
that O
I O
have O
heard O
hunters O
who O
have O
declared O
them O
akin O
to O
Free-Mason O
signs O
and O
symbols O
; O
that O
the O
whale O
, O
indeed O
, O
by O
these O
methods O
intelligently O
conversed O
with O
the O
world O
. O
Nor O
are O
there O
wanting O
other O
motions O
of O
the O
whale O
in O
his O
general O
body O
, O
full O
of O
strangeness O
, O
and O
unaccountable O
to O
his O

how O
