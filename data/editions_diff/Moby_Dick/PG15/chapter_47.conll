It O
was O
a O
cloudy O
, O
sultry O
afternoon O
; O
the O
seamen O
were O
lazily O
lounging O
about O
the O
decks O
, O
or O
vacantly O
gazing O
over O
into O
the O
lead-colored O
waters O
. O
Queequeg O
and O
I O
were O
mildly O
employed O
weaving O
what O
is O
called O
a O
sword-mat O
, O
for O
an O
additional O
lashing O
to O
our O
boat O
. O
So O
still O
and O
subdued O
and O
yet O
somehow O
preluding O
was O
all O
the O
scene O
, O
and O
such O
an O
incantation O
of O
revery O
lurked O
in O
the O
air O
, O
that O
each O
silent O
sailor O
seemed O
resolved O
into O
his O
own O
invisible O
self O
. O
I O
was O
the O
attendant O
or O
page O
of O
Queequeg O
, O
while O
busy O
at O
the O
mat O
. O
As O
I O
kept O
passing O
and O
repassing O
the O
filling O
or O
woof O
of O
marline O
between O
the O
long O
yarns O
of O
the O
warp O
, O
using O
my O
own O
hand O
for O
the O
shuttle O
, O
and O
as O
Queequeg O
, O
standing O
sideways O
, O
ever O
and O
anon O
slid O
his O
heavy O
oaken O
sword O
between O
the O
threads O
, O
and O
idly O
looking O
off O
upon O
the O
water O
, O
carelessly O
and O
unthinkingly O
drove O
home O
every O
yarn O
: O
I O
say O
so O
strange O
a O
dreaminess O
did O
there O
then O
reign O
all O
over O
the O
ship O
and O
all O
over O
the O
sea O
, O
only O
broken O
by O
the O
intermitting O
dull O
sound O
of O
the O
sword O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
this O
were O
the O
Loom O
of O
Time O
, O
and O
I O
myself O
were O
a O
shuttle O
mechanically O
weaving O
and O
weaving O
away O
at O
the O
Fates O
. O
There O
lay O
the O
fixed O
threads O
of O
the O
warp O
subject O
to O
but O
one O
single O
, O
ever O
returning O
, O
unchanging O
vibration O
, O
and O
that O
vibration O
merely O
enough O
to O
admit O
of O
the O
crosswise O
interblending O
of O
other O
threads O
with O
its O
own O
. O
This O
warp O
seemed O
necessity O
; O
and O
here O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
with O
my O
own O
hand O
I O
ply O
my O
own O
shuttle O
and O
weave O
my O
own O
destiny O
into O
these O
unalterable O
threads O
. O
Meantime O
, O
Queequeg O
's O
impulsive O
, O
indifferent O
sword O
, O
sometimes O
hitting O
the O
woof O
slantingly O
, O
or O
crookedly O
, O
or O
strongly O
, O
or O
weakly O
, O
as O
the O
case O
might O
be O
; O
and O
by O
this O
difference O
in O
the O
concluding O
blow O
producing O
a O
corresponding O
contrast O
in O
the O
final O
aspect O
of O
the O
completed O
fabric O
; O
this O
savage O
's O
sword O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
which O
thus O
finally O
shapes O
and O
fashions O
both O
warp O
and O
woof O
; O
this O
easy O
, O
indifferent O
sword O
must O
be O
chance—aye O
, O
chance O
, O
free O
will O
, O
and O
necessity—no O
wise O
incompatible—all O
interweavingly O
working O
together O
. O
The O
straight O
warp O
of O
necessity O
, O
not O
to O
be O
swerved O
from O
its O
ultimate O
course—its O
every O
alternating O
vibration O
, O
indeed O
, O
only O
tending O
to O
that O
; O
free O
will O
still O
free O
to O
ply O
her O
shuttle O
between O
given O
threads O
; O
and O
chance O
, O
though O
restrained O
in O
its O
play O
within O
the O
right O
lines O
of O
necessity O
, O
and O
sideways O
in O
its O
motions O
directed O
by O
free O
will O
, O
though O
thus O
prescribed O
to O
by O
both O
, O
chance O
by O
turns O
rules O
either O
, O
and O
has O
the O
last O
featuring O
blow O
at O
events O
. O
* O
* O
* O
* O

Thus O
we O
were O
weaving O
and O
weaving O
away O
when O
I O
started O
at O
a O
sound O
so O
strange O
, O
long O
drawn O
, O
and O
musically O
wild O
and O
unearthly O
, O
that O
the O
ball O
of O
free O
will O
dropped O
from O
my O
hand O
, O
and O
I O
stood O
gazing O
up O
at O
the O
clouds O
whence O
that O
voice O
dropped O
like O
a O
wing O
. O
High O
aloft O
in O
the O
cross-trees O
was O
that O
mad O
Gay-Header O
, O
Tashtego O
. O
His O
body O
was O
reaching O
eagerly O
forward O
, O
his O
hand O
stretched O
out O
like O
a O
wand O
, O
and O
at O
brief O
sudden O
intervals O
he O
continued O
his O
cries O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
the O
same O
sound O
was O
that O
very O
moment O
perhaps O
being O
heard O
all O
over O
the O
seas O
, O
from O
hundreds O
of O
whalemen O
's O
look-outs O
perched O
as O
high O
in O
the O
air O
; O
but O
from O
few O
of O
those O
lungs O
could O
that O
accustomed O
old O
cry O
have O
derived O
such O
a O
marvellous O
cadence O
as O
from O
Tashtego O
the O
Indian O
's O
. O
As O
he O
stood O
hovering O
over O
you O
half O
suspended O
in O
air O
, O
so O
wildly O
and O
eagerly O
peering O
towards O
the O
horizon O
, O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
him O
some O
prophet O
or O
seer O
beholding O
the O
shadows O
of O
Fate O
, O
and O
by O
those O
wild O
cries O
announcing O
their O
coming O
. O
" O
There O
she O
blows O
! O
there O
! O
there O
! O
there O
! O
she O
blows O
! O
she O
blows O
! O
" O
" O
Where-away O
? O
" O
" O
On O
the O
lee-beam O
, O
about O
two O
miles O
off O
! O
a O
school O
of O
them O
! O
" O
Instantly O
all O
was O
commotion O
. O
The O
Sperm O
Whale O
blows O
as O
a O
clock O
ticks O
, O
with O
the O
same O
undeviating O
and O
reliable O
uniformity O
. O
And O
thereby O
whalemen O
distinguish O
this O
fish O
from O
other O
tribes O
of O
his O
genus O
. O
" O
There O
go O
flukes O
! O
" O
was O
now O
the O
cry O
from O
Tashtego O
; O
and O
the O
whales O
disappeared O
. O
" O
Quick O
, O
steward O
! O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
. O
" O
Time O
! O
time O
! O
" O
Dough-Boy O
hurried O
below O
, O
glanced O
at O
the O
watch O
, O
and O
reported O
the O
exact O
minute O
to O
Ahab O
. O
The O
ship O
was O
now O
kept O
away O
from O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
she O
went O
gently O
rolling O
before O
it O
. O
Tashtego O
reporting O
that O
the O
whales O
had O
gone O
down O
heading O
to O
leeward O
, O
we O
confidently O
looked O
to O
see O
them O
again O
directly O
in O
advance O
of O
our O
bows O
. O
For O
that O
singular O
craft O
at O
times O
evinced O
by O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
when O
, O
sounding O
with O
his O
head O
in O
one O
direction O
, O
he O
nevertheless O
, O
while O
concealed O
beneath O
the O
surface O
, O
mills O
round O
, O
and O
swiftly O
swims O
off O
in O
the O
opposite O
quarter—this O
deceitfulness O
of O
his O
could O
not O
now O
be O
in O
action O
; O
for O
there O
was O
no O
reason O
to O
suppose O
that O
the O
fish O
seen O
by O
Tashtego O
had O
been O
in O
any O
way O
alarmed O
, O
or O
indeed O
knew O
at O
all O
of O
our O
vicinity O
. O
One O
of O
the O
men O
selected O
for O
shipkeepers—that O
is O
, O
those O
not O
appointed O
to O
the O
boats O
, O
by O
this O
time O
relieved O
the O
Indian O
at O
the O
main-mast O
head O
. O
The O
sailors O
at O
the O
fore O
and O
mizzen O
had O
come O
down O
; O
the O
line O
tubs O
were O
fixed O
in O
their O
places O
; O
the O
cranes O
were O
thrust O
out O
; O
the O
mainyard O
was O
backed O
, O
and O
the O
three O
boats O
swung O
over O
the O
sea O
like O
three O
samphire O
baskets O
over O
high O
cliffs O
. O
Outside O
of O
the O
bulwarks O
their O
eager O
crews O
with O
one O
hand O
clung O
to O
the O
rail O
, O
while O
one O
foot O
was O
expectantly O
poised O
on O
the O
gunwale O
. O
So O
look O
the O
long O
line O
of O
man-of-war O
's O
men O
about O
to O
throw O
themselves O
on O
board O
an O
enemy O
's O
ship O
. O
But O
at O
this O
critical O
instant O
a O
sudden O
exclamation O
was O
heard O
that O
took O
every O
eye O
from O
the O
whale O
. O
With O
a O
start O
all O
glared O
at O
dark O
Ahab O
, O
who O
was O
surrounded O
by O
five O
dusky O
phantoms O
that O
seemed O
fresh O
formed O
out O
of O
air O
. O
