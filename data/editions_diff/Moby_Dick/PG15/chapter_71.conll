Hand O
in O
hand O
, O
ship O
and O
breeze O
blew O
on O
; O
but O
the O
breeze O
came O
faster O
than O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
soon O
the O
Pequod O
began O
to O
rock O
. O
By O
and O
by O
, O
through O
the O
glass O
the O
stranger O
's O
boats O
and O
manned O
mast-heads O
proved O
her O
a O
whale-ship O
. O
But O
as O
she O
was O
so O
far O
to O
windward O
, O
and O
shooting O
by O
, O
apparently O
making O
a O
passage O
to O
some O
other O
ground O
, O
the O
Pequod O
could O
not O
hope O
to O
reach O
her O
. O
So O
the O
signal O
was O
set O
to O
see O
what O
response O
would O
be O
made O
. O
Here O
be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
like O
the O
vessels O
of O
military O
marines O
, O
the O
ships O
of O
the O
American O
Whale O
Fleet O
have O
each O
a O
private O
signal O
; O
all O
which O
signals O
being O
collected O
in O
a O
book O
with O
the O
names O
of O
the O
respective O
vessels O
attached O
, O
every O
captain O
is O
provided O
with O
it O
. O
Thereby O
, O
the O
whale O
commanders O
are O
enabled O
to O
recognise O
each O
other O
upon O
the O
ocean O
, O
even O
at O
considerable O
distances O
, O
and O
with O
no O
small O
facility O
. O
The O
Pequod O
's O
signal O
was O
at O
last O
responded O
to O
by O
the O
stranger O
's O
setting O
her O
own O
; O
which O
proved O
the O
ship O
to O
be O
the O
Jeroboam O
of O
Nantucket O
. O
Squaring O
her O
yards O
, O
she O
bore O
down O
, O
ranged O
abeam O
under O
the O
Pequod O
's O
lee O
, O
and O
lowered O
a O
boat O
; O
it O
soon O
drew O
nigh O
; O
but O
, O
as O
the O
side-ladder O
was O
being O
rigged O
by O
Starbuck O
's O
order O
to O
accommodate O
the O
visiting O
captain O
, O
the O
stranger O
in O
question O
waved O
his O
hand O
from O
his O
boat O
's O
stern O
in O
token O
of O
that O
proceeding O
being O
entirely O
unnecessary O
. O
It O
turned O
out O
that O
the O
Jeroboam O
had O
a O
malignant O
epidemic O
on O
board O
, O
and O
that O
Mayhew O
, O
her O
captain O
, O
was O
fearful O
of O
infecting O
the O
Pequod O
's O
company O
. O
For O
, O
though O
himself O
and O
boat O
's O
crew O
remained O
untainted O
, O
and O
though O
his O
ship O
was O
half O
a O
rifle-shot O
off O
, O
and O
an O
incorruptible O
sea O
and O
air O
rolling O
and O
flowing O
between O
; O
yet O
conscientiously O
adhering O
to O
the O
timid O
quarantine O
of O
the O
land O
, O
he O
peremptorily O
refused O
to O
come O
into O
direct O
contact O
with O
the O
Pequod O
. O
But O
this O
did O
by O
no O
means O
prevent O
all O
communication O
. O
Preserving O
an O
interval O
of O
some O
few O
yards O
between O
itself O
and O
the O
ship O
, O
the O
Jeroboam O
's O
boat O
by O
the O
occasional O
use O
of O
its O
oars O
contrived O
to O
keep O
parallel O
to O
the O
Pequod O
, O
as O
she O
heavily O
forged O
through O
the O
sea O
( O
for O
by O
this O
time O
it O
blew O
very O
fresh O
) O
, O
with O
her O
main-topsail O
aback O
; O
though O
, O
indeed O
, O
at O
times O
by O
the O
sudden O
onset O
of O
a O
large O
rolling O
wave O
, O
the O
boat O
would O
be O
pushed O
some O
way O
ahead O
; O
but O
would O
be O
soon O
skilfully O
brought O
to O
her O
proper O
bearings O
again O
. O
Subject O
to O
this O
, O
and O
other O
the O
like O
interruptions O
now O
and O
then O
, O
a O
conversation O
was O
sustained O
between O
the O
two O
parties O
; O
but O
at O
intervals O
not O
without O
still O
another O
interruption O
of O
a O
very O
different O
sort O
. O
Pulling O
an O
oar O
in O
the O
Jeroboam O
's O
boat O
, O
was O
a O
man O
of O
a O
singular O
appearance O
, O
even O
in O
that O
wild O
whaling O
life O
where O
individual O
notabilities O
make O
up O
all O
totalities O
. O
He O
was O
a O
small O
, O
short O
, O
youngish O
man O
, O
sprinkled O
all O
over O
his O
face O
with O
freckles O
, O
and O
wearing O
redundant O
yellow O
hair O
. O
A O
long-skirted O
, O
cabalistically-cut O
coat O
of O
a O
faded O
walnut O
tinge O
enveloped O
him O
; O
the O
overlapping O
sleeves O
of O
which O
were O
rolled O
up O
on O
his O
wrists O
. O
A O
deep O
, O
settled O
, O
fanatic O
delirium O
was O
in O
his O
eyes O
. O
So O
soon O
as O
this O
figure O
had O
been O
first O
descried O
, O
Stubb O
had O
exclaimed— O
" O
That O
's O
he O
! O
that O
's O
he O
! O
—the O
long-togged O
scaramouch O
the O
Town-Ho O
's O
company O
told O
us O
of O
! O
" O
Stubb O
here O
alluded O
to O
a O
strange O
story O
told O
of O
the O
Jeroboam O
, O
and O
a O
certain O
man O
among O
her O
crew O
, O
some O
time O
previous O
when O
the O
Pequod O
spoke O
the O
Town-Ho O
. O
According O
to O
this O
account O
and O
what O
was O
subsequently O
learned O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
the O
scaramouch O
in O
question O
had O
gained O
a O
wonderful O
ascendency O
over O
almost O
everybody O
in O
the O
Jeroboam O
. O
His O
story O
was O
this O
: O
He O
had O
been O
originally O
nurtured O
among O
the O
crazy O
society O
of O
Neskyeuna O
Shakers O
, O
where O
he O
had O
been O
a O
great O
prophet O
; O
in O
their O
cracked O
, O
secret O
meetings O
having O
several O
times O
descended O
from O
heaven O
by O
the O
way O
of O
a O
trap-door O
, O
announcing O
the O
speedy O
opening O
of O
the O
seventh O
vial O
, O
which O
he O
carried O
in O
his O
vest-pocket O
; O
but O
, O
which O
, O
instead O
of O
containing O
gunpowder O
, O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
charged O
with O
laudanum O
. O
A O
strange O
, O
apostolic O
whim O
having O
seized O
him O
, O
he O
had O
left O
Neskyeuna O
for O
Nantucket O
, O
where O
, O
with O
that O
cunning O
peculiar O
to O
craziness O
, O
he O
assumed O
a O
steady O
, O
common O
sense O
exterior O
, O
and O
offered O
himself O
as O
a O
green-hand O
candidate O
for O
the O
Jeroboam O
's O
whaling O
voyage O
. O
They O
engaged O
him O
; O
but O
straightway O
upon O
the O
ship O
's O
getting O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
, O
his O
insanity O
broke O
out O
in O
a O
freshet O
. O
He O
announced O
himself O
as O
the O
archangel O
Gabriel O
, O
and O
commanded O
the O
captain O
to O
jump O
overboard O
. O
He O
published O
his O
manifesto O
, O
whereby O
he O
set O
himself O
forth O
as O
the O
deliverer O
of O
the O
isles O
of O
the O
sea O
and O
vicar-general O
of O
all O
Oceanica O
. O
The O
unflinching O
earnestness O
with O
which O
he O
declared O
these O
things O
; O
—the O
dark O
, O
daring O
play O
of O
his O
sleepless O
, O
excited O
imagination O
, O
and O
all O
the O
preternatural O
terrors O
of O
real O
delirium O
, O
united O
to O
invest O
this O
Gabriel O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
ignorant O
crew O
, O
with O
an O
atmosphere O
of O
sacredness O
. O
Moreover O
, O
they O
were O
afraid O
of O
him O
. O
As O
such O
a O
man O
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
of O
much O
practical O
use O
in O
the O
ship O
, O
especially O
as O
he O
refused O
to O
work O
except O
when O
he O
pleased O
, O
the O
incredulous O
captain O
would O
fain O
have O
been O
rid O
of O
him O
; O
but O
apprised O
that O
that O
individual O
's O
intention O
was O
to O
land O
him O
in O
the O
first O
convenient O
port O
, O
the O
archangel O
forthwith O
opened O
all O
his O
seals O
and O
vials—devoting O
the O
ship O
and O
all O
hands O
to O
unconditional O
perdition O
, O
in O
case O
this O
intention O
was O
carried O
out O
. O
So O
strongly O
did O
he O
work O
upon O
his O
disciples O
among O
the O
crew O
, O
that O
at O
last O
in O
a O
body O
they O
went O
to O
the O
captain O
and O
told O
him O
if O
Gabriel O
was O
sent O
from O
the O
ship O
, O
not O
a O
man O
of O
them O
would O
remain O
. O
He O
was O
therefore O
forced O
to O
relinquish O
his O
plan O
. O
Nor O
would O
they O
permit O
Gabriel O
to O
be O
any O
way O
maltreated O
, O
say O
or O
do O
what O
he O
would O
; O
so O
that O
it O
came O
to O
pass O
that O
Gabriel O
had O
the O
complete O
freedom O
of O
the O
ship O
. O
The O
consequence O
of O
all O
this O
was O
, O
that O
the O
archangel O
cared O
little O
or O
nothing O
for O
the O
captain O
and O
mates O
; O
and O
since O
the O
epidemic O
had O
broken O
out O
, O
he O
carried O
a O
higher O
hand O
than O
ever O
; O
declaring O
that O
the O
plague O
, O
as O
he O
called O
it O
, O
was O
at O
his O
sole O
command O
; O
nor O
should O
it O
be O
stayed O
but O
according O
to O
his O
good O
pleasure O
. O
The O
sailors O
, O
mostly O
poor O
devils O
, O
cringed O
, O
and O
some O
of O
them O
fawned O
before O
him O
; O
in O
obedience O
to O
his O
instructions O
, O
sometimes O
rendering O
him O
personal O
homage O
, O
as O
to O
a O
god O
. O
Such O
things O
may O
seem O
incredible O
; O
but O
, O
however O
wondrous O
, O
they O
are O
true O
. O
Nor O
is O
the O
history O
of O
fanatics O
half O
so O
striking O
in O
respect O
to O
the O
measureless O
self-deception O
of O
the O
fanatic O
himself O
, O
as O
his O
measureless O
power O
of O
deceiving O
and O
bedevilling O
so O
many O
others O
. O
But O
it O
is O
time O
to O
return O
to O
the O
Pequod O
. O
" O
I O
fear O
not O
thy O
epidemic O
, O
man O
, O
" O
said O
Ahab O
from O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
to O
Captain O
Mayhew O
, O
who O
stood O
in O
the O
boat O
's O
stern O
; O
" O
come O
on O
board O
. O
" O
But O
now O
Gabriel O
started O
to O
his O
feet O
. O
" O
Think O
, O
think O
of O
the O
fevers O
, O
yellow O
and O
bilious O
! O
Beware O
of O
the O
horrible O
plague O
! O
" O
" O
Gabriel O
, O
Gabriel O
! O
" O
cried O
Captain O
Mayhew O
; O
" O
thou O
must O
either— O
" O
But O
that O
instant O
a O
headlong O
wave O
shot O
the O
boat O
far O
ahead O
, O
and O
its O
seethings O
drowned O
all O
speech O
. O
" O
Hast O
thou O
seen O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
demanded O
Ahab O
, O
when O
the O
boat O
drifted O
back O
. O
" O
Think O
, O
think O
of O
thy O
whale-boat O
, O
stoven O
and O
sunk O
! O
Beware O
of O
the O
horrible O
tail O
! O
" O
" O
I O
tell O
thee O
again O
, O
Gabriel O
, O
that— O
" O
But O
again O
the O
boat O
tore O
ahead O
as O
if O
dragged O
by O
fiends O
. O
Nothing O
was O
said O
for O
some O
moments O
, O
while O
a O
succession O
of O
riotous O
waves O
rolled O
by O
, O
which O
by O
one O
of O
those O
occasional O
caprices O
of O
the O
seas O
were O
tumbling O
, O
not O
heaving O
it O
. O
Meantime O
, O
the O
hoisted O
sperm O
whale O
's O
head O
jogged O
about O
very O
violently O
, O
and O
Gabriel O
was O
seen O
eyeing O
it O
with O
rather O
more O
apprehensiveness O
than O
his O
archangel O
nature O
seemed O
to O
warrant O
. O
When O
this O
interlude O
was O
over O
, O
Captain O
Mayhew O
began O
a O
dark O
story O
concerning O
Moby O
Dick O
; O
not O
, O
however O
, O
without O
frequent O
interruptions O
from O
Gabriel O
, O
whenever O
his O
name O
was O
mentioned O
, O
and O
the O
crazy O
sea O
that O
seemed O
leagued O
with O
him O
. O
It O
seemed O
that O
the O
Jeroboam O
had O
not O
long O
left O
home O
, O
when O
upon O
speaking O
a O
whale-ship O
, O
her O
people O
were O
reliably O
apprised O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
Moby O
Dick O
, O
and O
the O
havoc O
he O
had O
made O
. O
Greedily O
sucking O
in O
this O
intelligence O
, O
Gabriel O
solemnly O
warned O
the O
captain O
against O
attacking O
the O
White O
Whale O
, O
in O
case O
the O
monster O
should O
be O
seen O
; O
in O
his O
gibbering O
insanity O
, O
pronouncing O
the O
White O
Whale O
to O
be O
no O
less O
a O
being O
than O
the O
Shaker O
God O
incarnated O
; O
the O
Shakers O
receiving O
the O
Bible O
. O
But O
when O
, O
some O
year O
or O
two O
afterwards O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
was O
fairly O
sighted O
from O
the O
mast-heads O
, O
Macey O
, O
the O
chief O
mate O
, O
burned O
with O
ardor O
to O
encounter O
him O
; O
and O
the O
captain O
himself O
being O
not O
unwilling O
to O
let O
him O
have O
the O
opportunity O
, O
despite O
all O
the O
archangel O
's O
denunciations O
and O
forewarnings O
, O
Macey O
succeeded O
in O
persuading O
five O
men O
to O
man O
his O
boat O
. O
With O
them O
he O
pushed O
off O
; O
and O
, O
after O
much O
weary O
pulling O
, O
and O
many O
perilous O
, O
unsuccessful O
onsets O
, O
he O
at O
last O
succeeded O
in O
getting O
one O
iron O
fast O
. O
Meantime O
, O
Gabriel O
, O
ascending O
to O
the O
main-royal O
mast-head O
, O
was O
tossing O
one O
arm O
in O
frantic O
gestures O
, O
and O
hurling O
forth O
prophecies O
of O
speedy O
doom O
to O
the O
sacrilegious O
assailants O
of O
his O
divinity O
. O
Now O
, O
while O
Macey O
, O
the O
mate O
, O
was O
standing O
up O
in O
his O
boat O
's O
bow O
, O
and O
with O
all O
the O
reckless O
energy O
of O
his O
tribe O
was O
venting O
his O
wild O
exclamations O
upon O
the O
whale O
, O
and O
essaying O
to O
get O
a O
fair O
chance O
for O
his O
poised O
lance O
, O
lo O
! O
a O
broad O
white O
shadow O
rose O
from O
the O
sea O
; O
by O
its O
quick O
, O
fanning O
motion O
, O
temporarily O
taking O
the O
breath O
out O
of O
the O
bodies O
of O
the O
oarsmen O
. O
Next O
instant O
, O
the O
luckless O
mate O
, O
so O
full O
of O
furious O
life O
, O
was O
smitten O
bodily O
into O
the O
air O
, O
and O
making O
a O
long O
arc O
in O
his O
descent O
, O
fell O
into O
the O
sea O
at O
the O
distance O
of O
about O
fifty O
yards O
. O
Not O
a O
chip O
of O
the O
boat O
was O
harmed O
, O
nor O
a O
hair O
of O
any O
oarsman O
's O
head O
; O
but O
the O
mate O
for O
ever O
sank O
. O
It O
is O
well O
to O
parenthesize O
here O
, O
that O
of O
the O
fatal O
accidents O
in O
the O
Sperm-Whale O
Fishery O
, O
this O
kind O
is O
perhaps O
almost O
as O
frequent O
as O
any O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
nothing O
is O
injured O
but O
the O
man O
who O
is O
thus O
annihilated O
; O
oftener O
the O
boat O
's O
bow O
is O
knocked O
off O
, O
or O
the O
thigh-board O
, O
in O
which O
the O
headsman O
stands O
, O
is O
torn O
from O
its O
place O
and O
accompanies O
the O
body O
. O
But O
strangest O
of O
all O
is O
the O
circumstance O
, O
that O
in O
more O
instances O
than O
one O
, O
when O
the O
body O
has O
been O
recovered O
, O
not O
a O
single O
mark O
of O
violence O
is O
discernible O
; O
the O
man O
being O
stark O
dead O
. O
The O
whole O
calamity O
, O
with O
the O
falling O
form O
of O
Macey O
, O
was O
plainly O
descried O
from O
the O
ship O
. O
Raising O
a O
piercing O
shriek— O
" O
The O
vial O
! O
the O
vial O
! O
" O
Gabriel O
called O
off O
the O
terror-stricken O
crew O
from O
the O
further O
hunting O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
This O
terrible O
event O
clothed O
the O
archangel O
with O
added O
influence O
; O
because O
his O
credulous O
disciples O
believed O
that O
he O
had O
specifically O
fore-announced O
it O
, O
instead O
of O
only O
making O
a O
general O
prophecy O
, O
which O
any O
one O
might O
have O
done O
, O
and O
so O
have O
chanced O
to O
hit O
one O
of O
many O
marks O
in O
the O
wide O
margin O
allowed O
. O
He O
became O
a O
nameless O
terror O
to O
the O
ship O
. O
Mayhew O
having O
concluded O
his O
narration O
, O
Ahab O
put O
such O
questions O
to O
him O
, O
that O
the O
stranger O
captain O
could O
not O
forbear O
inquiring O
whether O
he O
intended O
to O
hunt O
the O
White O
Whale O
, O
if O
opportunity O
should O
offer O
. O
To O
which O
Ahab O
answered— O
" O
Aye O
. O
" O
Straightway O
, O
then O
, O
Gabriel O
once O
more O
started O
to O
his O
feet O
, O
glaring O
upon O
the O
old O
man O
, O
and O
vehemently O
exclaimed O
, O
with O
downward O
pointed O
finger— O
" O
Think O
, O
think O
of O
the O
blasphemer—dead O
, O
and O
down O
there O
! O
—beware O
of O
the O
blasphemer O
's O
end O
! O
" O
Ahab O
stolidly O
turned O
aside O
; O
then O
said O
to O
Mayhew O
, O
" O
Captain O
, O
I O
have O
just O
bethought O
me O
of O
my O
letter-bag O
; O
there O
is O
a O
letter O
for O
one O
of O
thy O
officers O
, O
if O
I O
mistake O
not O
. O
Starbuck O
, O
look O
over O
the O
bag O
. O
" O
Every O
whale-ship O
takes O
out O
a O
goodly O
number O
of O
letters O
for O
various O
ships O
, O
whose O
delivery O
to O
the O
persons O
to O
whom O
they O
may O
be O
addressed O
, O
depends O
upon O
the O
mere O
chance O
of O
encountering O
them O
in O
the O
four O
oceans O
. O
Thus O
, O
most O
letters O
never O
reach O
their O
mark O
; O
and O
many O
are O
only O
received O
after O
attaining O
an O
age O
of O
two O
or O
three O
years O
or O
more O
. O
Soon O
Starbuck O
returned O
with O
a O
letter O
in O
his O
hand O
. O
It O
was O
sorely O
tumbled O
, O
damp O
, O
and O
covered O
with O
a O
dull O
, O
spotted O
, O
green O
mould O
, O
in O
consequence O
of O
being O
kept O
in O
a O
dark O
locker O
of O
the O
cabin O
. O
Of O
such O
a O
letter O
, O
Death O
himself O
might O
well O
have O
been O
the O
post-boy O
. O
" O
Can'st O
not O
read O
it O
? O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
. O
" O
Give O
it O
me O
, O
man O
. O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
it O
's O
but O
a O
dim O
scrawl O
; O
—what O
's O
this O
? O
" O
As O
he O
was O
studying O
it O
out O
, O
Starbuck O
took O
a O
long O
cutting-spade O
pole O
, O
and O
with O
his O
knife O
slightly O
split O
the O
end O
, O
to O
insert O
the O
letter O
there O
, O
and O
in O
that O
way O
, O
hand O
it O
to O
the O
boat O
, O
without O
its O
coming O
any O
closer O
to O
the O
ship O
. O
Meantime O
, O
Ahab O
holding O
the O
letter O
, O
muttered O
, O
" O
Mr. O
Har—yes O
, O
Mr. O
Harry— O
( O
a O
woman O
's O
pinny O
hand O
, O
—the O
man O
's O
wife O
, O
I O
'll O
wager O
) O
—Aye—Mr O
. O
Harry O
Macey O
, O
Ship O
Jeroboam O
; O
—why O
it O
's O
Macey O
, O
and O
he O
's O
dead O
! O
" O
" O
Poor O
fellow O
! O
poor O
fellow O
! O
and O
from O
his O
wife O
, O
" O
sighed O
Mayhew O
; O
" O
but O
let O
me O
have O
it O
. O
" O
" O
Nay O
, O
keep O
it O
thyself O
, O
" O
cried O
Gabriel O
to O
Ahab O
; O
" O
thou O
art O
soon O
going O
that O
way O
. O
" O
" O
Curses O
throttle O
thee O
! O
" O
yelled O
Ahab O
. O
" O
Captain O
Mayhew O
, O
stand O
by O
now O
to O
receive O
it O
; O
" O
and O
taking O
the O
fatal O
missive O
from O
Starbuck O
's O
hands O
, O
he O
caught O
it O
in O
the O
slit O
of O
the O
pole O
, O
and O
reached O
it O
over O
towards O
the O
boat O
. O
But O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O
the O
oarsmen O
expectantly O
desisted O
from O
rowing O
; O
the O
boat O
drifted O
a O
little O
towards O
the O
ship O
's O
stern O
; O
so O
that O
, O
as O
if O
by O
magic O
, O
the O
letter O
suddenly O
ranged O
along O
with O
Gabriel O
's O
eager O
hand O
. O
He O
clutched O
it O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
seized O
the O
boat-knife O
, O
and O
impaling O
the O
letter O
on O
it O
, O
sent O
it O
thus O
loaded O
back O
into O
the O
ship O
. O
It O
fell O
at O
Ahab O
's O
feet O
. O
Then O
Gabriel O
shrieked O
out O
to O
his O
comrades O
to O
give O
way O
with O
their O
oars O
, O
and O
in O
that O
manner O
the O
mutinous O
boat O
rapidly O
shot O
away O
from O
the O
Pequod O
. O
As O
, O
after O
this O
interlude O
, O
the O
seamen O
resumed O
their O
work O
upon O
the O
jacket O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
many O
strange O
things O
were O
hinted O
in O
reference O
to O
this O
wild O
affair O
. O
