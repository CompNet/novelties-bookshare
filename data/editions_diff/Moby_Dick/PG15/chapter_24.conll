As O
Queequeg O
and O
I O
are O
now O
fairly O
embarked O
in O
this O
business O
of O
whaling O
; O
and O
as O
this O
business O
of O
whaling O
has O
somehow O
come O
to O
be O
regarded O
among O
landsmen O
as O
a O
rather O
unpoetical O
and O
disreputable O
pursuit O
; O
therefore O
, O
I O
am O
all O
anxiety O
to O
convince O
ye O
, O
ye O
landsmen O
, O
of O
the O
injustice O
hereby O
done O
to O
us O
hunters O
of O
whales O
. O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
it O
may O
be O
deemed O
almost O
superfluous O
to O
establish O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
among O
people O
at O
large O
, O
the O
business O
of O
whaling O
is O
not O
accounted O
on O
a O
level O
with O
what O
are O
called O
the O
liberal O
professions O
. O
If O
a O
stranger O
were O
introduced O
into O
any O
miscellaneous O
metropolitan O
society O
, O
it O
would O
but O
slightly O
advance O
the O
general O
opinion O
of O
his O
merits O
, O
were O
he O
presented O
to O
the O
company O
as O
a O
harpooneer O
, O
say O
; O
and O
if O
in O
emulation O
of O
the O
naval O
officers O
he O
should O
append O
the O
initials O
S. O
W. O
F. O
( O
Sperm O
Whale O
Fishery O
) O
to O
his O
visiting O
card O
, O
such O
a O
procedure O
would O
be O
deemed O
pre-eminently O
presuming O
and O
ridiculous O
. O
Doubtless O
one O
leading O
reason O
why O
the O
world O
declines O
honoring O
us O
whalemen O
, O
is O
this O
: O
they O
think O
that O
, O
at O
best O
, O
our O
vocation O
amounts O
to O
a O
butchering O
sort O
of O
business O
; O
and O
that O
when O
actively O
engaged O
therein O
, O
we O
are O
surrounded O
by O
all O
manner O
of O
defilements O
. O
Butchers O
we O
are O
, O
that O
is O
true O
. O
But O
butchers O
, O
also O
, O
and O
butchers O
of O
the O
bloodiest O
badge O
have O
been O
all O
Martial O
Commanders O
whom O
the O
world O
invariably O
delights O
to O
honor O
. O
And O
as O
for O
the O
matter O
of O
the O
alleged O
uncleanliness O
of O
our O
business O
, O
ye O
shall O
soon O
be O
initiated O
into O
certain O
facts O
hitherto O
pretty O
generally O
unknown O
, O
and O
which O
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
will O
triumphantly O
plant O
the O
sperm O
whale-ship O
at O
least O
among O
the O
cleanliest O
things O
of O
this O
tidy O
earth O
. O
But O
even O
granting O
the O
charge O
in O
question O
to O
be O
true O
; O
what O
disordered O
slippery O
decks O
of O
a O
whale-ship O
are O
comparable O
to O
the O
unspeakable O
carrion O
of O
those O
battle-fields O
from O
which O
so O
many O
soldiers O
return O
to O
drink O
in O
all O
ladies O
' O
plaudits O
? O
And O
if O
the O
idea O
of O
peril O
so O
much O
enhances O
the O
popular O
conceit O
of O
the O
soldier O
's O
profession O
; O
let O
me O
assure O
ye O
that O
many O
a O
veteran O
who O
has O
freely O
marched O
up O
to O
a O
battery O
, O
would O
quickly O
recoil O
at O
the O
apparition O
of O
the O
sperm O
whale O
's O
vast O
tail O
, O
fanning O
into O
eddies O
the O
air O
over O
his O
head O
. O
For O
what O
are O
the O
comprehensible O
terrors O
of O
man O
compared O
with O
the O
interlinked O
terrors O
and O
wonders O
of O
God O
! O
But O
, O
though O
the O
world O
scouts O
at O
us O
whale O
hunters O
, O
yet O
does O
it O
unwittingly O
pay O
us O
the O
profoundest O
homage O
; O
yea O
, O
an O
all-abounding O
adoration O
! O
for O
almost O
all O
the O
tapers O
, O
lamps O
, O
and O
candles O
that O
burn O
round O
the O
globe O
, O
burn O
, O
as O
before O
so O
many O
shrines O
, O
to O
our O
glory O
! O
But O
look O
at O
this O
matter O
in O
other O
lights O
; O
weigh O
it O
in O
all O
sorts O
of O
scales O
; O
see O
what O
we O
whalemen O
are O
, O
and O
have O
been O
. O
Why O
did O
the O
Dutch O
in O
De O
Witt O
's O
time O
have O
admirals O
of O
their O
whaling O
fleets O
? O
Why O
did O
Louis O
XVI O
. O
of O
France O
, O
at O
his O
own O
personal O
expense O
, O
fit O
out O
whaling O
ships O
from O
Dunkirk O
, O
and O
politely O
invite O
to O
that O
town O
some O
score O
or O
two O
of O
families O
from O
our O
own O
island O
of O
Nantucket O
? O
Why O
did O
Britain O
between O
the O
years O
1750 O
and O
1788 O
pay O
to O
her O
whalemen O
in O
bounties O
upwards O
of O
£1,000,000 O
? O
And O
lastly O
, O
how O
comes O
it O
that O
we O
whalemen O
of O
America O
now O
outnumber O
all O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
banded O
whalemen O
in O
the O
world O
; O
sail O
a O
navy O
of O
upwards O
of O
seven O
hundred O
vessels O
; O
manned O
by O
eighteen O
thousand O
men O
; O
yearly O
consuming O
4,000,000 O
of O
dollars O
; O
the O
ships O
worth O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
sailing O
, O
$ O
20,000,000 O
; O
and O
every O
year O
importing O
into O
our O
harbors O
a O
well O
reaped O
harvest O
of O
$ O
7,000,000 O
. O
How O
comes O
all O
this O
, O
if O
there O
be O
not O
something O
puissant O
in O
whaling O
? O
But O
this O
is O
not O
the O
half O
; O
look O
again O
. O
I O
freely O
assert O
, O
that O
the O
cosmopolite O
philosopher O
can O
not O
, O
for O
his O
life O
, O
point O
out O
one O
single O
peaceful O
influence O
, O
which O
within O
the O
last O
sixty O
years O
has O
operated O
more O
potentially O
upon O
the O
whole O
broad O
world O
, O
taken O
in O
one O
aggregate O
, O
than O
the O
high O
and O
mighty O
business O
of O
whaling O
. O
One O
way O
and O
another O
, O
it O
has O
begotten O
events O
so O
remarkable O
in O
themselves O
, O
and O
so O
continuously O
momentous O
in O
their O
sequential O
issues O
, O
that O
whaling O
may O
well O
be O
regarded O
as O
that O
Egyptian O
mother O
, O
who O
bore O
offspring O
themselves O
pregnant O
from O
her O
womb O
. O
It O
would O
be O
a O
hopeless O
, O
endless O
task O
to O
catalogue O
all O
these O
things O
. O
Let O
a O
handful O
suffice O
. O
For O
many O
years O
past O
the O
whale-ship O
has O
been O
the O
pioneer O
in O
ferreting O
out O
the O
remotest O
and O
least O
known O
parts O
of O
the O
earth O
. O
She O
has O
explored O
seas O
and O
archipelagoes O
which O
had O
no O
chart O
, O
where O
no O
Cook O
or O
Vancouver O
had O
ever O
sailed O
. O
If O
American O
and O
European O
men-of-war O
now O
peacefully O
ride O
in O
once O
savage O
harbors O
, O
let O
them O
fire O
salutes O
to O
the O
honor O
and O
glory O
of O
the O
whale-ship O
, O
which O
originally O
showed O
them O
the O
way O
, O
and O
first O
interpreted O
between O
them O
and O
the O
savages O
. O
They O
may O
celebrate O
as O
they O
will O
the O
heroes O
of O
Exploring O
Expeditions O
, O
your O
Cookes O
, O
your O
Krusensterns O
; O
but O
I O
say O
that O
scores O
of O
anonymous O
Captains O
have O
sailed O
out O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
that O
were O
as O
great O
, O
and O
greater O
than O
your O
Cooke O
and O
your O
Krusenstern O
. O
For O
in O
their O
succorless O
empty-handedness O
, O
they O
, O
in O
the O
heathenish O
sharked O
waters O
, O
and O
by O
the O
beaches O
of O
unrecorded O
, O
javelin O
islands O
, O
battled O
with O
virgin O
wonders O
and O
terrors O
that O
Cooke O
with O
all O
his O
marines O
and O
muskets O
would O
not O
willingly O
have O
dared O
. O
All O
that O
is O
made O
such O
a O
flourish O
of O
in O
the O
old O
South O
Sea O
Voyages O
, O
those O
things O
were O
but O
the O
life-time O
commonplaces O
of O
our O
heroic O
Nantucketers O
. O
Often O
, O
adventures O
which O
Vancouver O
dedicates O
three O
chapters O
to O
, O
these O
men O
accounted O
unworthy O
of O
being O
set O
down O
in O
the O
ship O
's O
common O
log O
. O
Ah O
, O
the O
world O
! O
Oh O
, O
the O
world O
! O
Until O
the O
whale O
fishery O
rounded O
Cape O
Horn O
, O
no O
commerce O
but O
colonial O
, O
scarcely O
any O
intercourse O
but O
colonial O
, O
was O
carried O
on O
between O
Europe O
and O
the O
long O
line O
of O
the O
opulent O
Spanish O
provinces O
on O
the O
Pacific O
coast O
. O
It O
was O
the O
whaleman O
who O
first O
broke O
through O
the O
jealous O
policy O
of O
the O
Spanish O
crown O
, O
touching O
those O
colonies O
; O
and O
, O
if O
space O
permitted O
, O
it O
might O
be O
distinctly O
shown O
how O
from O
those O
whalemen O
at O
last O
eventuated O
the O
liberation O
of O
Peru O
, O
Chili O
, O
and O
Bolivia O
from O
the O
yoke O
of O
Old O
Spain O
, O
and O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
eternal O
democracy O
in O
those O
parts O
. O
That O
great O
America O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
sphere O
, O
Australia O
, O
was O
given O
to O
the O
enlightened O
world O
by O
the O
whaleman O
. O
After O
its O
first O
blunder-born O
discovery O
by O
a O
Dutchman O
, O
all O
other O
ships O
long O
shunned O
those O
shores O
as O
pestiferously O
barbarous O
; O
but O
the O
whale-ship O
touched O
there O
. O
The O
whale-ship O
is O
the O
true O
mother O
of O
that O
now O
mighty O
colony O
. O
Moreover O
, O
in O
the O
infancy O
of O
the O
first O
Australian O
settlement O
, O
the O
emigrants O
were O
several O
times O
saved O
from O
starvation O
by O
the O
benevolent O
biscuit O
of O
the O
whale-ship O
luckily O
dropping O
an O
anchor O
in O
their O
waters O
. O
The O
uncounted O
isles O
of O
all O
Polynesia O
confess O
the O
same O
truth O
, O
and O
do O
commercial O
homage O
to O
the O
whale-ship O
, O
that O
cleared O
the O
way O
for O
the O
missionary O
and O
the O
merchant O
, O
and O
in O
many O
cases O
carried O
the O
primitive O
missionaries O
to O
their O
first O
destinations O
. O
If O
that O
double-bolted O
land O
, O
Japan O
, O
is O
ever O
to O
become O
hospitable O
, O
it O
is O
the O
whale-ship O
alone O
to O
whom O
the O
credit O
will O
be O
due O
; O
for O
already O
she O
is O
on O
the O
threshold O
. O
But O
if O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
all O
this O
, O
you O
still O
declare O
that O
whaling O
has O
no O
æsthetically O
noble O
associations O
connected O
with O
it O
, O
then O
am O
I O
ready O
to O
shiver O
fifty O
lances O
with O
you O
there O
, O
and O
unhorse O
you O
with O
a O
split O
helmet O
