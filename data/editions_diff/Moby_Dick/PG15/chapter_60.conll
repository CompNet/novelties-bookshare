With O
reference O
to O
the O
whaling O
scene O
shortly O
to O
be O
described O
, O
as O
well O
as O
for O
the O
better O
understanding O
of O
all O
similar O
scenes O
elsewhere O
presented O
, O
I O
have O
here O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
magical O
, O
sometimes O
horrible O
whale-line O
. O
The O
line O
originally O
used O
in O
the O
fishery O
was O
of O
the O
best O
hemp O
, O
slightly O
vapored O
with O
tar O
, O
not O
impregnated O
with O
it O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
ordinary O
ropes O
; O
for O
while O
tar O
, O
as O
ordinarily O
used O
, O
makes O
the O
hemp O
more O
pliable O
to O
the O
rope-maker O
, O
and O
also O
renders O
the O
rope O
itself O
more O
convenient O
to O
the O
sailor O
for O
common O
ship O
use O
; O
yet O
, O
not O
only O
would O
the O
ordinary O
quantity O
too O
much O
stiffen O
the O
whale-line O
for O
the O
close O
coiling O
to O
which O
it O
must O
be O
subjected O
; O
but O
as O
most O
seamen O
are O
beginning O
to O
learn O
, O
tar O
in O
general O
by O
no O
means O
adds O
to O
the O
rope O
's O
durability O
or O
strength O
, O
however O
much O
it O
may O
give O
it O
compactness O
and O
gloss O
. O
Of O
late O
years O
the O
Manilla O
rope O
has O
in O
the O
American O
fishery O
almost O
entirely O
superseded O
hemp O
as O
a O
material O
for O
whale-lines O
; O
for O
, O
though O
not O
so O
durable O
as O
hemp O
, O
it O
is O
stronger O
, O
and O
far O
more O
soft O
and O
elastic O
; O
and O
I O
will O
add O
( O
since O
there O
is O
an O
æsthetics O
in O
all O
things O
) O
, O
is O
much O
more O
handsome O
and O
becoming O
to O
the O
boat O
, O
than O
hemp O
. O
Hemp O
is O
a O
dusky O
, O
dark O
fellow O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
Indian O
; O
but O
Manilla O
is O
as O
a O
golden-haired O
Circassian O
to O
behold O
. O
The O
whale O
line O
is O
only O
two O
thirds O
of O
an O
inch O
in O
thickness O
. O
At O
first O
sight O
, O
you O
would O
not O
think O
it O
so O
strong O
as O
it O
really O
is O
. O
By O
experiment O
its O
one O
and O
fifty O
yarns O
will O
each O
suspend O
a O
weight O
of O
one O
hundred O
and O
twenty O
pounds O
; O
so O
that O
the O
whole O
rope O
will O
bear O
a O
strain O
nearly O
equal O
to O
three O
tons O
. O
In O
length O
, O
the O
common O
sperm O
whale-line O
measures O
something O
over O
two O
hundred O
fathoms O
. O
Towards O
the O
stern O
of O
the O
boat O
it O
is O
spirally O
coiled O
away O
in O
the O
tub O
, O
not O
like O
the O
worm-pipe O
of O
a O
still O
though O
, O
but O
so O
as O
to O
form O
one O
round O
, O
cheese-shaped O
mass O
of O
densely O
bedded O
" O
sheaves O
, O
" O
or O
layers O
of O
concentric O
spiralizations O
, O
without O
any O
hollow O
but O
the O
" O
heart O
, O
" O
or O
minute O
vertical O
tube O
formed O
at O
the O
axis O
of O
the O
cheese O
. O
As O
the O
least O
tangle O
or O
kink O
in O
the O
coiling O
would O
, O
in O
running O
out O
, O
infallibly O
take O
somebody O
's O
arm O
, O
leg O
, O
or O
entire O
body O
off O
, O
the O
utmost O
precaution O
is O
used O
in O
stowing O
the O
line O
in O
its O
tub O
. O
Some O
harpooneers O
will O
consume O
almost O
an O
entire O
morning O
in O
this O
business O
, O
carrying O
the O
line O
high O
aloft O
and O
then O
reeving O
it O
downwards O
through O
a O
block O
towards O
the O
tub O
, O
so O
as O
in O
the O
act O
of O
coiling O
to O
free O
it O
from O
all O
possible O
wrinkles O
and O
twists O
. O
In O
the O
English O
boats O
two O
tubs O
are O
used O
instead O
of O
one O
; O
the O
same O
line O
being O
continuously O
coiled O
in O
both O
tubs O
. O
There O
is O
some O
advantage O
in O
this O
; O
because O
these O
twin-tubs O
being O
so O
small O
they O
fit O
more O
readily O
into O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
do O
not O
strain O
it O
so O
much O
; O
whereas O
, O
the O
American O
tub O
, O
nearly O
three O
feet O
in O
diameter O
and O
of O
proportionate O
depth O
, O
makes O
a O
rather O
bulky O
freight O
for O
a O
craft O
whose O
planks O
are O
but O
one O
half-inch O
in O
thickness O
; O
for O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
whale-boat O
is O
like O
critical O
ice O
, O
which O
will O
bear O
up O
a O
considerable O
distributed O
weight O
, O
but O
not O
very O
much O
of O
a O
concentrated O
one O
. O
When O
the O
painted O
canvas O
cover O
is O
clapped O
on O
the O
American O
line-tub O
, O
the O
boat O
looks O
as O
if O
it O
were O
pulling O
off O
with O
a O
prodigious O
great O
wedding-cake O
to O
present O
to O
the O
whales O
. O
Both O
ends O
of O
the O
line O
are O
exposed O
; O
the O
lower O
end O
terminating O
in O
an O
eye-splice O
or O
loop O
coming O
up O
from O
the O
bottom O
against O
the O
side O
of O
the O
tub O
, O
and O
hanging O
over O
its O
edge O
completely O
disengaged O
from O
everything O
. O
This O
arrangement O
of O
the O
lower O
end O
is O
necessary O
on O
two O
accounts O
. O
First O
: O
In O
order O
to O
facilitate O
the O
fastening O
to O
it O
of O
an O
additional O
line O
from O
a O
neighboring O
boat O
, O
in O
case O
the O
stricken O
whale O
should O
sound O
so O
deep O
as O
to O
threaten O
to O
carry O
off O
the O
entire O
line O
originally O
attached O
to O
the O
harpoon O
. O
In O
these O
instances O
, O
the O
whale O
of O
course O
is O
shifted O
like O
a O
mug O
of O
ale O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
from O
the O
one O
boat O
to O
the O
other O
; O
though O
the O
first O
boat O
always O
hovers O
at O
hand O
to O
assist O
its O
consort O
. O
Second O
: O
This O
arrangement O
is O
indispensable O
for O
common O
safety O
's O
sake O
; O
for O
were O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
line O
in O
any O
way O
attached O
to O
the O
boat O
, O
and O
were O
the O
whale O
then O
to O
run O
the O
line O
out O
to O
the O
end O
almost O
in O
a O
single O
, O
smoking O
minute O
as O
he O
sometimes O
does O
, O
he O
would O
not O
stop O
there O
, O
for O
the O
doomed O
boat O
would O
infallibly O
be O
dragged O
down O
after O
him O
into O
the O
profundity O
of O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
in O
that O
case O
no O
town-crier O
would O
ever O
find O
her O
again O
. O
Before O
lowering O
the O
boat O
for O
the O
chase O
, O
the O
upper O
end O
of O
the O
line O
is O
taken O
aft O
from O
the O
tub O
, O
and O
passing O
round O
the O
loggerhead O
there O
, O
is O
again O
carried O
forward O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
resting O
crosswise O
upon O
the O
loom O
or O
handle O
of O
every O
man O
's O
oar O
, O
so O
that O
it O
jogs O
against O
his O
wrist O
in O
rowing O
; O
and O
also O
passing O
between O
the O
men O
, O
as O
they O
alternately O
sit O
at O
the O
opposite O
gunwales O
, O
to O
the O
leaded O
chocks O
or O
grooves O
in O
the O
extreme O
pointed O
prow O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
where O
a O
wooden O
pin O
or O
skewer O
the O
size O
of O
a O
common O
quill O
, O
prevents O
it O
from O
slipping O
out O
. O
From O
the O
chocks O
it O
hangs O
in O
a O
slight O
festoon O
over O
the O
bows O
, O
and O
is O
then O
passed O
inside O
the O
boat O
again O
; O
and O
some O
ten O
or O
twenty O
fathoms O
( O
called O
box-line O
) O
being O
coiled O
upon O
the O
box O
in O
the O
bows O
, O
it O
continues O
its O
way O
to O
the O
gunwale O
still O
a O
little O
further O
aft O
, O
and O
is O
then O
attached O
to O
the O
short-warp—the O
rope O
which O
is O
immediately O
connected O
with O
the O
harpoon O
; O
but O
previous O
to O
that O
connexion O
, O
the O
short-warp O
goes O
through O
sundry O
mystifications O
too O
tedious O
to O
detail O
. O
Thus O
the O
whale-line O
folds O
the O
whole O
boat O
in O
its O
complicated O
coils O
, O
twisting O
and O
writhing O
around O
it O
in O
almost O
every O
direction O
. O
All O
the O
oarsmen O
are O
involved O
in O
its O
perilous O
contortions O
; O
so O
that O
to O
the O
timid O
eye O
of O
the O
landsman O
, O
they O
seem O
as O
Indian O
jugglers O
, O
with O
the O
deadliest O
snakes O
sportively O
festooning O
their O
limbs O
. O
Nor O
can O
any O
son O
of O
mortal O
woman O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
seat O
himself O
amid O
those O
hempen O
intricacies O
, O
and O
while O
straining O
his O
utmost O
at O
the O
oar O
, O
bethink O
him O
that O
at O
any O
unknown O
instant O
the O
harpoon O
may O
be O
darted O
, O
and O
all O
these O
horrible O
contortions O
be O
put O
in O
play O
like O
ringed O
lightnings O
; O
he O
can O
not O
be O
thus O
circumstanced O
without O
a O
shudder O
that O
makes O
the O
very O
marrow O
in O
his O
bones O
to O
quiver O
in O
him O
like O
a O
shaken O
jelly O
. O
Yet O
habit—strange O
thing O
! O
what O
can O
not O
habit O
accomplish O
? O
—Gayer O
sallies O
, O
more O
merry O
mirth O
, O
better O
jokes O
, O
and O
brighter O
repartees O
, O
you O
never O
heard O
over O
your O
mahogany O
, O
than O
you O
will O
hear O
over O
the O
half-inch O
white O
cedar O
of O
the O
whale-boat O
, O
when O
thus O
hung O
in O
hangman O
's O
nooses O
; O
and O
, O
like O
the O
six O
burghers O
of O
Calais O
before O
King O
Edward O
, O
the O
six O
men O
composing O
the O
crew O
pull O
into O
the O
jaws O
of O
death O
, O
with O
a O
halter O
around O
every O
neck O
, O
as O
you O
may O
say O
. O
Perhaps O
a O
very O
little O
thought O
will O
now O
enable O
you O
to O
account O
for O
those O
repeated O
whaling O
disasters—some O
few O
of O
which O
are O
casually O
chronicled—of O
this O
man O
or O
that O
man O
being O
taken O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
by O
the O
line O
, O
and O
lost O
. O
For O
, O
when O
the O
line O
is O
darting O
out O
, O
to O
be O
seated O
then O
in O
the O
boat O
, O
is O
like O
being O
seated O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
manifold O
whizzings O
of O
a O
steam-engine O
in O
full O
play O
, O
when O
every O
flying O
beam O
, O
and O
shaft O
, O
and O
wheel O
, O
is O
grazing O
you O
. O
It O
is O
worse O
; O
for O
you O
can O
not O
sit O
motionless O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
these O
perils O
, O
because O
the O
boat O
is O
rocking O
like O
a O
cradle O
, O
and O
you O
are O
pitched O
one O
way O
and O
the O
other O
, O
without O
the O
slightest O
warning O
; O
and O
only O
by O
a O
certain O
self-adjusting O
buoyancy O
and O
simultaneousness O
of O
volition O
and O
action O
, O
can O
you O
escape O
being O
made O
a O
Mazeppa O
of O
, O
and O
run O
away O
with O
where O
the O
all-seeing O
sun O
himself O
could O
never O
pierce O
you O
out O
. O
Again O
: O
as O
the O
profound O
calm O
which O
only O
apparently O
precedes O
and O
prophesies O
of O
the O
storm O
, O
is O
perhaps O
more O
awful O
than O
the O
storm O
itself O
; O
for O
, O
indeed O
, O
the O
calm O
is O
but O
the O
wrapper O
and O
envelope O
of O
the O
storm O
; O
and O
contains O
it O
in O
itself O
, O
as O
the O
seemingly O
harmless O
rifle O
holds O
the O
fatal O
powder O
, O
and O
the O
ball O
, O
and O
the O
explosion O
; O
so O
the O
graceful O
repose O
of O
the O
line O
, O
as O
it O
silently O
serpentines O
about O
the O
oarsmen O
before O
being O
brought O
into O
actual O
play—this O
is O
a O
thing O
which O
carries O
more O
of O
true O
terror O
than O
any O
other O
aspect O
of O
this O
dangerous O
affair O
. O
But O
why O
say O
more O
? O
All O
men O
live O
enveloped O
in O
whale-lines O
. O
All O
are O
born O
with O
halters O
round O
their O
necks O
; O
but O
it O
is O
only O
when O
caught O
in O
the O
swift O
, O
sudden O
turn O
of O
death O
, O
that O
mortals O
realize O
the O
silent O
, O
subtle O
, O
ever-present O
perils O
of O
life O
. O
And O
if O
you O
be O
a O
philosopher O
, O
though O
seated O
in O
the O
whale-boat O
, O
you O
would O
not O
at O
heart O
feel O
one O
whit O
more O
of O
terror O
, O
than O
though O
seated O
before O
your O
evening O
fire O
with O
a O
poker O
, O
and O
not O
a O
harpoon O
, O
by O
your O
side O
. O
