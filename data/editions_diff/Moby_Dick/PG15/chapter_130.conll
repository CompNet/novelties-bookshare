And O
now O
that O
at O
the O
proper O
time O
and O
place O
, O
after O
so O
long O
and O
wide O
a O
preliminary O
cruise O
, O
Ahab O
, O
—all O
other O
whaling O
waters O
swept—seemed O
to O
have O
chased O
his O
foe O
into O
an O
ocean-fold O
, O
to O
slay O
him O
the O
more O
securely O
there O
; O
now O
, O
that O
he O
found O
himself O
hard O
by O
the O
very O
latitude O
and O
longitude O
where O
his O
tormenting O
wound O
had O
been O
inflicted O
; O
now O
that O
a O
vessel O
had O
been O
spoken O
which O
on O
the O
very O
day O
preceding O
had O
actually O
encountered O
Moby O
Dick O
; O
—and O
now O
that O
all O
his O
successive O
meetings O
with O
various O
ships O
contrastingly O
concurred O
to O
show O
the O
demoniac O
indifference O
with O
which O
the O
white O
whale O
tore O
his O
hunters O
, O
whether O
sinning O
or O
sinned O
against O
; O
now O
it O
was O
that O
there O
lurked O
a O
something O
in O
the O
old O
man O
's O
eyes O
, O
which O
it O
was O
hardly O
sufferable O
for O
feeble O
souls O
to O
see O
. O
As O
the O
unsetting O
polar O
star O
, O
which O
through O
the O
livelong O
, O
arctic O
, O
six O
months O
' O
night O
sustains O
its O
piercing O
, O
steady O
, O
central O
gaze O
; O
so O
Ahab O
's O
purpose O
now O
fixedly O
gleamed O
down O
upon O
the O
constant O
midnight O
of O
the O
gloomy O
crew O
. O
It O
domineered O
above O
them O
so O
, O
that O
all O
their O
bodings O
, O
doubts O
, O
misgivings O
, O
fears O
, O
were O
fain O
to O
hide O
beneath O
their O
souls O
, O
and O
not O
sprout O
forth O
a O
single O
spear O
or O
leaf O
. O
In O
this O
foreshadowing O
interval O
too O
, O
all O
humor O
, O
forced O
or O
natural O
, O
vanished O
. O
Stubb O
no O
more O
strove O
to O
raise O
a O
smile O
; O
Starbuck O
no O
more O
strove O
to O
check O
one O
. O
Alike O
, O
joy O
and O
sorrow O
, O
hope O
and O
fear O
, O
seemed O
ground O
to O
finest O
dust O
, O
and O
powdered O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
in O
the O
clamped O
mortar O
of O
Ahab O
's O
iron O
soul O
. O
Like O
machines O
, O
they O
dumbly O
moved O
about O
the O
deck O
, O
ever O
conscious O
that O
the O
old O
man O
's O
despot O
eye O
was O
on O
them O
. O
But O
did O
you O
deeply O
scan O
him O
in O
his O
more O
secret O
confidential O
hours O
; O
when O
he O
thought O
no O
glance O
but O
one O
was O
on O
him O
; O
then O
you O
would O
have O
seen O
that O
even O
as O
Ahab O
's O
eyes O
so O
awed O
the O
crew O
's O
, O
the O
inscrutable O
Parsee O
's O
glance O
awed O
his O
; O
or O
somehow O
, O
at O
least O
, O
in O
some O
wild O
way O
, O
at O
times O
affected O
it O
. O
Such O
an O
added O
, O
gliding O
strangeness O
began O
to O
invest O
the O
thin O
Fedallah O
now O
; O
such O
ceaseless O
shudderings O
shook O
him O
; O
that O
the O
men O
looked O
dubious O
at O
him O
; O
half O
uncertain O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
whether O
indeed O
he O
were O
a O
mortal O
substance O
, O
or O
else O
a O
tremulous O
shadow O
cast O
upon O
the O
deck O
by O
some O
unseen O
being O
's O
body O
. O
And O
that O
shadow O
was O
always O
hovering O
there O
. O
For O
not O
by O
night O
, O
even O
, O
had O
Fedallah O
ever O
certainly O
been O
known O
to O
slumber O
, O
or O
go O
below O
. O
He O
would O
stand O
still O
for O
hours O
: O
but O
never O
sat O
or O
leaned O
; O
his O
wan O
but O
wondrous O
eyes O
did O
plainly O
say—We O
two O
watchmen O
never O
rest O
. O
Nor O
, O
at O
any O
time O
, O
by O
night O
or O
day O
could O
the O
mariners O
now O
step O
upon O
the O
deck O
, O
unless O
Ahab O
was O
before O
them O
; O
either O
standing O
in O
his O
pivot-hole O
, O
or O
exactly O
pacing O
the O
planks O
between O
two O
undeviating O
limits O
, O
—the O
main-mast O
and O
the O
mizen O
; O
or O
else O
they O
saw O
him O
standing O
in O
the O
cabin-scuttle O
, O
—his O
living O
foot O
advanced O
upon O
the O
deck O
, O
as O
if O
to O
step O
; O
his O
hat O
slouched O
heavily O
over O
his O
eyes O
; O
so O
that O
however O
motionless O
he O
stood O
, O
however O
the O
days O
and O
nights O
were O
added O
on O
, O
that O
he O
had O
not O
swung O
in O
his O
hammock O
; O
yet O
hidden O
beneath O
that O
slouching O
hat O
, O
they O
could O
never O
tell O
unerringly O
whether O
, O
for O
all O
this O
, O
his O
eyes O
were O
really O
closed O
at O
times O
; O
or O
whether O
he O
was O
still O
intently O
scanning O
them O
; O
no O
matter O
, O
though O
he O
stood O
so O
in O
the O
scuttle O
for O
a O
whole O
hour O
on O
the O
stretch O
, O
and O
the O
unheeded O
night-damp O
gathered O
in O
beads O
of O
dew O
upon O
that O
stone-carved O
coat O
and O
hat O
. O
The O
clothes O
that O
the O
night O
had O
wet O
, O
the O
next O
day O
's O
sunshine O
dried O
upon O
him O
; O
and O
so O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
and O
night O
after O
night O
; O
he O
went O
no O
more O
beneath O
the O
planks O
; O
whatever O
he O
wanted O
from O
the O
cabin O
that O
thing O
he O
sent O
for O
. O
He O
ate O
in O
the O
same O
open O
air O
; O
that O
is O
, O
his O
two O
only O
meals O
, O
—breakfast O
and O
dinner O
: O
supper O
he O
never O
touched O
; O
nor O
reaped O
his O
beard O
; O
which O
darkly O
grew O
all O
gnarled O
, O
as O
unearthed O
roots O
of O
trees O
blown O
over O
, O
which O
still O
grow O
idly O
on O
at O
naked O
base O
, O
though O
perished O
in O
the O
upper O
verdure O
. O
But O
though O
his O
whole O
life O
was O
now O
become O
one O
watch O
on O
deck O
; O
and O
though O
the O
Parsee O
's O
mystic O
watch O
was O
without O
intermission O
as O
his O
own O
; O
yet O
these O
two O
never O
seemed O
to O
speak—one O
man O
to O
the O
other—unless O
at O
long O
intervals O
some O
passing O
unmomentous O
matter O
made O
it O
necessary O
. O
Though O
such O
a O
potent O
spell O
seemed O
secretly O
to O
join O
the O
twain O
; O
openly O
, O
and O
to O
the O
awe-struck O
crew O
, O
they O
seemed O
pole-like O
asunder O
. O
If O
by O
day O
they O
chanced O
to O
speak O
one O
word O
; O
by O
night O
, O
dumb O
men O
were O
both O
, O
so O
far O
as O
concerned O
the O
slightest O
verbal O
interchange O
. O
At O
times O
, O
for O
longest O
hours O
, O
without O
a O
single O
hail O
, O
they O
stood O
far O
parted O
in O
the O
starlight O
; O
Ahab O
in O
his O
scuttle O
, O
the O
Parsee O
by O
the O
mainmast O
; O
but O
still O
fixedly O
gazing O
upon O
each O
other O
; O
as O
if O
in O
the O
Parsee O
Ahab O
saw O
his O
forethrown O
shadow O
, O
in O
Ahab O
the O
Parsee O
his O
abandoned O
substance O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
somehow O
, O
did O
Ahab—in O
his O
own O
proper O
self O
, O
as O
daily O
, O
hourly O
, O
and O
every O
instant O
, O
commandingly O
revealed O
to O
his O
subordinates O
, O
—Ahab O
seemed O
an O
independent O
lord O
; O
the O
Parsee O
but O
his O
slave O
. O
Still O
again O
both O
seemed O
yoked O
together O
, O
and O
an O
unseen O
tyrant O
driving O
them O
; O
the O
lean O
shade O
siding O
the O
solid O
rib O
. O
For O
be O
this O
Parsee O
what O
he O
may O
, O
all O
rib O
and O
keel O
was O
solid O
Ahab O
. O
At O
the O
first O
faintest O
glimmering O
of O
the O
dawn O
, O
his O
iron O
voice O
was O
heard O
from O
aft— O
" O
Man O
the O
mast-heads O
! O
" O
—and O
all O
through O
the O
day O
, O
till O
after O
sunset O
and O
after O
twilight O
, O
the O
same O
voice O
every O
hour O
, O
at O
the O
striking O
of O
the O
helmsman O
's O
bell O
, O
was O
heard— O
" O
What O
d O
'ye O
see O
? O
—sharp O
! O
sharp O
! O
" O
But O
when O
three O
or O
four O
days O
had O
slided O
by O
, O
after O
meeting O
the O
children-seeking O
Rachel O
; O
and O
no O
spout O
had O
yet O
been O
seen O
; O
the O
monomaniac O
old O
man O
seemed O
distrustful O
of O
his O
crew O
's O
fidelity O
; O
at O
least O
, O
of O
nearly O
all O
except O
the O
Pagan O
harpooneers O
; O
he O
seemed O
to O
doubt O
, O
even O
, O
whether O
Stubb O
and O
Flask O
might O
not O
willingly O
overlook O
the O
sight O
he O
sought O
. O
But O
if O
these O
suspicions O
were O
really O
his O
, O
he O
sagaciously O
refrained O
from O
verbally O
expressing O
them O
, O
however O
his O
actions O
might O
seem O
to O
hint O
them O
. O
" O
I O
will O
have O
the O
first O
sight O
of O
the O
whale O
myself O
, O
" O
—he O
said O
. O
" O
Aye O
! O
Ahab O
must O
have O
the O
doubloon O
! O
" O
and O
with O
his O
own O
hands O
he O
rigged O
a O
nest O
of O
basketed O
bowlines O
; O
and O
sending O
a O
hand O
aloft O
, O
with O
a O
single O
sheaved O
block O
, O
to O
secure O
to O
the O
main-mast O
head O
, O
he O
received O
the O
two O
ends O
of O
the O
downward-reeved O
rope O
; O
and O
attaching O
one O
to O
his O
basket O
prepared O
a O
pin O
for O
the O
other O
end O
, O
in O
order O
to O
fasten O
it O
at O
the O
rail O
. O
This O
done O
, O
with O
that O
end O
yet O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
standing O
beside O
the O
pin O
, O
he O
looked O
round O
upon O
his O
crew O
, O
sweeping O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
; O
pausing O
his O
glance O
long O
upon O
Daggoo O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
Tashtego O
; O
but O
shunning O
Fedallah O
; O
and O
then O
settling O
his O
firm O
relying O
eye O
upon O
the O
chief O
mate O
, O
said O
, O
— O
" O
Take O
the O
rope O
, O
sir—I O
give O
it O
into O
thy O
hands O
, O
Starbuck O
. O
" O
Then O
arranging O
his O
person O
in O
the O
basket O
, O
he O
gave O
the O
word O
for O
them O
to O
hoist O
him O
to O
his O
perch O
, O
Starbuck O
being O
the O
one O
who O
secured O
the O
rope O
at O
last O
; O
and O
afterwards O
stood O
near O
it O
. O
And O
thus O
, O
with O
one O
hand O
clinging O
round O
the O
royal O
mast O
, O
Ahab O
gazed O
abroad O
upon O
the O
sea O
for O
miles O
and O
miles O
, O
—ahead O
, O
astern O
, O
this O
side O
, O
and O
that O
, O
—within O
the O
wide O
expanded O
circle O
commanded O
at O
so O
great O
a O
height O
. O
When O
in O
working O
with O
his O
hands O
at O
some O
lofty O
almost O
isolated O
place O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
which O
chances O
to O
afford O
no O
foothold O
, O
the O
sailor O
at O
sea O
is O
hoisted O
up O
to O
that O
spot O
, O
and O
sustained O
there O
by O
the O
rope O
; O
under O
these O
circumstances O
, O
its O
fastened O
end O
on O
deck O
is O
always O
given O
in O
strict O
charge O
to O
some O
one O
man O
who O
has O
the O
special O
watch O
of O
it O
. O
Because O
in O
such O
a O
wilderness O
of O
running O
rigging O
, O
whose O
various O
different O
relations O
aloft O
can O
not O
always O
be O
infallibly O
discerned O
by O
what O
is O
seen O
of O
them O
at O
the O
deck O
; O
and O
when O
the O
deck-ends O
of O
these O
ropes O
are O
being O
every O
few O
minutes O
cast O
down O
from O
the O
fastenings O
, O
it O
would O
be O
but O
a O
natural O
fatality O
, O
if O
, O
unprovided O
with O
a O
constant O
watchman O
, O
the O
hoisted O
sailor O
should O
by O
some O
carelessness O
of O
the O
crew O
be O
cast O
adrift O
and O
fall O
all O
swooping O
to O
the O
sea O
. O
So O
Ahab O
's O
proceedings O
in O
this O
matter O
were O
not O
unusual O
; O
the O
only O
strange O
thing O
about O
them O
seemed O
to O
be O
, O
that O
Starbuck O
, O
almost O
the O
one O
only O
man O
who O
had O
ever O
ventured O
to O
oppose O
him O
with O
anything O
in O
the O
slightest O
degree O
approaching O
to O
decision—one O
of O
those O
too O
, O
whose O
faithfulness O
on O
the O
look-out O
he O
had O
seemed O
to O
doubt O
somewhat O
; O
—it O
was O
strange O
, O
that O
this O
was O
the O
very O
man O
he O
should O
select O
for O
his O
watchman O
; O
freely O
giving O
his O
whole O
life O
into O
such O
an O
otherwise O
distrusted O
person O
's O
hands O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
first O
time O
Ahab O
was O
perched O
aloft O
; O
ere O
he O
had O
been O
there O
ten O
minutes O
; O
one O
of O
those O
red-billed O
savage O
sea-hawks O
which O
so O
often O
fly O
incommodiously O
close O
round O
the O
manned O
mast-heads O
of O
whalemen O
in O
these O
latitudes O
; O
one O
of O
these O
birds O
came O
wheeling O
and O
screaming O
round O
his O
head O
in O
a O
maze O
of O
untrackably O
swift O
circlings O
. O
Then O
it O
darted O
a O
thousand O
feet O
straight O
up O
into O
the O
air O
; O
then O
spiralized O
downwards O
, O
and O
went O
eddying O
again O
round O
his O
head O
. O
But O
with O
his O
gaze O
fixed O
upon O
the O
dim O
and O
distant O
horizon O
, O
Ahab O
seemed O
not O
to O
mark O
this O
wild O
bird O
; O
nor O
, O
indeed O
, O
would O
any O
one O
else O
have O
marked O
it O
much O
, O
it O
being O
no O
uncommon O
circumstance O
; O
only O
now O
almost O
the O
least O
heedful O
eye O
seemed O
to O
see O
some O
sort O
of O
cunning O
meaning O
in O
almost O
every O
sight O
. O
" O
Your O
hat O
, O
your O
hat O
, O
sir O
! O
" O
suddenly O
cried O
the O
Sicilian O
seaman O
, O
who O
being O
posted O
at O
the O
mizen-mast-head O
, O
stood O
directly O
behind O
Ahab O
, O
though O
somewhat O
lower O
than O
his O
level O
, O
and O
with O
a O
deep O
gulf O
of O
air O
dividing O
them O
. O
But O
already O
the O
sable O
wing O
was O
before O
the O
old O
man O
's O
eyes O
; O
the O
long O
hooked O
bill O
at O
his O
head O
: O
with O
a O
scream O
, O
the O
black O
hawk O
darted O
away O
with O
his O
prize O
. O
An O
eagle O
flew O
thrice O
round O
Tarquin O
's O
head O
, O
removing O
his O
cap O
to O
replace O
it O
, O
and O
thereupon O
Tanaquil O
, O
his O
wife O
, O
declared O
that O
Tarquin O
would O
be O
king O
of O
Rome O
. O
But O
only O
by O
the O
replacing O
of O
the O
cap O
was O
that O
omen O
accounted O
good O
. O
Ahab O
's O
hat O
was O
never O
restored O
; O
the O
wild O
hawk O
flew O
on O
and O
on O
with O
it O
; O
far O
in O
advance O
of O
the O
prow O
: O
and O
at O
last O
disappeared O
; O
while O
from O
the O
point O
of O
that O
disappearance O
, O
a O
minute O
black O
spot O
was O
dimly O
discerned O
, O
falling O
from O
that O
vast O
height O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
