The O
season O
for O
the O
Line O
at O
length O
drew O
near O
; O
and O
every O
day O
when O
Ahab O
, O
coming O
from O
his O
cabin O
, O
cast O
his O
eyes O
aloft O
, O
the O
vigilant O
helmsman O
would O
ostentatiously O
handle O
his O
spokes O
, O
and O
the O
eager O
mariners O
quickly O
run O
to O
the O
braces O
, O
and O
would O
stand O
there O
with O
all O
their O
eyes O
centrally O
fixed O
on O
the O
nailed O
doubloon O
; O
impatient O
for O
the O
order O
to O
point O
the O
ship O
's O
prow O
for O
the O
equator O
. O
In O
good O
time O
the O
order O
came O
. O
It O
was O
hard O
upon O
high O
noon O
; O
and O
Ahab O
, O
seated O
in O
the O
bows O
of O
his O
high-hoisted O
boat O
, O
was O
about O
taking O
his O
wonted O
daily O
observation O
of O
the O
sun O
to O
determine O
his O
latitude O
. O
Now O
, O
in O
that O
Japanese O
sea O
, O
the O
days O
in O
summer O
are O
as O
freshets O
of O
effulgences O
. O
That O
unblinkingly O
vivid O
Japanese O
sun O
seems O
the O
blazing O
focus O
of O
the O
glassy O
ocean O
's O
immeasurable O
burning-glass O
. O
The O
sky O
looks O
lacquered O
; O
clouds O
there O
are O
none O
; O
the O
horizon O
floats O
; O
and O
this O
nakedness O
of O
unrelieved O
radiance O
is O
as O
the O
insufferable O
splendors O
of O
God O
's O
throne O
. O
Well O
that O
Ahab O
's O
quadrant O
was O
furnished O
with O
colored O
glasses O
, O
through O
which O
to O
take O
sight O
of O
that O
solar O
fire O
. O
So O
, O
swinging O
his O
seated O
form O
to O
the O
roll O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
with O
his O
astrological-looking O
instrument O
placed O
to O
his O
eye O
, O
he O
remained O
in O
that O
posture O
for O
some O
moments O
to O
catch O
the O
precise O
instant O
when O
the O
sun O
should O
gain O
its O
precise O
meridian O
. O
Meantime O
while O
his O
whole O
attention O
was O
absorbed O
, O
the O
Parsee O
was O
kneeling O
beneath O
him O
on O
the O
ship O
's O
deck O
, O
and O
with O
face O
thrown O
up O
like O
Ahab O
's O
, O
was O
eyeing O
the O
same O
sun O
with O
him O
; O
only O
the O
lids O
of O
his O
eyes O
half O
hooded O
their O
orbs O
, O
and O
his O
wild O
face O
was O
subdued O
to O
an O
earthly O
passionlessness O
. O
At O
length O
the O
desired O
observation O
was O
taken O
; O
and O
with O
his O
pencil O
upon O
his O
ivory O
leg O
, O
Ahab O
soon O
calculated O
what O
his O
latitude O
must O
be O
at O
that O
precise O
instant O
. O
Then O
falling O
into O
a O
moment O
's O
revery O
, O
he O
again O
looked O
up O
towards O
the O
sun O
and O
murmured O
to O
himself O
: O
" O
Thou O
sea-mark O
! O
thou O
high O
and O
mighty O
Pilot O
! O
thou O
tellest O
me O
truly O
where O
I O
_am_—but O
canst O
thou O
cast O
the O
least O
hint O
where O
I O
_shall_ O
be O
? O
Or O
canst O
thou O
tell O
where O
some O
other O
thing O
besides O
me O
is O
this O
moment O
living O
? O
Where O
is O
Moby O
Dick O
? O
This O
instant O
thou O
must O
be O
eyeing O
him O
. O
These O
eyes O
of O
mine O
look O
into O
the O
very O
eye O
that O
is O
even O
now O
beholding O
him O
; O
aye O
, O
and O
into O
the O
eye O
that O
is O
even O
now O
equally O
beholding O
the O
objects O
on O
the O
unknown O
, O
thither O
side O
of O
thee O
, O
thou O
sun O
! O
" O
Then O
gazing O
at O
his O
quadrant O
, O
and O
handling O
, O
one O
after O
the O
other O
, O
its O
numerous O
cabalistical O
contrivances O
, O
he O
pondered O
again O
, O
and O
muttered O
: O
" O
Foolish O
toy O
! O
babies O
' O
plaything O
of O
haughty O
Admirals O
, O
and O
Commodores O
, O
and O
Captains O
; O
the O
world O
brags O
of O
thee O
, O
of O
thy O
cunning O
and O
might O
; O
but O
what O
after O
all O
canst O
thou O
do O
, O
but O
tell O
the O
poor O
, O
pitiful O
point O
, O
where O
thou O
thyself O
happenest O
to O
be O
on O
this O
wide O
planet O
, O
and O
the O
hand O
that O
holds O
thee O
: O
no O
! O
not O
one O
jot O
more O
! O
Thou O
canst O
not O
tell O
where O
one O
drop O
of O
water O
or O
one O
grain O
of O
sand O
will O
be O
to-morrow O
noon O
; O
and O
yet O
with O
thy O
impotence O
thou O
insultest O
the O
sun O
! O
Science O
! O
Curse O
thee O
, O
thou O
vain O
toy O
; O
and O
cursed O
be O
all O
the O
things O
that O
cast O
man O
's O
eyes O
aloft O
to O
that O
heaven O
, O
whose O
live O
vividness O
but O
scorches O
him O
, O
as O
these O
old O
eyes O
are O
even O
now O
scorched O
with O
thy O
light O
, O
O O
sun O
! O
Level O
by O
nature O
to O
this O
earth O
's O
horizon O
are O
the O
glances O
of O
man O
's O
eyes O
; O
not O
shot O
from O
the O
crown O
of O
his O
head O
, O
as O
if O
God O
had O
meant O
him O
to O
gaze O
on O
his O
firmament O
. O
Curse O
thee O
, O
thou O
quadrant O
! O
" O
dashing O
it O
to O
the O
deck O
, O
" O
no O
longer O
will O
I O
guide O
my O
earthly O
way O
by O
thee O
; O
the O
level O
ship O
's O
compass O
, O
and O
the O
level O
dead-reckoning O
, O
by O
log O
and O
by O
line O
; O
_these_ O
shall O
conduct O
me O
, O
and O
show O
me O
my O
place O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
Aye O
, O
" O
lighting O
from O
the O
boat O
to O
the O
deck O
, O
" O
thus O
I O
trample O
on O
thee O
, O
thou O
paltry O
thing O
that O
feebly O
pointest O
on O
high O
; O
thus O
I O
split O
and O
destroy O
thee O
! O
" O
As O
the O
frantic O
old O
man O
thus O
spoke O
and O
thus O
trampled O
with O
his O
live O
and O
dead O
feet O
, O
a O
sneering O
triumph O
that O
seemed O
meant O
for O
Ahab O
, O
and O
a O
fatalistic O
despair O
that O
seemed O
meant O
for O
himself—these O
passed O
over O
the O
mute O
, O
motionless O
Parsee O
's O
face O
. O
Unobserved O
he O
rose O
and O
glided O
away O
; O
while O
, O
awestruck O
by O
the O
aspect O
of O
their O
commander O
, O
the O
seamen O
clustered O
together O
on O
the O
forecastle O
, O
till O
Ahab O
, O
troubledly O
pacing O
the O
deck O
, O
shouted O
out— O
" O
To O
the O
braces O
! O
Up O
helm O
! O
—square O
in O
! O
" O
In O
an O
instant O
the O
yards O
swung O
round O
; O
and O
as O
the O
ship O
half-wheeled O
upon O
her O
heel O
, O
her O
three O
firm-seated O
graceful O
masts O
erectly O
poised O
upon O
her O
long O
, O
ribbed O
hull O
, O
seemed O
as O
the O
three O
Horatii O
pirouetting O
on O
one O
sufficient O
steed O
. O
Standing O
between O
the O
knight-heads O
, O
Starbuck O
watched O
the O
Pequod O
's O
tumultuous O
way O
, O
and O
Ahab O
's O
also O
, O
as O
he O
went O
lurching O
along O
the O
deck O
. O
" O
I O
have O
sat O
before O
the O
dense O
coal O
fire O
and O
watched O
it O
all O
aglow O
, O
full O
of O
its O
tormented O
flaming O
life O
; O
and O
I O
have O
seen O
it O
wane O
at O
last O
, O
down O
, O
down O
, O
to O
dumbest O
dust O
. O
Old O
man O
of O
oceans O
! O
of O
all O
this O
fiery O
life O
of O
thine O
, O
what O
will O
at O
length O
remain O
but O
one O
little O
heap O
of O
ashes O
! O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
" O
cried O
Stubb O
, O
" O
but O
sea-coal O
ashes—mind O
ye O
that O
, O
Mr O
. O
Starbuck—sea-coal O
, O
not O
your O
common O
charcoal O
. O
Well O
, O
well O
; O
I O
heard O
Ahab O
mutter O
, O
'Here O
some O
one O
thrusts O
these O
cards O
into O
these O
old O
hands O
of O
mine O
; O
swears O
that O
I O
must O
play O
them O
, O
and O
no O
others O
. O
' O
And O
damn O
me O
, O
Ahab O
, O
but O
thou O
actest O
right O
; O
live O
in O
the O
game O
, O
and O
die O
it O
! O
