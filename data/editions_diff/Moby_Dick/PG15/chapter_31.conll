Next O
morning O
Stubb O
accosted O
Flask O
. O
" O
Such O
a O
queer O
dream O
, O
King-Post O
, O
I O
never O
had O
. O
You O
know O
the O
old O
man O
's O
ivory O
leg O
, O
well O
I O
dreamed O
he O
kicked O
me O
with O
it O
; O
and O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
kick O
back O
, O
upon O
my O
soul O
, O
my O
little O
man O
, O
I O
kicked O
my O
leg O
right O
off O
! O
And O
then O
, O
presto O
! O
Ahab O
seemed O
a O
pyramid O
, O
and O
I O
, O
like O
a O
blazing O
fool O
, O
kept O
kicking O
at O
it O
. O
But O
what O
was O
still O
more O
curious O
, O
Flask—you O
know O
how O
curious O
all O
dreams O
are—through O
all O
this O
rage O
that O
I O
was O
in O
, O
I O
somehow O
seemed O
to O
be O
thinking O
to O
myself O
, O
that O
after O
all O
, O
it O
was O
not O
much O
of O
an O
insult O
, O
that O
kick O
from O
Ahab O
. O
'Why O
, O
' O
thinks O
I O
, O
'what O
's O
the O
row O
? O
It O
's O
not O
a O
real O
leg O
, O
only O
a O
false O
leg O
. O
' O
And O
there O
's O
a O
mighty O
difference O
between O
a O
living O
thump O
and O
a O
dead O
thump O
. O
That O
's O
what O
makes O
a O
blow O
from O
the O
hand O
, O
Flask O
, O
fifty O
times O
more O
savage O
to O
bear O
than O
a O
blow O
from O
a O
cane O
. O
The O
living O
member—that O
makes O
the O
living O
insult O
, O
my O
little O
man O
. O
And O
thinks O
I O
to O
myself O
all O
the O
while O
, O
mind O
, O
while O
I O
was O
stubbing O
my O
silly O
toes O
against O
that O
cursed O
pyramid—so O
confoundedly O
contradictory O
was O
it O
all O
, O
all O
the O
while O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
was O
thinking O
to O
myself O
, O
'what O
's O
his O
leg O
now O
, O
but O
a O
cane—a O
whalebone O
cane O
. O
Yes O
, O
' O
thinks O
I O
, O
'it O
was O
only O
a O
playful O
cudgelling—in O
fact O
, O
only O
a O
whaleboning O
that O
he O
gave O
me—not O
a O
base O
kick O
. O
Besides O
, O
' O
thinks O
I O
, O
'look O
at O
it O
once O
; O
why O
, O
the O
end O
of O
it—the O
foot O
part—what O
a O
small O
sort O
of O
end O
it O
is O
; O
whereas O
, O
if O
a O
broad O
footed O
farmer O
kicked O
me O
, O
_there's_ O
a O
devilish O
broad O
insult O
. O
But O
this O
insult O
is O
whittled O
down O
to O
a O
point O
only O
. O
' O
But O
now O
comes O
the O
greatest O
joke O
of O
the O
dream O
, O
Flask O
. O
While O
I O
was O
battering O
away O
at O
the O
pyramid O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
badger-haired O
old O
merman O
, O
with O
a O
hump O
on O
his O
back O
, O
takes O
me O
by O
the O
shoulders O
, O
and O
slews O
me O
round O
. O
'What O
are O
you O
'bout O
? O
' O
says O
he O
. O
Slid O
! O
man O
, O
but O
I O
was O
frightened O
. O
Such O
a O
phiz O
! O
But O
, O
somehow O
, O
next O
moment O
I O
was O
over O
the O
fright O
. O
'What O
am O
I O
about O
? O
' O
says O
I O
at O
last O
. O
'And O
what O
business O
is O
that O
of O
yours O
, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
, O
Mr. O
Humpback O
? O
Do O
_you_ O
want O
a O
kick O
? O
' O
By O
the O
lord O
, O
Flask O
, O
I O
had O
no O
sooner O
said O
that O
, O
than O
he O
turned O
round O
his O
stern O
to O
me O
, O
bent O
over O
, O
and O
dragging O
up O
a O
lot O
of O
seaweed O
he O
had O
for O
a O
clout—what O
do O
you O
think O
, O
I O
saw O
? O
—why O
thunder O
alive O
, O
man O
, O
his O
stern O
was O
stuck O
full O
of O
marlinspikes O
, O
with O
the O
points O
out O
. O
Says O
I O
, O
on O
second O
thoughts O
, O
' O
I O
guess O
I O
wo O
n't O
kick O
you O
, O
old O
fellow O
. O
' O
'Wise O
Stubb O
, O
' O
said O
he O
, O
'wise O
Stubb O
; O
' O
and O
kept O
muttering O
it O
all O
the O
time O
, O
a O
sort O
of O
eating O
of O
his O
own O
gums O
like O
a O
chimney O
hag O
. O
Seeing O
he O
was O
n't O
going O
to O
stop O
saying O
over O
his O
'wise O
Stubb O
, O
wise O
Stubb O
, O
' O
I O
thought O
I O
might O
as O
well O
fall O
to O
kicking O
the O
pyramid O
again O
. O
But O
I O
had O
only O
just O
lifted O
my O
foot O
for O
it O
, O
when O
he O
roared O
out O
, O
'Stop O
that O
kicking O
! O
' O
'Halloa O
, O
' O
says O
I O
, O
'what O
's O
the O
matter O
now O
, O
old O
fellow O
? O
' O
'Look O
ye O
here O
, O
' O
says O
he O
; O
'let O
's O
argue O
the O
insult O
. O
Captain O
Ahab O
kicked O
ye O
, O
did O
n't O
he O
? O
' O
'Yes O
, O
he O
did O
, O
' O
says O
I—'right O
_here_ O
it O
was O
. O
' O
'Very O
good O
, O
' O
says O
he—'he O
used O
his O
ivory O
leg O
, O
did O
n't O
he O
? O
' O
'Yes O
, O
he O
did O
, O
' O
says O
I O
. O
'Well O
then O
, O
' O
says O
he O
, O
'wise O
Stubb O
, O
what O
have O
you O
to O
complain O
of O
? O
Did O
n't O
he O
kick O
with O
right O
good O
will O
? O
it O
was O
n't O
a O
common O
pitch O
pine O
leg O
he O
kicked O
with O
, O
was O
it O
? O
No O
, O
you O
were O
kicked O
by O
a O
great O
man O
, O
and O
with O
a O
beautiful O
ivory O
leg O
, O
Stubb O
. O
It O
's O
an O
honor O
; O
I O
consider O
it O
an O
honor O
. O
Listen O
, O
wise O
Stubb O
. O
In O
old O
England O
the O
greatest O
lords O
think O
it O
great O
glory O
to O
be O
slapped O
by O
a O
queen O
, O
and O
made O
garter-knights O
of O
; O
but O
, O
be O
_your_ O
boast O
, O
Stubb O
, O
that O
ye O
were O
kicked O
by O
old O
Ahab O
, O
and O
made O
a O
wise O
man O
of O
. O
Remember O
what O
I O
say O
; O
_be_ O
kicked O
by O
him O
; O
account O
his O
kicks O
honors O
; O
and O
on O
no O
account O
kick O
back O
; O
for O
you O
ca O
n't O
help O
yourself O
, O
wise O
Stubb O
. O
Do O
n't O
you O
see O
that O
pyramid O
? O
' O
With O
that O
, O
he O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
seemed O
somehow O
, O
in O
some O
queer O
fashion O
, O
to O
swim O
off O
into O
the O
air O
. O
I O
snored O
; O
rolled O
over O
; O
and O
there O
I O
was O
in O
my O
hammock O
! O
Now O
, O
what O
do O
you O
think O
of O
that O
dream O
, O
Flask O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
; O
it O
seems O
a O
sort O
of O
foolish O
to O
me O
, O
tho O
' O
. O
" O
" O
May O
be O
; O
may O
be O
. O
But O
it O
's O
made O
a O
wise O
man O
of O
me O
, O
Flask O
. O
D O
'ye O
see O
Ahab O
standing O
there O
, O
sideways O
looking O
over O
the O
stern O
? O
Well O
, O
the O
best O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
, O
Flask O
, O
is O
to O
let O
that O
old O
man O
alone O
; O
never O
speak O
to O
him O
, O
whatever O
he O
says O
. O
Halloa O
! O
what O
's O
that O
he O
shouts O
? O
Hark O
! O
" O
" O
Mast-head O
, O
there O
! O
Look O
sharp O
, O
all O
of O
ye O
! O
There O
are O
whales O
hereabouts O
! O
If O
ye O
see O
a O
white O
one O
, O
split O
your O
lungs O
for O
him O
! O
" O
" O
What O
d O
'ye O
think O
of O
that O
now O
, O
Flask O
? O
ai O
n't O
there O
a O
small O
drop O
of O
something O
queer O
about O
that O
, O
eh O
? O
A O
white O
whale—did O
ye O
mark O
that O
, O
man O
? O
Look O
ye—there O
's O
something O
special O
in O
the O
wind O
. O
Stand O
by O
for O
it O
, O
Flask O
. O
Ahab O
has O
that O
that O
's O
bloody O
on O
his O
mind O
. O
But O
, O
mum O
; O
he O
comes O
this O
way O
. O
