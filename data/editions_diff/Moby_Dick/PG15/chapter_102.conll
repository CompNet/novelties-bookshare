Hitherto O
, O
in O
descriptively O
treating O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
I O
have O
chiefly O
dwelt O
upon O
the O
marvels O
of O
his O
outer O
aspect O
; O
or O
separately O
and O
in O
detail O
upon O
some O
few O
interior O
structural O
features O
. O
But O
to O
a O
large O
and O
thorough O
sweeping O
comprehension O
of O
him O
, O
it O
behoves O
me O
now O
to O
unbutton O
him O
still O
further O
, O
and O
untagging O
the O
points O
of O
his O
hose O
, O
unbuckling O
his O
garters O
, O
and O
casting O
loose O
the O
hooks O
and O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
joints O
of O
his O
innermost O
bones O
, O
set O
him O
before O
you O
in O
his O
ultimatum O
; O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
in O
his O
unconditional O
skeleton O
. O
But O
how O
now O
, O
Ishmael O
? O
How O
is O
it O
, O
that O
you O
, O
a O
mere O
oarsman O
in O
the O
fishery O
, O
pretend O
to O
know O
aught O
about O
the O
subterranean O
parts O
of O
the O
whale O
? O
Did O
erudite O
Stubb O
, O
mounted O
upon O
your O
capstan O
, O
deliver O
lectures O
on O
the O
anatomy O
of O
the O
Cetacea O
; O
and O
by O
help O
of O
the O
windlass O
, O
hold O
up O
a O
specimen O
rib O
for O
exhibition O
? O
Explain O
thyself O
, O
Ishmael O
. O
Can O
you O
land O
a O
full-grown O
whale O
on O
your O
deck O
for O
examination O
, O
as O
a O
cook O
dishes O
a O
roast-pig O
? O
Surely O
not O
. O
A O
veritable O
witness O
have O
you O
hitherto O
been O
, O
Ishmael O
; O
but O
have O
a O
care O
how O
you O
seize O
the O
privilege O
of O
Jonah O
alone O
; O
the O
privilege O
of O
discoursing O
upon O
the O
joists O
and O
beams O
; O
the O
rafters O
, O
ridge-pole O
, O
sleepers O
, O
and O
under-pinnings O
, O
making O
up O
the O
frame-work O
of O
leviathan O
; O
and O
belike O
of O
the O
tallow-vats O
, O
dairy-rooms O
, O
butteries O
, O
and O
cheeseries O
in O
his O
bowels O
. O
I O
confess O
, O
that O
since O
Jonah O
, O
few O
whalemen O
have O
penetrated O
very O
far O
beneath O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
adult O
whale O
; O
nevertheless O
, O
I O
have O
been O
blessed O
with O
an O
opportunity O
to O
dissect O
him O
in O
miniature O
. O
In O
a O
ship O
I O
belonged O
to O
, O
a O
small O
cub O
Sperm O
Whale O
was O
once O
bodily O
hoisted O
to O
the O
deck O
for O
his O
poke O
or O
bag O
, O
to O
make O
sheaths O
for O
the O
barbs O
of O
the O
harpoons O
, O
and O
for O
the O
heads O
of O
the O
lances O
. O
Think O
you O
I O
let O
that O
chance O
go O
, O
without O
using O
my O
boat-hatchet O
and O
jack-knife O
, O
and O
breaking O
the O
seal O
and O
reading O
all O
the O
contents O
of O
that O
young O
cub O
? O
And O
as O
for O
my O
exact O
knowledge O
of O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
leviathan O
in O
their O
gigantic O
, O
full O
grown O
development O
, O
for O
that O
rare O
knowledge O
I O
am O
indebted O
to O
my O
late O
royal O
friend O
Tranquo O
, O
king O
of O
Tranque O
, O
one O
of O
the O
Arsacides O
. O
For O
being O
at O
Tranque O
, O
years O
ago O
, O
when O
attached O
to O
the O
trading-ship O
Dey O
of O
Algiers O
, O
I O
was O
invited O
to O
spend O
part O
of O
the O
Arsacidean O
holidays O
with O
the O
lord O
of O
Tranque O
, O
at O
his O
retired O
palm O
villa O
at O
Pupella O
; O
a O
sea-side O
glen O
not O
very O
far O
distant O
from O
what O
our O
sailors O
called O
Bamboo-Town O
, O
his O
capital O
. O
Among O
many O
other O
fine O
qualities O
, O
my O
royal O
friend O
Tranquo O
, O
being O
gifted O
with O
a O
devout O
love O
for O
all O
matters O
of O
barbaric O
vertù O
, O
had O
brought O
together O
in O
Pupella O
whatever O
rare O
things O
the O
more O
ingenious O
of O
his O
people O
could O
invent O
; O
chiefly O
carved O
woods O
of O
wonderful O
devices O
, O
chiselled O
shells O
, O
inlaid O
spears O
, O
costly O
paddles O
, O
aromatic O
canoes O
; O
and O
all O
these O
distributed O
among O
whatever O
natural O
wonders O
, O
the O
wonder-freighted O
, O
tribute-rendering O
waves O
had O
cast O
upon O
his O
shores O
. O
Chief O
among O
these O
latter O
was O
a O
great O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
which O
, O
after O
an O
unusually O
long O
raging O
gale O
, O
had O
been O
found O
dead O
and O
stranded O
, O
with O
his O
head O
against O
a O
cocoa-nut O
tree O
, O
whose O
plumage-like O
, O
tufted O
droopings O
seemed O
his O
verdant O
jet O
. O
When O
the O
vast O
body O
had O
at O
last O
been O
stripped O
of O
its O
fathom-deep O
enfoldings O
, O
and O
the O
bones O
become O
dust O
dry O
in O
the O
sun O
, O
then O
the O
skeleton O
was O
carefully O
transported O
up O
the O
Pupella O
glen O
, O
where O
a O
grand O
temple O
of O
lordly O
palms O
now O
sheltered O
it O
. O
The O
ribs O
were O
hung O
with O
trophies O
; O
the O
vertebræ O
were O
carved O
with O
Arsacidean O
annals O
, O
in O
strange O
hieroglyphics O
; O
in O
the O
skull O
, O
the O
priests O
kept O
up O
an O
unextinguished O
aromatic O
flame O
, O
so O
that O
the O
mystic O
head O
again O
sent O
forth O
its O
vapory O
spout O
; O
while O
, O
suspended O
from O
a O
bough O
, O
the O
terrific O
lower O
jaw O
vibrated O
over O
all O
the O
devotees O
, O
like O
the O
hair-hung O
sword O
that O
so O
affrighted O
Damocles O
. O
It O
was O
a O
wondrous O
sight O
. O
The O
wood O
was O
green O
as O
mosses O
of O
the O
Icy O
Glen O
; O
the O
trees O
stood O
high O
and O
haughty O
, O
feeling O
their O
living O
sap O
; O
the O
industrious O
earth O
beneath O
was O
as O
a O
weaver O
's O
loom O
, O
with O
a O
gorgeous O
carpet O
on O
it O
, O
whereof O
the O
ground-vine O
tendrils O
formed O
the O
warp O
and O
woof O
, O
and O
the O
living O
flowers O
the O
figures O
. O
All O
the O
trees O
, O
with O
all O
their O
laden O
branches O
; O
all O
the O
shrubs O
, O
and O
ferns O
, O
and O
grasses O
; O
the O
message-carrying O
air O
; O
all O
these O
unceasingly O
were O
active O
. O
Through O
the O
lacings O
of O
the O
leaves O
, O
the O
great O
sun O
seemed O
a O
flying O
shuttle O
weaving O
the O
unwearied O
verdure O
. O
Oh O
, O
busy O
weaver O
! O
unseen O
weaver O
! O
—pause O
! O
—one O
word O
! O
—whither O
flows O
the O
fabric O
? O
what O
palace O
may O
it O
deck O
? O
wherefore O
all O
these O
ceaseless O
toilings O
? O
Speak O
, O
weaver O
! O
—stay O
thy O
hand O
! O
—but O
one O
single O
word O
with O
thee O
! O
Nay—the O
shuttle O
flies—the O
figures O
float O
from O
forth O
the O
loom O
; O
the O
freshet-rushing O
carpet O
for O
ever O
slides O
away O
. O
The O
weaver-god O
, O
he O
weaves O
; O
and O
by O
that O
weaving O
is O
he O
deafened O
, O
that O
he O
hears O
no O
mortal O
voice O
; O
and O
by O
that O
humming O
, O
we O
, O
too O
, O
who O
look O
on O
the O
loom O
are O
deafened O
; O
and O
only O
when O
we O
escape O
it O
shall O
we O
hear O
the O
thousand O
voices O
that O
speak O
through O
it O
. O
For O
even O
so O
it O
is O
in O
all O
material O
factories O
. O
The O
spoken O
words O
that O
are O
inaudible O
among O
the O
flying O
spindles O
; O
those O
same O
words O
are O
plainly O
heard O
without O
the O
walls O
, O
bursting O
from O
the O
opened O
casements O
. O
Thereby O
have O
villanies O
been O
detected O
. O
Ah O
, O
mortal O
! O
then O
, O
be O
heedful O
; O
for O
so O
, O
in O
all O
this O
din O
of O
the O
great O
world O
's O
loom O
, O
thy O
subtlest O
thinkings O
may O
be O
overheard O
afar O
. O
Now O
, O
amid O
the O
green O
, O
life-restless O
loom O
of O
that O
Arsacidean O
wood O
, O
the O
great O
, O
white O
, O
worshipped O
skeleton O
lay O
lounging—a O
gigantic O
idler O
! O
Yet O
, O
as O
the O
ever-woven O
verdant O
warp O
and O
woof O
intermixed O
and O
hummed O
around O
him O
, O
the O
mighty O
idler O
seemed O
the O
cunning O
weaver O
; O
himself O
all O
woven O
over O
with O
the O
vines O
; O
every O
month O
assuming O
greener O
, O
fresher O
verdure O
; O
but O
himself O
a O
skeleton O
. O
Life O
folded O
Death O
; O
Death O
trellised O
Life O
; O
the O
grim O
god O
wived O
with O
youthful O
Life O
, O
and O
begat O
him O
curly-headed O
glories O
. O
Now O
, O
when O
with O
royal O
Tranquo O
I O
visited O
this O
wondrous O
whale O
, O
and O
saw O
the O
skull O
an O
altar O
, O
and O
the O
artificial O
smoke O
ascending O
from O
where O
the O
real O
jet O
had O
issued O
, O
I O
marvelled O
that O
the O
king O
should O
regard O
a O
chapel O
as O
an O
object O
of O
vertù O
. O
He O
laughed O
. O
But O
more O
I O
marvelled O
that O
the O
priests O
should O
swear O
that O
smoky O
jet O
of O
his O
was O
genuine O
. O
To O
and O
fro O
I O
paced O
before O
this O
skeleton—brushed O
the O
vines O
aside—broke O
through O
the O
ribs—and O
with O
a O
ball O
of O
Arsacidean O
twine O
, O
wandered O
, O
eddied O
long O
amid O
its O
many O
winding O
, O
shaded O
colonnades O
and O
arbors O
. O
But O
soon O
my O
line O
was O
out O
; O
and O
following O
it O
back O
, O
I O
emerged O
from O
the O
opening O
where O
I O
entered O
. O
I O
saw O
no O
living O
thing O
within O
; O
naught O
was O
there O
but O
bones O
. O
Cutting O
me O
a O
green O
measuring-rod O
, O
I O
once O
more O
dived O
within O
the O
skeleton O
. O
From O
their O
arrow-slit O
in O
the O
skull O
, O
the O
priests O
perceived O
me O
taking O
the O
altitude O
of O
the O
final O
rib O
. O
" O
How O
now O
! O
" O
they O
shouted O
; O
" O
Dar'st O
thou O
measure O
this O
our O
god O
! O
That O
's O
for O
us O
. O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
priests—well O
, O
how O
long O
do O
ye O
make O
him O
, O
then O
? O
" O
But O
hereupon O
a O
fierce O
contest O
rose O
among O
them O
, O
concerning O
feet O
and O
inches O
; O
they O
cracked O
each O
other O
's O
sconces O
with O
their O
yard-sticks—the O
great O
skull O
echoed—and O
seizing O
that O
lucky O
chance O
, O
I O
quickly O
concluded O
my O
own O
admeasurements O
. O
These O
admeasurements O
I O
now O
propose O
to O
set O
before O
you O
. O
But O
first O
, O
be O
it O
recorded O
, O
that O
, O
in O
this O
matter O
, O
I O
am O
not O
free O
to O
utter O
any O
fancied O
measurement O
I O
please O
. O
Because O
there O
are O
skeleton O
authorities O
you O
can O
refer O
to O
, O
to O
test O
my O
accuracy O
. O
There O
is O
a O
Leviathanic O
Museum O
, O
they O
tell O
me O
, O
in O
Hull O
, O
England O
, O
one O
of O
the O
whaling O
ports O
of O
that O
country O
, O
where O
they O
have O
some O
fine O
specimens O
of O
fin-backs O
and O
other O
whales O
. O
Likewise O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
in O
the O
museum O
of O
Manchester O
, O
in O
New O
Hampshire O
, O
they O
have O
what O
the O
proprietors O
call O
" O
the O
only O
perfect O
specimen O
of O
a O
Greenland O
or O
River O
Whale O
in O
the O
United O
States O
. O
" O
Moreover O
, O
at O
a O
place O
in O
Yorkshire O
, O
England O
, O
Burton O
Constable O
by O
name O
, O
a O
certain O
Sir O
Clifford O
Constable O
has O
in O
his O
possession O
the O
skeleton O
of O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
but O
of O
moderate O
size O
, O
by O
no O
means O
of O
the O
full-grown O
magnitude O
of O
my O
friend O
King O
Tranquo O
's O
. O
In O
both O
cases O
, O
the O
stranded O
whales O
to O
which O
these O
two O
skeletons O
belonged O
, O
were O
originally O
claimed O
by O
their O
proprietors O
upon O
similar O
grounds O
. O
King O
Tranquo O
seizing O
his O
because O
he O
wanted O
it O
; O
and O
Sir O
Clifford O
, O
because O
he O
was O
lord O
of O
the O
seignories O
of O
those O
parts O
. O
Sir O
Clifford O
's O
whale O
has O
been O
articulated O
throughout O
; O
so O
that O
, O
like O
a O
great O
chest O
of O
drawers O
, O
you O
can O
open O
and O
shut O
him O
, O
in O
all O
his O
bony O
cavities—spread O
out O
his O
ribs O
like O
a O
gigantic O
fan—and O
swing O
all O
day O
upon O
his O
lower O
jaw O
. O
Locks O
are O
to O
be O
put O
upon O
some O
of O
his O
trap-doors O
and O
shutters O
; O
and O
a O
footman O
will O
show O
round O
future O
visitors O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
keys O
at O
his O
side O
. O
Sir O
Clifford O
thinks O
of O
charging O
twopence O
for O
a O
peep O
at O
the O
whispering O
gallery O
in O
the O
spinal O
column O
; O
threepence O
to O
hear O
the O
echo O
in O
the O
hollow O
of O
his O
cerebellum O
; O
and O
sixpence O
for O
the O
unrivalled O
view O
from O
his O
forehead O
. O
The O
skeleton O
dimensions O
I O
shall O
now O
proceed O
to O
set O
down O
are O
copied O
verbatim O
from O
my O
right O
arm O
, O
where O
I O
had O
them O
tattooed O
; O
as O
in O
my O
wild O
wanderings O
at O
that O
period O
, O
there O
was O
no O
other O
secure O
way O
of O
preserving O
such O
valuable O
statistics O
. O
But O
as O
I O
was O
crowded O
for O
space O
, O
and O
wished O
the O
other O
parts O
of O
my O
body O
to O
remain O
a O
blank O
page O
for O
a O
poem O
I O
was O
then O
composing—at O
least O
, O
what O
untattooed O
parts O
might O
remain—I O
did O
not O
trouble O
myself O
with O
the O
odd O
inches O
; O
nor O
, O
indeed O
, O
should O
inches O
at O
all O
enter O
into O
a O
congenial O
admeasurement O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
