As O
Queequeg O
's O
Ramadan O
, O
or O
Fasting O
and O
Humiliation O
, O
was O
to O
continue O
all O
day O
, O
I O
did O
not O
choose O
to O
disturb O
him O
till O
towards O
night-fall O
; O
for O
I O
cherish O
the O
greatest O
respect O
towards O
everybody O
's O
religious O
obligations O
, O
never O
mind O
how O
comical O
, O
and O
could O
not O
find O
it O
in O
my O
heart O
to O
undervalue O
even O
a O
congregation O
of O
ants O
worshipping O
a O
toad-stool O
; O
or O
those O
other O
creatures O
in O
certain O
parts O
of O
our O
earth O
, O
who O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
footmanism O
quite O
unprecedented O
in O
other O
planets O
, O
bow O
down O
before O
the O
torso O
of O
a O
deceased O
landed O
proprietor O
merely O
on O
account O
of O
the O
inordinate O
possessions O
yet O
owned O
and O
rented O
in O
his O
name O
. O
I O
say O
, O
we O
good O
Presbyterian O
Christians O
should O
be O
charitable O
in O
these O
things O
, O
and O
not O
fancy O
ourselves O
so O
vastly O
superior O
to O
other O
mortals O
, O
pagans O
and O
what O
not O
, O
because O
of O
their O
half-crazy O
conceits O
on O
these O
subjects O
. O
There O
was O
Queequeg O
, O
now O
, O
certainly O
entertaining O
the O
most O
absurd O
notions O
about O
Yojo O
and O
his O
Ramadan O
; O
—but O
what O
of O
that O
? O
Queequeg O
thought O
he O
knew O
what O
he O
was O
about O
, O
I O
suppose O
; O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
content O
; O
and O
there O
let O
him O
rest O
. O
All O
our O
arguing O
with O
him O
would O
not O
avail O
; O
let O
him O
be O
, O
I O
say O
: O
and O
Heaven O
have O
mercy O
on O
us O
all—Presbyterians O
and O
Pagans O
alike—for O
we O
are O
all O
somehow O
dreadfully O
cracked O
about O
the O
head O
, O
and O
sadly O
need O
mending O
. O
Towards O
evening O
, O
when O
I O
felt O
assured O
that O
all O
his O
performances O
and O
rituals O
must O
be O
over O
, O
I O
went O
up O
to O
his O
room O
and O
knocked O
at O
the O
door O
; O
but O
no O
answer O
. O
I O
tried O
to O
open O
it O
, O
but O
it O
was O
fastened O
inside O
. O
" O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
said O
I O
softly O
through O
the O
key-hole O
: O
—all O
silent O
. O
" O
I O
say O
, O
Queequeg O
! O
why O
do O
n't O
you O
speak O
? O
It O
's O
I—Ishmael O
. O
" O
But O
all O
remained O
still O
as O
before O
. O
I O
began O
to O
grow O
alarmed O
. O
I O
had O
allowed O
him O
such O
abundant O
time O
; O
I O
thought O
he O
might O
have O
had O
an O
apoplectic O
fit O
. O
I O
looked O
through O
the O
key-hole O
; O
but O
the O
door O
opening O
into O
an O
odd O
corner O
of O
the O
room O
, O
the O
key-hole O
prospect O
was O
but O
a O
crooked O
and O
sinister O
one O
. O
I O
could O
only O
see O
part O
of O
the O
foot-board O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
a O
line O
of O
the O
wall O
, O
but O
nothing O
more O
. O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
behold O
resting O
against O
the O
wall O
the O
wooden O
shaft O
of O
Queequeg O
's O
harpoon O
, O
which O
the O
landlady O
the O
evening O
previous O
had O
taken O
from O
him O
, O
before O
our O
mounting O
to O
the O
chamber O
. O
That O
's O
strange O
, O
thought O
I O
; O
but O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
since O
the O
harpoon O
stands O
yonder O
, O
and O
he O
seldom O
or O
never O
goes O
abroad O
without O
it O
, O
therefore O
he O
must O
be O
inside O
here O
, O
and O
no O
possible O
mistake O
. O
" O
Queequeg O
! O
—Queequeg O
! O
" O
—all O
still O
. O
Something O
must O
have O
happened O
. O
Apoplexy O
! O
I O
tried O
to O
burst O
open O
the O
door O
; O
but O
it O
stubbornly O
resisted O
. O
Running O
down O
stairs O
, O
I O
quickly O
stated O
my O
suspicions O
to O
the O
first O
person O
I O
met—the O
chamber-maid O
. O
" O
La O
! O
la O
! O
" O
she O
cried O
, O
" O
I O
thought O
something O
must O
be O
the O
matter O
. O
I O
went O
to O
make O
the O
bed O
after O
breakfast O
, O
and O
the O
door O
was O
locked O
; O
and O
not O
a O
mouse O
to O
be O
heard O
; O
and O
it O
's O
been O
just O
so O
silent O
ever O
since O
. O
But O
I O
thought O
, O
may O
be O
, O
you O
had O
both O
gone O
off O
and O
locked O
your O
baggage O
in O
for O
safe O
keeping O
. O
La O
! O
la O
, O
ma'am O
! O
—Mistress O
! O
murder O
! O
Mrs O
. O
Hussey O
! O
apoplexy O
! O
" O
—and O
with O
these O
cries O
, O
she O
ran O
towards O
the O
kitchen O
, O
I O
following O
. O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
soon O
appeared O
, O
with O
a O
mustard-pot O
in O
one O
hand O
and O
a O
vinegar-cruet O
in O
the O
other O
, O
having O
just O
broken O
away O
from O
the O
occupation O
of O
attending O
to O
the O
castors O
, O
and O
scolding O
her O
little O
black O
boy O
meantime O
. O
" O
Wood-house O
! O
" O
cried O
I O
, O
" O
which O
way O
to O
it O
? O
Run O
for O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
and O
fetch O
something O
to O
pry O
open O
the O
door—the O
axe O
! O
—the O
axe O
! O
he O
's O
had O
a O
stroke O
; O
depend O
upon O
it O
! O
" O
—and O
so O
saying O
I O
was O
unmethodically O
rushing O
up O
stairs O
again O
empty-handed O
, O
when O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
interposed O
the O
mustard-pot O
and O
vinegar-cruet O
, O
and O
the O
entire O
castor O
of O
her O
countenance O
. O
" O
What O
's O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
, O
young O
man O
? O
" O
" O
Get O
the O
axe O
! O
For O
God O
's O
sake O
, O
run O
for O
the O
doctor O
, O
some O
one O
, O
while O
I O
pry O
it O
open O
! O
" O
" O
Look O
here O
, O
" O
said O
the O
landlady O
, O
quickly O
putting O
down O
the O
vinegar-cruet O
, O
so O
as O
to O
have O
one O
hand O
free O
; O
" O
look O
here O
; O
are O
you O
talking O
about O
prying O
open O
any O
of O
my O
doors O
? O
" O
—and O
with O
that O
she O
seized O
my O
arm O
. O
" O
What O
's O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
? O
What O
's O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
, O
shipmate O
? O
" O
In O
as O
calm O
, O
but O
rapid O
a O
manner O
as O
possible O
, O
I O
gave O
her O
to O
understand O
the O
whole O
case O
. O
Unconsciously O
clapping O
the O
vinegar-cruet O
to O
one O
side O
of O
her O
nose O
, O
she O
ruminated O
for O
an O
instant O
; O
then O
exclaimed— O
" O
No O
! O
I O
have O
n't O
seen O
it O
since O
I O
put O
it O
there O
. O
" O
Running O
to O
a O
little O
closet O
under O
the O
landing O
of O
the O
stairs O
, O
she O
glanced O
in O
, O
and O
returning O
, O
told O
me O
that O
Queequeg O
's O
harpoon O
was O
missing O
. O
" O
He O
's O
killed O
himself O
, O
" O
she O
cried O
. O
" O
It O
's O
unfort'nate O
Stiggs O
done O
over O
again—there O
goes O
another O
counterpane—God O
pity O
his O
poor O
mother O
! O
—it O
will O
be O
the O
ruin O
of O
my O
house O
. O
Has O
the O
poor O
lad O
a O
sister O
? O
Where O
's O
that O
girl O
? O
—there O
, O
Betty O
, O
go O
to O
Snarles O
the O
Painter O
, O
and O
tell O
him O
to O
paint O
me O
a O
sign O
, O
with— O
" O
no O
suicides O
permitted O
here O
, O
and O
no O
smoking O
in O
the O
parlor O
; O
" O
—might O
as O
well O
kill O
both O
birds O
at O
once O
. O
Kill O
? O
The O
Lord O
be O
merciful O
to O
his O
ghost O
! O
What O
's O
that O
noise O
there O
? O
You O
, O
young O
man O
, O
avast O
there O
! O
" O
And O
running O
up O
after O
me O
, O
she O
caught O
me O
as O
I O
was O
again O
trying O
to O
force O
open O
the O
door O
. O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
allow O
it O
; O
I O
wo O
n't O
have O
my O
premises O
spoiled O
. O
Go O
for O
the O
locksmith O
, O
there O
's O
one O
about O
a O
mile O
from O
here O
. O
But O
avast O
! O
" O
putting O
her O
hand O
in O
her O
side-pocket O
, O
" O
here O
's O
a O
key O
that O
'll O
fit O
, O
I O
guess O
; O
let O
's O
see O
. O
" O
And O
with O
that O
, O
she O
turned O
it O
in O
the O
lock O
; O
but O
, O
alas O
! O
Queequeg O
's O
supplemental O
bolt O
remained O
unwithdrawn O
within O
. O
" O
Have O
to O
burst O
it O
open O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
and O
was O
running O
down O
the O
entry O
a O
little O
, O
for O
a O
good O
start O
, O
when O
the O
landlady O
caught O
at O
me O
, O
again O
vowing O
I O
should O
not O
break O
down O
her O
premises O
; O
but O
I O
tore O
from O
her O
, O
and O
with O
a O
sudden O
bodily O
rush O
dashed O
myself O
full O
against O
the O
mark O
. O
With O
a O
prodigious O
noise O
the O
door O
flew O
open O
, O
and O
the O
knob O
slamming O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
sent O
the O
plaster O
to O
the O
ceiling O
; O
and O
there O
, O
good O
heavens O
! O
there O
sat O
Queequeg O
, O
altogether O
cool O
and O
self-collected O
; O
right O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
room O
; O
squatting O
on O
his O
hams O
, O
and O
holding O
Yojo O
on O
top O
of O
his O
head O
. O
He O
looked O
neither O
one O
way O
nor O
the O
other O
way O
, O
but O
sat O
like O
a O
carved O
image O
with O
scarce O
a O
sign O
of O
active O
life O
. O
" O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
going O
up O
to O
him O
, O
" O
Queequeg O
, O
what O
's O
the O
matter O
with O
you O
? O
" O
" O
He O
hai O
n't O
been O
a O
sittin O
' O
so O
all O
day O
, O
has O
he O
? O
" O
said O
the O
landlady O
. O
But O
all O
we O
said O
, O
not O
a O
word O
could O
we O
drag O
out O
of O
him O
; O
I O
almost O
felt O
like O
pushing O
him O
over O
, O
so O
as O
to O
change O
his O
position O
, O
for O
it O
was O
almost O
intolerable O
, O
it O
seemed O
so O
painfully O
and O
unnaturally O
constrained O
; O
especially O
, O
as O
in O
all O
probability O
he O
had O
been O
sitting O
so O
for O
upwards O
of O
eight O
or O
ten O
hours O
, O
going O
too O
without O
his O
regular O
meals O
. O
" O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
he O
's O
_alive_ O
at O
all O
events O
; O
so O
leave O
us O
, O
if O
you O
please O
, O
and O
I O
will O
see O
to O
this O
strange O
affair O
myself O
. O
" O
Closing O
the O
door O
upon O
the O
landlady O
, O
I O
endeavored O
to O
prevail O
upon O
Queequeg O
to O
take O
a O
chair O
; O
but O
in O
vain O
. O
There O
he O
sat O
; O
and O
all O
he O
could O
do—for O
all O
my O
polite O
arts O
and O
blandishments—he O
would O
not O
move O
a O
peg O
, O
nor O
say O
a O
single O
word O
, O
nor O
even O
look O
at O
me O
, O
nor O
notice O
my O
presence O
in O
the O
slightest O
way O
. O
I O
wonder O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
if O
this O
can O
possibly O
be O
a O
part O
of O
his O
Ramadan O
; O
do O
they O
fast O
on O
their O
hams O
that O
way O
in O
his O
native O
island O
. O
It O
must O
be O
so O
; O
yes O
, O
it O
's O
part O
of O
his O
creed O
, O
I O
suppose O
; O
well O
, O
then O
, O
let O
him O
rest O
; O
he O
'll O
get O
up O
sooner O
or O
later O
, O
no O
doubt O
. O
It O
ca O
n't O
last O
for O
ever O
, O
thank O
God O
, O
and O
his O
Ramadan O
only O
comes O
once O
a O
year O
; O
and O
I O
do O
n't O
believe O
it O
's O
very O
punctual O
then O
. O
I O
went O
down O
to O
supper O
. O
After O
sitting O
a O
long O
time O
listening O
to O
the O
long O
stories O
of O
some O
sailors O
who O
had O
just O
come O
from O
a O
plum-pudding O
voyage O
, O
as O
they O
called O
it O
( O
that O
is O
, O
a O
short O
whaling-voyage O
in O
a O
schooner O
or O
brig O
, O
confined O
to O
the O
north O
of O
the O
line O
, O
in O
the O
Atlantic O
Ocean O
only O
) O
; O
after O
listening O
to O
these O
plum-puddingers O
till O
nearly O
eleven O
o'clock O
, O
I O
went O
up O
stairs O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
, O
feeling O
quite O
sure O
by O
this O
time O
Queequeg O
must O
certainly O
have O
brought O
his O
Ramadan O
to O
a O
termination O
. O
But O
no O
; O
there O
he O
was O
just O
where O
I O
had O
left O
him O
; O
he O
had O
not O
stirred O
an O
inch O
. O
I O
began O
to O
grow O
vexed O
with O
him O
; O
it O
seemed O
so O
downright O
senseless O
and O
insane O
to O
be O
sitting O
there O
all O
day O
and O
half O
the O
night O
on O
his O
hams O
in O
a O
cold O
room O
, O
holding O
a O
piece O
of O
wood O
on O
his O
head O
. O
" O
For O
heaven O
's O
sake O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
get O
up O
and O
shake O
yourself O
; O
get O
up O
and O
have O
some O
supper O
. O
You O
'll O
starve O
; O
you O
'll O
kill O
yourself O
, O
Queequeg O
. O
" O
But O
not O
a O
word O
did O
he O
reply O
. O
Despairing O
of O
him O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
determined O
to O
go O
to O
bed O
and O
to O
sleep O
; O
and O
no O
doubt O
, O
before O
a O
great O
while O
, O
he O
would O
follow O
me O
. O
But O
previous O
to O
turning O
in O
, O
I O
took O
my O
heavy O
bearskin O
jacket O
, O
and O
threw O
it O
over O
him O
, O
as O
it O
promised O
to O
be O
a O
very O
cold O
night O
; O
and O
he O
had O
nothing O
but O
his O
ordinary O
round O
jacket O
on O
. O
For O
some O
time O
, O
do O
all O
I O
would O
, O
I O
could O
not O
get O
into O
the O
faintest O
doze O
. O
I O
had O
blown O
out O
the O
candle O
; O
and O
the O
mere O
thought O
of O
Queequeg—not O
four O
feet O
off—sitting O
there O
in O
that O
uneasy O
position O
, O
stark O
alone O
in O
the O
cold O
and O
dark O
; O
this O
made O
me O
really O
wretched O
. O
Think O
of O
it O
; O
sleeping O
all O
night O
in O
the O
same O
room O
with O
a O
wide O
awake O
pagan O
on O
his O
hams O
in O
this O
dreary O
, O
unaccountable O
Ramadan O
! O
But O
somehow O
I O
dropped O
off O
at O
last O
, O
and O
knew O
nothing O
more O
till O
break O
of O
day O
; O
when O
, O
looking O
over O
the O
bedside O
, O
there O
squatted O
Queequeg O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
been O
screwed O
down O
to O
the O
floor O
. O
But O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
first O
glimpse O
of O
sun O
entered O
the O
window O
, O
up O
he O
got O
, O
with O
stiff O
and O
grating O
joints O
, O
but O
with O
a O
cheerful O
look O
; O
limped O
towards O
me O
where O
I O
lay O
; O
pressed O
his O
forehead O
again O
against O
mine O
; O
and O
said O
his O
Ramadan O
was O
over O
. O
Now O
, O
as O
I O
before O
hinted O
, O
I O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
any O
person O
's O
religion O
, O
be O
it O
what O
it O
may O
, O
so O
long O
as O
that O
person O
does O
not O
kill O
or O
insult O
any O
other O
person O
, O
because O
that O
other O
person O
do O
n't O
believe O
it O
also O
. O
But O
when O
a O
man O
's O
religion O
becomes O
really O
frantic O
; O
when O
it O
is O
a O
positive O
torment O
to O
him O
; O
and O
, O
in O
fine O
, O
makes O
this O
earth O
of O
ours O
an O
uncomfortable O
inn O
to O
lodge O
in O
; O
then O
I O
think O
it O
high O
time O
to O
take O
that O
individual O
aside O
and O
argue O
the O
point O
with O
him O
. O
And O
just O
so O
I O
now O
did O
with O
Queequeg O
. O
" O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
get O
into O
bed O
now O
, O
and O
lie O
and O
listen O
to O
me O
. O
" O
I O
then O
went O
on O
, O
beginning O
with O
the O
rise O
and O
progress O
of O
the O
primitive O
religions O
, O
and O
coming O
down O
to O
the O
various O
religions O
of O
the O
present O
time O
, O
during O
which O
time O
I O
labored O
to O
show O
Queequeg O
that O
all O
these O
Lents O
, O
Ramadans O
, O
and O
prolonged O
ham-squattings O
in O
cold O
, O
cheerless O
rooms O
were O
stark O
nonsense O
; O
bad O
for O
the O
health O
; O
useless O
for O
the O
soul O
; O
opposed O
, O
in O
short O
, O
to O
the O
obvious O
laws O
of O
Hygiene O
and O
common O
sense O
. O
I O
told O
him O
, O
too O
, O
that O
he O
being O
in O
other O
things O
such O
an O
extremely O
sensible O
and O
sagacious O
savage O
, O
it O
pained O
me O
, O
very O
badly O
pained O
me O
, O
to O
see O
him O
now O
so O
deplorably O
foolish O
about O
this O
ridiculous O
Ramadan O
of O
his O
. O
Besides O
, O
argued O
I O
, O
fasting O
makes O
the O
body O
cave O
in O
; O
hence O
the O
spirit O
caves O
in O
; O
and O
all O
thoughts O
born O
of O
a O
fast O
must O
necessarily O
be O
half-starved O
. O
This O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
most O
dyspeptic O
religionists O
cherish O
such O
melancholy O
notions O
about O
their O
hereafters O
. O
In O
one O
word O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
said O
I O
, O
rather O
digressively O
; O
hell O
is O
an O
idea O
first O
born O
on O
an O
undigested O
apple-dumpling O
; O
and O
since O
then O
perpetuated O
through O
the O
hereditary O
dyspepsias O
nurtured O
by O
Ramadans O
. O
I O
then O
asked O
Queequeg O
whether O
he O
himself O
was O
ever O
troubled O
with O
dyspepsia O
; O
expressing O
the O
idea O
very O
plainly O
, O
so O
that O
he O
could O
take O
it O
in O
. O
He O
said O
no O
; O
only O
upon O
one O
memorable O
occasion O
. O
It O
was O
after O
a O
great O
feast O
given O
by O
his O
father O
the O
king O
, O
on O
the O
gaining O
of O
a O
great O
battle O
wherein O
fifty O
of O
the O
enemy O
had O
been O
killed O
by O
about O
two O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
, O
and O
all O
cooked O
and O
eaten O
that O
very O
evening O
. O
" O
No O
more O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
shuddering O
; O
" O
that O
will O
do O
; O
" O
for O
I O
knew O
the O
inferences O
without O
his O
further O
hinting O
them O
. O
I O
had O
seen O
a O
sailor O
who O
had O
visited O
that O
very O
island O
, O
and O
he O
told O
me O
that O
it O
was O
the O
custom O
, O
when O
a O
great O
battle O
had O
been O
gained O
there O
, O
to O
barbecue O
all O
the O
slain O
in O
the O
yard O
or O
garden O
of O
the O
victor O
; O
and O
then O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
they O
were O
placed O
in O
great O
wooden O
trenchers O
, O
and O
garnished O
round O
like O
a O
pilau O
, O
with O
breadfruit O
and O
cocoanuts O
; O
and O
with O
some O
parsley O
in O
their O
mouths O
, O
were O
sent O
round O
with O
the O
victor O
's O
compliments O
to O
all O
his O
friends O
, O
just O
as O
though O
these O
presents O
were O
so O
many O
Christmas O
turkeys O
. O
After O
all O
, O
I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
my O
remarks O
about O
religion O
made O
much O
impression O
upon O
Queequeg O
. O
Because O
, O
in O
the O
first O
place O
, O
he O
somehow O
seemed O
dull O
of O
hearing O
on O
that O
important O
subject O
, O
unless O
considered O
from O
his O
own O
point O
of O
view O
; O
and O
, O
in O
the O
second O
place O
, O
he O
did O
not O
more O
than O
one O
third O
understand O
me O
, O
couch O
my O
ideas O
simply O
as O
I O
would O
; O
and O
, O
finally O
, O
he O
no O
doubt O
thought O
he O
knew O
a O
good O
deal O
more O
about O
the O
true O
religion O
than O
I O
did O
. O
He O
looked O
at O
me O
with O
a O
sort O
of O
condescending O
concern O
and O
compassion O
, O
as O
though O
he O
thought O
it O
a O
great O
pity O
that O
such O
a O
sensible O
young O
man O
should O
be O
so O
hopelessly O
lost O
to O
evangelical O
pagan O
piety O
. O
At O
last O
we O
rose O
and O
dressed O
; O
and O
Queequeg O
, O
taking O
a O
prodigiously O
hearty O
breakfast O
of O
chowders O
of O
all O
sorts O
, O
so O
that O
the O
landlady O
should O
not O
make O
much O
profit O
by O
reason O
of O
his O
Ramadan O
, O
we O
sallied O
out O
to O
board O
the O
Pequod O
, O
sauntering O
along O
, O
and O
picking O
our O
teeth O
with O
halibut O
bones O
. O
