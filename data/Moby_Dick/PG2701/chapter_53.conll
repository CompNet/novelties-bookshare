The O
ostensible O
reason O
why O
Ahab O
did O
not O
go O
on O
board O
of O
the O
whaler O
we O
had O
spoken O
was O
this O
: O
the O
wind O
and O
sea O
betokened O
storms O
. O
But O
even O
had O
this O
not O
been O
the O
case O
, O
he O
would O
not O
after O
all O
, O
perhaps O
, O
have O
boarded O
her—judging O
by O
his O
subsequent O
conduct O
on O
similar O
occasions—if O
so O
it O
had O
been O
that O
, O
by O
the O
process O
of O
hailing O
, O
he O
had O
obtained O
a O
negative O
answer O
to O
the O
question O
he O
put O
. O
For O
, O
as O
it O
eventually O
turned O
out O
, O
he O
cared O
not O
to O
consort O
, O
even O
for O
five O
minutes O
, O
with O
any O
stranger O
captain O
, O
except O
he O
could O
contribute O
some O
of O
that O
information O
he O
so O
absorbingly O
sought O
. O
But O
all O
this O
might O
remain O
inadequately O
estimated O
, O
were O
not O
something O
said O
here O
of O
the O
peculiar O
usages O
of O
whaling-vessels O
when O
meeting O
each O
other O
in O
foreign O
seas O
, O
and O
especially O
on O
a O
common O
cruising-ground O
. O
If O
two O
strangers O
crossing O
the O
Pine O
Barrens O
in O
New O
York O
State O
, O
or O
the O
equally O
desolate O
Salisbury O
Plain O
in O
England O
; O
if O
casually O
encountering O
each O
other O
in O
such O
inhospitable O
wilds O
, O
these O
twain O
, O
for O
the O
life O
of O
them O
, O
can O
not O
well O
avoid O
a O
mutual O
salutation O
; O
and O
stopping O
for O
a O
moment O
to O
interchange O
the O
news O
; O
and O
, O
perhaps O
, O
sitting O
down O
for O
a O
while O
and O
resting O
in O
concert O
: O
then O
, O
how O
much O
more O
natural O
that O
upon O
the O
illimitable O
Pine O
Barrens O
and O
Salisbury O
Plains O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
two O
whaling O
vessels O
descrying O
each O
other O
at O
the O
ends O
of O
the O
earth—off O
lone O
Fanning O
's O
Island O
, O
or O
the O
far O
away O
King O
's O
Mills O
; O
how O
much O
more O
natural O
, O
I O
say O
, O
that O
under O
such O
circumstances O
these O
ships O
should O
not O
only O
interchange O
hails O
, O
but O
come O
into O
still O
closer O
, O
more O
friendly O
and O
sociable O
contact O
. O
And O
especially O
would O
this O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
matter O
of O
course O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
vessels O
owned O
in O
one O
seaport O
, O
and O
whose O
captains O
, O
officers O
, O
and O
not O
a O
few O
of O
the O
men O
are O
personally O
known O
to O
each O
other O
; O
and O
consequently O
, O
have O
all O
sorts O
of O
dear O
domestic O
things O
to O
talk O
about O
. O
For O
the O
long O
absent O
ship O
, O
the O
outward-bounder O
, O
perhaps O
, O
has O
letters O
on O
board O
; O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
she O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
let O
her O
have O
some O
papers O
of O
a O
date O
a O
year O
or O
two O
later O
than O
the O
last O
one O
on O
her O
blurred O
and O
thumb-worn O
files O
. O
And O
in O
return O
for O
that O
courtesy O
, O
the O
outward-bound O
ship O
would O
receive O
the O
latest O
whaling O
intelligence O
from O
the O
cruising-ground O
to O
which O
she O
may O
be O
destined O
, O
a O
thing O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
to O
her O
. O
And O
in O
degree O
, O
all O
this O
will O
hold O
true O
concerning O
whaling O
vessels O
crossing O
each O
other O
's O
track O
on O
the O
cruising-ground O
itself O
, O
even O
though O
they O
are O
equally O
long O
absent O
from O
home O
. O
For O
one O
of O
them O
may O
have O
received O
a O
transfer O
of O
letters O
from O
some O
third O
, O
and O
now O
far O
remote O
vessel O
; O
and O
some O
of O
those O
letters O
may O
be O
for O
the O
people O
of O
the O
ship O
she O
now O
meets O
. O
Besides O
, O
they O
would O
exchange O
the O
whaling O
news O
, O
and O
have O
an O
agreeable O
chat O
. O
For O
not O
only O
would O
they O
meet O
with O
all O
the O
sympathies O
of O
sailors O
, O
but O
likewise O
with O
all O
the O
peculiar O
congenialities O
arising O
from O
a O
common O
pursuit O
and O
mutually O
shared O
privations O
and O
perils O
. O
Nor O
would O
difference O
of O
country O
make O
any O
very O
essential O
difference O
; O
that O
is O
, O
so O
long O
as O
both O
parties O
speak O
one O
language O
, O
as O
is O
the O
case O
with O
Americans O
and O
English O
. O
Though O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
from O
the O
small O
number O
of O
English O
whalers O
, O
such O
meetings O
do O
not O
very O
often O
occur O
, O
and O
when O
they O
do O
occur O
there O
is O
too O
apt O
to O
be O
a O
sort O
of O
shyness O
between O
them O
; O
for O
your O
Englishman O
is O
rather O
reserved O
, O
and O
your O
Yankee O
, O
he O
does O
not O
fancy O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
in O
anybody O
but O
himself O
. O
Besides O
, O
the O
English O
whalers O
sometimes O
affect O
a O
kind O
of O
metropolitan O
superiority O
over O
the O
American O
whalers O
; O
regarding O
the O
long O
, O
lean O
Nantucketer O
, O
with O
his O
nondescript O
provincialisms O
, O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
sea-peasant O
. O
But O
where O
this O
superiority O
in O
the O
English O
whalemen O
does O
really O
consist O
, O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
say O
, O
seeing O
that O
the O
Yankees O
in O
one O
day O
, O
collectively O
, O
kill O
more O
whales O
than O
all O
the O
English O
, O
collectively O
, O
in O
ten O
years O
. O
But O
this O
is O
a O
harmless O
little O
foible O
in O
the O
English O
whale-hunters O
, O
which O
the O
Nantucketer O
does O
not O
take O
much O
to O
heart O
; O
probably O
, O
because O
he O
knows O
that O
he O
has O
a O
few O
foibles O
himself O
. O
So O
, O
then O
, O
we O
see O
that O
of O
all O
ships O
separately O
sailing O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
whalers O
have O
most O
reason O
to O
be O
sociable—and O
they O
are O
so O
. O
Whereas O
, O
some O
merchant O
ships O
crossing O
each O
other O
's O
wake O
in O
the O
mid-Atlantic O
, O
will O
oftentimes O
pass O
on O
without O
so O
much O
as O
a O
single O
word O
of O
recognition O
, O
mutually O
cutting O
each O
other O
on O
the O
high O
seas O
, O
like O
a O
brace O
of O
dandies O
in O
Broadway O
; O
and O
all O
the O
time O
indulging O
, O
perhaps O
, O
in O
finical O
criticism O
upon O
each O
other O
's O
rig O
. O
As O
for O
Men-of-War O
, O
when O
they O
chance O
to O
meet O
at O
sea O
, O
they O
first O
go O
through O
such O
a O
string O
of O
silly O
bowings O
and O
scrapings O
, O
such O
a O
ducking O
of O
ensigns O
, O
that O
there O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
much O
right-down O
hearty O
good-will O
and O
brotherly O
love O
about O
it O
at O
all O
. O
As O
touching O
Slave-ships O
meeting O
, O
why O
, O
they O
are O
in O
such O
a O
prodigious O
hurry O
, O
they O
run O
away O
from O
each O
other O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
And O
as O
for O
Pirates O
, O
when O
they O
chance O
to O
cross O
each O
other O
's O
cross-bones O
, O
the O
first O
hail O
is— O
" O
How O
many O
skulls O
? O
" O
—the O
same O
way O
that O
whalers O
hail— O
" O
How O
many O
barrels O
? O
" O
And O
that O
question O
once O
answered O
, O
pirates O
straightway O
steer O
apart O
, O
for O
they O
are O
infernal O
villains O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
see O
overmuch O
of O
each O
other O
's O
villanous O
likenesses O
. O
But O
look O
at O
the O
godly O
, O
honest O
, O
unostentatious O
, O
hospitable O
, O
sociable O
, O
free-and-easy O
whaler O
! O
What O
does O
the O
whaler O
do O
when O
she O
meets O
another O
whaler O
in O
any O
sort O
of O
decent O
weather O
? O
She O
has O
a O
" O
_Gam_ O
, O
" O
a O
thing O
so O
utterly O
unknown O
to O
all O
other O
ships O
that O
they O
never O
heard O
of O
the O
name O
even O
; O
and O
if O
by O
chance O
they O
should O
hear O
of O
it O
, O
they O
only O
grin O
at O
it O
, O
and O
repeat O
gamesome O
stuff O
about O
" O
spouters O
" O
and O
" O
blubber-boilers O
, O
" O
and O
such O
like O
pretty O
exclamations O
. O
Why O
it O
is O
that O
all O
Merchant-seamen O
, O
and O
also O
all O
Pirates O
and O
Man-of-War O
's O
men O
, O
and O
Slave-ship O
sailors O
, O
cherish O
such O
a O
scornful O
feeling O
towards O
Whale-ships O
; O
this O
is O
a O
question O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
answer O
. O
Because O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
pirates O
, O
say O
, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
whether O
that O
profession O
of O
theirs O
has O
any O
peculiar O
glory O
about O
it O
. O
It O
sometimes O
ends O
in O
uncommon O
elevation O
, O
indeed O
; O
but O
only O
at O
the O
gallows O
. O
And O
besides O
, O
when O
a O
man O
is O
elevated O
in O
that O
odd O
fashion O
, O
he O
has O
no O
proper O
foundation O
for O
his O
superior O
altitude O
. O
Hence O
, O
I O
conclude O
, O
that O
in O
boasting O
himself O
to O
be O
high O
lifted O
above O
a O
whaleman O
, O
in O
that O
assertion O
the O
pirate O
has O
no O
solid O
basis O
to O
stand O
on O
. O
But O
what O
is O
a O
_Gam O
? O
_ O
You O
might O
wear O
out O
your O
index-finger O
running O
up O
and O
down O
the O
columns O
of O
dictionaries O
, O
and O
never O
find O
the O
word O
. O
Dr O
. O
Johnson O
never O
attained O
to O
that O
erudition O
; O
Noah O
Webster O
's O
ark O
does O
not O
hold O
it O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
this O
same O
expressive O
word O
has O
now O
for O
many O
years O
been O
in O
constant O
use O
among O
some O
fifteen O
thousand O
true O
born O
Yankees O
. O
Certainly O
, O
it O
needs O
a O
definition O
, O
and O
should O
be O
incorporated O
into O
the O
Lexicon O
. O
With O
that O
view O
, O
let O
me O
learnedly O
define O
it O
. O
GAM O
. O
NOUN—_A O
social O
meeting O
of O
two_ O
( O
_or O
more_ O
) O
_Whaleships O
, O
generally O
on O
a O
cruising-ground O
; O
when O
, O
after O
exchanging O
hails O
, O
they O
exchange O
visits O
by O
boats O
' O
crews O
: O
the O
two O
captains O
remaining O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
on O
board O
of O
one O
ship O
, O
and O
the O
two O
chief O
mates O
on O
the O
other._ O
There O
is O
another O
little O
item O
about O
Gamming O
which O
must O
not O
be O
forgotten O
here O
. O
All O
professions O
have O
their O
own O
little O
peculiarities O
of O
detail O
; O
so O
has O
the O
whale O
fishery O
. O
In O
a O
pirate O
, O
man-of-war O
, O
or O
slave O
ship O
, O
when O
the O
captain O
is O
rowed O
anywhere O
in O
his O
boat O
, O
he O
always O
sits O
in O
the O
stern O
sheets O
on O
a O
comfortable O
, O
sometimes O
cushioned O
seat O
there O
, O
and O
often O
steers O
himself O
with O
a O
pretty O
little O
milliner O
's O
tiller O
decorated O
with O
gay O
cords O
and O
ribbons O
. O
But O
the O
whale-boat O
has O
no O
seat O
astern O
, O
no O
sofa O
of O
that O
sort O
whatever O
, O
and O
no O
tiller O
at O
all O
. O
High O
times O
indeed O
, O
if O
whaling O
captains O
were O
wheeled O
about O
the O
water O
on O
castors O
like O
gouty O
old O
aldermen O
in O
patent O
chairs O
. O
And O
as O
for O
a O
tiller O
, O
the O
whale-boat O
never O
admits O
of O
any O
such O
effeminacy O
; O
and O
therefore O
as O
in O
gamming O
a O
complete O
boat O
's O
crew O
must O
leave O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
hence O
as O
the O
boat O
steerer O
or O
harpooneer O
is O
of O
the O
number O
, O
that O
subordinate O
is O
the O
steersman O
upon O
the O
occasion O
, O
and O
the O
captain O
, O
having O
no O
place O
to O
sit O
in O
, O
is O
pulled O
off O
to O
his O
visit O
all O
standing O
like O
a O
pine O
tree O
. O
And O
often O
you O
will O
notice O
that O
being O
conscious O
of O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
whole O
visible O
world O
resting O
on O
him O
from O
the O
sides O
of O
the O
two O
ships O
, O
this O
standing O
captain O
is O
all O
alive O
to O
the O
importance O
of O
sustaining O
his O
dignity O
by O
maintaining O
his O
legs O
. O
Nor O
is O
this O
any O
very O
easy O
matter O
; O
for O
in O
his O
rear O
is O
the O
immense O
projecting O
steering O
oar O
hitting O
him O
now O
and O
then O
in O
the O
small O
of O
his O
back O
, O
the O
after-oar O
reciprocating O
by O
rapping O
his O
knees O
in O
front O
. O
He O
is O
thus O
completely O
wedged O
before O
and O
behind O
, O
and O
can O
only O
expand O
himself O
sideways O
by O
settling O
down O
on O
his O
stretched O
legs O
; O
but O
a O
sudden O
, O
violent O
pitch O
of O
the O
boat O
will O
often O
go O
far O
to O
topple O
him O
, O
because O
length O
of O
foundation O
is O
nothing O
without O
corresponding O
breadth O
. O
Merely O
make O
a O
spread O
angle O
of O
two O
poles O
, O
and O
you O
can O
not O
stand O
them O
up O
. O
Then O
, O
again O
, O
it O
would O
never O
do O
in O
plain O
sight O
of O
the O
world O
's O
riveted O
eyes O
, O
it O
would O
never O
do O
, O
I O
say O
, O
for O
this O
straddling O
captain O
to O
be O
seen O
steadying O
himself O
the O
slightest O
particle O
by O
catching O
hold O
of O
anything O
with O
his O
hands O
; O
indeed O
, O
as O
token O
of O
his O
entire O
, O
buoyant O
self-command O
, O
he O
generally O
carries O
his O
hands O
in O
his O
trowsers O
' O
pockets O
; O
but O
perhaps O
being O
generally O
very O
large O
, O
heavy O
hands O
, O
he O
carries O
them O
there O
for O
ballast O
. O
Nevertheless O
there O
have O
occurred O
instances O
, O
well O
authenticated O
ones O
too O
, O
where O
the O
captain O
has O
been O
known O
for O
an O
uncommonly O
critical O
moment O
or O
two O
, O
in O
a O
sudden O
squall O
say—to O
seize O
hold O
of O
the O
nearest O
oarsman O
's O
hair O
, O
and O
hold O
on O
there O
like O
grim O
death O
. O
