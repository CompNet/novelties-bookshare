That O
night O
, O
in O
the O
mid-watch O
, O
when O
the O
old O
man—as O
his O
wont O
at O
intervals—stepped O
forth O
from O
the O
scuttle O
in O
which O
he O
leaned O
, O
and O
went O
to O
his O
pivot-hole O
, O
he O
suddenly O
thrust O
out O
his O
face O
fiercely O
, O
snuffing O
up O
the O
sea O
air O
as O
a O
sagacious O
ship O
's O
dog O
will O
, O
in O
drawing O
nigh O
to O
some O
barbarous O
isle O
. O
He O
declared O
that O
a O
whale O
must O
be O
near O
. O
Soon O
that O
peculiar O
odor O
, O
sometimes O
to O
a O
great O
distance O
given O
forth O
by O
the O
living O
sperm O
whale O
, O
was O
palpable O
to O
all O
the O
watch O
; O
nor O
was O
any O
mariner O
surprised O
when O
, O
after O
inspecting O
the O
compass O
, O
and O
then O
the O
dog-vane O
, O
and O
then O
ascertaining O
the O
precise O
bearing O
of O
the O
odor O
as O
nearly O
as O
possible O
, O
Ahab O
rapidly O
ordered O
the O
ship O
's O
course O
to O
be O
slightly O
altered O
, O
and O
the O
sail O
to O
be O
shortened O
. O
The O
acute O
policy O
dictating O
these O
movements O
was O
sufficiently O
vindicated O
at O
daybreak O
, O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
long O
sleek O
on O
the O
sea O
directly O
and O
lengthwise O
ahead O
, O
smooth O
as O
oil O
, O
and O
resembling O
in O
the O
pleated O
watery O
wrinkles O
bordering O
it O
, O
the O
polished O
metallic-like O
marks O
of O
some O
swift O
tide-rip O
, O
at O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
deep O
, O
rapid O
stream O
. O
" O
Man O
the O
mast-heads O
! O
Call O
all O
hands O
! O
" O
Thundering O
with O
the O
butts O
of O
three O
clubbed O
handspikes O
on O
the O
forecastle O
deck O
, O
Daggoo O
roused O
the O
sleepers O
with O
such O
judgment O
claps O
that O
they O
seemed O
to O
exhale O
from O
the O
scuttle O
, O
so O
instantaneously O
did O
they O
appear O
with O
their O
clothes O
in O
their O
hands O
. O
" O
What O
d O
'ye O
see O
? O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
flattening O
his O
face O
to O
the O
sky O
. O
" O
Nothing O
, O
nothing O
sir O
! O
" O
was O
the O
sound O
hailing O
down O
in O
reply O
. O
" O
T'gallant O
sails O
! O
—stunsails O
! O
alow O
and O
aloft O
, O
and O
on O
both O
sides O
! O
" O
All O
sail O
being O
set O
, O
he O
now O
cast O
loose O
the O
life-line O
, O
reserved O
for O
swaying O
him O
to O
the O
main O
royal-mast O
head O
; O
and O
in O
a O
few O
moments O
they O
were O
hoisting O
him O
thither O
, O
when O
, O
while O
but O
two O
thirds O
of O
the O
way O
aloft O
, O
and O
while O
peering O
ahead O
through O
the O
horizontal O
vacancy O
between O
the O
main-top-sail O
and O
top-gallant-sail O
, O
he O
raised O
a O
gull-like O
cry O
in O
the O
air O
. O
" O
There O
she O
blows O
! O
—there O
she O
blows O
! O
A O
hump O
like O
a O
snow-hill O
! O
It O
is O
Moby O
Dick O
! O
" O
Fired O
by O
the O
cry O
which O
seemed O
simultaneously O
taken O
up O
by O
the O
three O
look-outs O
, O
the O
men O
on O
deck O
rushed O
to O
the O
rigging O
to O
behold O
the O
famous O
whale O
they O
had O
so O
long O
been O
pursuing O
. O
Ahab O
had O
now O
gained O
his O
final O
perch O
, O
some O
feet O
above O
the O
other O
look-outs O
, O
Tashtego O
standing O
just O
beneath O
him O
on O
the O
cap O
of O
the O
top-gallant-mast O
, O
so O
that O
the O
Indian O
's O
head O
was O
almost O
on O
a O
level O
with O
Ahab O
's O
heel O
. O
From O
this O
height O
the O
whale O
was O
now O
seen O
some O
mile O
or O
so O
ahead O
, O
at O
every O
roll O
of O
the O
sea O
revealing O
his O
high O
sparkling O
hump O
, O
and O
regularly O
jetting O
his O
silent O
spout O
into O
the O
air O
. O
To O
the O
credulous O
mariners O
it O
seemed O
the O
same O
silent O
spout O
they O
had O
so O
long O
ago O
beheld O
in O
the O
moonlit O
Atlantic O
and O
Indian O
Oceans O
. O
" O
And O
did O
none O
of O
ye O
see O
it O
before O
? O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
hailing O
the O
perched O
men O
all O
around O
him O
. O
" O
I O
saw O
him O
almost O
that O
same O
instant O
, O
sir O
, O
that O
Captain O
Ahab O
did O
, O
and O
I O
cried O
out O
, O
" O
said O
Tashtego O
. O
" O
Not O
the O
same O
instant O
; O
not O
the O
same—no O
, O
the O
doubloon O
is O
mine O
, O
Fate O
reserved O
the O
doubloon O
for O
me O
. O
_I_ O
only O
; O
none O
of O
ye O
could O
have O
raised O
the O
White O
Whale O
first O

—there O
she O
blows O
! O
—there O
she O
blows O
! O
There O

! O

" O
he O
cried O
, O
in O
long-drawn O
, O
lingering O
, O
methodic O
tones O
, O
attuned O
to O
the O
gradual O
prolongings O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
visible O
jets O
. O
" O

" O
and O
he O
slid O
through O
the O
air O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
" O
He O
is O
heading O
straight O
to O
leeward O
, O

cried O
Stubb O
, O
" O

Boats O
, O

" O
Soon O
all O
the O
boats O
but O
Starbuck O
's O
were O
dropped O
; O
all O
the O
boat-sails O
set—all O
the O
paddles O
plying O
; O
with O
rippling O
swiftness O
, O
shooting O
to O
leeward O
; O
and O
Ahab O
heading O
the O
onset O
. O
A O
pale O
, O
death-glimmer O
lit O
up O
Fedallah O
's O
sunken O
eyes O
; O
a O
hideous O
motion O
gnawed O
his O
mouth O
. O
Like O
noiseless O
nautilus O
shells O
, O
their O
light O
prows O
sped O
through O
the O
sea O
; O
but O
only O
slowly O
they O
neared O
the O
foe O
. O
As O
they O
neared O
him O
, O
the O
ocean O
grew O
still O
more O
smooth O
; O
seemed O
drawing O
a O
carpet O
over O
its O
waves O
; O
seemed O
a O
noon-meadow O
, O
so O
serenely O
it O
spread O
. O
At O
length O
the O
breathless O
hunter O
came O
so O
nigh O
his O
seemingly O
unsuspecting O
prey O
, O
that O
his O
entire O
dazzling O
hump O
was O
distinctly O
visible O
, O
sliding O
along O
the O
sea O
as O
if O
an O
isolated O
thing O
, O
and O
continually O
set O
in O
a O
revolving O
ring O
of O
finest O
, O
fleecy O
, O
greenish O
foam O
. O
He O
saw O
the O
vast O
, O
involved O
wrinkles O
of O
the O
slightly O
projecting O
head O
beyond O
. O
Before O
it O
, O
far O
out O
on O
the O
soft O
Turkish-rugged O
waters O
, O
went O
the O
glistening O
white O
shadow O
from O
his O
broad O
, O
milky O
forehead O
, O
a O
musical O
rippling O
playfully O
accompanying O
the O
shade O
; O
and O
behind O
, O
the O
blue O
waters O
interchangeably O
flowed O
over O
into O
the O
moving O
valley O
of O
his O
steady O
wake O
; O
and O
on O
either O
hand O
bright O
bubbles O
arose O
and O
danced O
by O
his O
side O
. O
But O
these O
were O
broken O
again O
by O
the O
light O
toes O
of O
hundreds O
of O
gay O
fowl O
softly O
feathering O
the O
sea O
, O
alternate O
with O
their O
fitful O
flight O
; O
and O
like O
to O
some O
flag-staff O
rising O
from O
the O
painted O
hull O
of O
an O
argosy O
, O
the O
tall O
but O
shattered O
pole O
of O
a O
recent O
lance O
projected O
from O
the O
white O
whale O
's O
back O
; O
and O
at O
intervals O
one O
of O
the O
cloud O
of O
soft-toed O
fowls O
hovering O
, O
and O
to O
and O
fro O
skimming O
like O
a O
canopy O
over O
the O
fish O
, O
silently O
perched O
and O
rocked O
on O
this O
pole O
, O
the O
long O
tail O
feathers O
streaming O
like O
pennons O
. O
A O
gentle O
joyousness—a O
mighty O
mildness O
of O
repose O
in O
swiftness O
, O
invested O
the O
gliding O
whale O
. O
Not O
the O
white O
bull O
Jupiter O
swimming O
away O
with O
ravished O
Europa O
clinging O
to O
his O
graceful O
horns O
; O
his O
lovely O
, O
leering O
eyes O
sideways O
intent O
upon O
the O
maid O
; O
with O
smooth O
bewitching O
fleetness O
, O
rippling O
straight O
for O
the O
nuptial O
bower O
in O
Crete O
; O
not O
Jove O
, O
not O
that O
great O
majesty O
Supreme O
! O
did O
surpass O
the O
glorified O
White O
Whale O
as O
he O
so O
divinely O
swam O
. O
On O
each O
soft O
side—coincident O
with O
the O
parted O
swell O
, O
that O
but O
once O
leaving O
him O
, O
then O
flowed O
so O
wide O
away—on O
each O
bright O
side O
, O
the O
whale O
shed O
off O
enticings O
. O
No O
wonder O
there O
had O
been O
some O
among O
the O
hunters O
who O
namelessly O
transported O
and O
allured O
by O
all O
this O
serenity O
, O
had O
ventured O
to O
assail O
it O
; O
but O
had O
fatally O
found O
that O
quietude O
but O
the O
vesture O
of O
tornadoes O
. O
Yet O
calm O
, O
enticing O
calm O
, O
oh O
, O
whale O
! O
thou O
glidest O
on O
, O
to O
all O
who O
for O
the O
first O
time O
eye O
thee O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
many O
in O
that O
same O
way O
thou O
may'st O
have O
bejuggled O
and O
destroyed O
before O
. O
And O
thus O
, O
through O
the O
serene O
tranquillities O
of O
the O
tropical O
sea O
, O
among O
waves O
whose O
hand-clappings O
were O
suspended O
by O
exceeding O
rapture O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
moved O
on O
, O
still O
withholding O
from O
sight O
the O
full O
terrors O
of O
his O
submerged O
trunk O
, O
entirely O
hiding O
the O
wrenched O
hideousness O
of O
his O
jaw O
. O
But O
soon O
the O
fore O
part O
of O
him O
slowly O
rose O
from O
the O
water O
; O
for O
an O
instant O
his O
whole O
marbleized O
body O
formed O
a O
high O
arch O
, O
like O
Virginia O
's O
Natural O
Bridge O
, O
and O
warningly O
waving O
his O
bannered O
flukes O
in O
the O
air O
, O
the O
grand O
god O
revealed O
himself O
, O
sounded O
, O
and O
went O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
Hoveringly O
halting O
, O
and O
dipping O
on O
the O
wing O
, O
the O
white O
sea-fowls O
longingly O
lingered O
over O
the O
agitated O
pool O
that O
he O
left O
. O
With O
oars O
apeak O
, O
and O
paddles O
down O
, O
the O
sheets O
of O
their O
sails O
adrift O
, O
the O
three O
boats O
now O
stilly O
floated O
, O
awaiting O
Moby O
Dick O
's O
reappearance O
. O
" O
An O
hour O
, O
" O
said O
Ahab O
, O
standing O
rooted O
in O
his O
boat O
's O
stern O
; O
and O
he O
gazed O
beyond O
the O
whale O
's O
place O
, O
towards O
the O
dim O
blue O
spaces O
and O
wide O
wooing O
vacancies O
to O
leeward O
. O
It O
was O
only O
an O
instant O
; O
for O
again O
his O
eyes O
seemed O
whirling O
round O
in O
his O
head O
as O
he O
swept O
the O
watery O
circle O
. O
The O
breeze O
now O
freshened O
; O
the O
sea O
began O
to O
swell O
. O
" O
The O
birds O
! O
—the O
birds O
! O
" O
cried O
Tashtego O
. O
In O
long O
Indian O
file O
, O
as O
when O
herons O
take O
wing O
, O
the O
white O
birds O
were O
now O
all O
flying O
towards O
Ahab O
's O
boat O
; O
and O
when O
within O
a O
few O
yards O
began O
fluttering O
over O
the O
water O
there O
, O
wheeling O
round O
and O
round O
, O
with O
joyous O
, O
expectant O
cries O
. O
Their O
vision O
was O
keener O
than O
man O
's O
; O
Ahab O
could O
discover O
no O
sign O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
But O
suddenly O
as O
he O
peered O
down O
and O
down O
into O
its O
depths O
, O
he O
profoundly O
saw O
a O
white O
living O
spot O
no O
bigger O
than O
a O
white O
weasel O
, O
with O
wonderful O
celerity O
uprising O
, O
and O
magnifying O
as O
it O
rose O
, O
till O
it O
turned O
, O
and O
then O
there O
were O
plainly O
revealed O
two O
long O
crooked O
rows O
of O
white O
, O
glistening O
teeth O
, O
floating O
up O
from O
the O
undiscoverable O
bottom O
. O
It O
was O
Moby O
Dick O
's O
open O
mouth O
and O
scrolled O
jaw O
; O
his O
vast O
, O
shadowed O
bulk O
still O
half O
blending O
with O
the O
blue O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
The O
glittering O
mouth O
yawned O
beneath O
the O
boat O
like O
an O
open-doored O
marble O
tomb O
; O
and O
giving O
one O
sidelong O
sweep O
with O
his O
steering O
oar O
, O
Ahab O
whirled O
the O
craft O
aside O
from O
this O
tremendous O
apparition O
. O
Then O
, O
calling O
upon O
Fedallah O
to O
change O
places O
with O
him O
, O
went O
forward O
to O
the O
bows O
, O
and O
seizing O
Perth O
's O
harpoon O
, O
commanded O
his O
crew O
to O
grasp O
their O
oars O
and O
stand O
by O
to O
stern O
. O
Now O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
this O
timely O
spinning O
round O
the O
boat O
upon O
its O
axis O
, O
its O
bow O
, O
by O
anticipation O
, O
was O
made O
to O
face O
the O
whale O
's O
head O
while O
yet O
under O
water O
. O
But O
as O
if O
perceiving O
this O
stratagem O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
, O
with O
that O
malicious O
intelligence O
ascribed O
to O
him O
, O
sidelingly O
transplanted O
himself O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
in O
an O
instant O
, O
shooting O
his O
pleated O
head O
lengthwise O
beneath O
the O
boat O
. O
Through O
and O
through O
; O
through O
every O
plank O
and O
each O
rib O
, O
it O
thrilled O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
the O
whale O
obliquely O
lying O
on O
his O
back O
, O
in O
the O
manner O
of O
a O
biting O
shark O
, O
slowly O
and O
feelingly O
taking O
its O
bows O
full O
within O
his O
mouth O
, O
so O
that O
the O
long O
, O
narrow O
, O
scrolled O
lower O
jaw O
curled O
high O
up O
into O
the O
open O
air O
, O
and O
one O
of O
the O
teeth O
caught O
in O
a O
row-lock O
. O
The O
bluish O
pearl-white O
of O
the O
inside O
of O
the O
jaw O
was O
within O
six O
inches O
of O
Ahab O
's O
head O
, O
and O
reached O
higher O
than O
that O
. O
In O
this O
attitude O
the O
White O
Whale O
now O
shook O
the O
slight O
cedar O
as O
a O
mildly O
cruel O
cat O
her O
mouse O
. O
With O
unastonished O
eyes O
Fedallah O
gazed O
, O
and O
crossed O
his O
arms O
; O
but O
the O
tiger-yellow O
crew O
were O
tumbling O
over O
each O
other O
's O
heads O
to O
gain O
the O
uttermost O
stern O
. O
And O
now O
, O
while O
both O
elastic O
gunwales O
were O
springing O
in O
and O
out O
, O
as O
the O
whale O
dallied O
with O
the O
doomed O
craft O
in O
this O
devilish O
way O
; O
and O
from O
his O
body O
being O
submerged O
beneath O
the O
boat O
, O
he O
could O
not O
be O
darted O
at O
from O
the O
bows O
, O
for O
the O
bows O
were O
almost O
inside O
of O
him O
, O
as O
it O
were O
; O
and O
while O
the O
other O
boats O
involuntarily O
paused O
, O
as O
before O
a O
quick O
crisis O
impossible O
to O
withstand O
, O
then O
it O
was O
that O
monomaniac O
Ahab O
, O
furious O
with O
this O
tantalizing O
vicinity O
of O
his O
foe O
, O
which O
placed O
him O
all O
alive O
and O
helpless O
in O
the O
very O
jaws O
he O
hated O
; O
frenzied O
with O
all O
this O
, O
he O
seized O
the O
long O
bone O
with O
his O
naked O
hands O
, O
and O
wildly O
strove O
to O
wrench O
it O
from O
its O
gripe O
. O
As O
now O
he O
thus O
vainly O
strove O
, O
the O
jaw O
slipped O
from O
him O
; O
the O
frail O
gunwales O
bent O
in O
, O
collapsed O
, O
and O
snapped O
, O
as O
both O
jaws O
, O
like O
an O
enormous O
shears O
, O
sliding O
further O
aft O
, O
bit O
the O
craft O
completely O
in O
twain O
, O
and O
locked O
themselves O
fast O
again O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
midway O
between O
the O
two O
floating O
wrecks O
. O
These O
floated O
aside O
, O
the O
broken O
ends O
drooping O
, O
the O
crew O
at O
the O
stern-wreck O
clinging O
to O
the O
gunwales O
, O
and O
striving O
to O
hold O
fast O
to O
the O
oars O
to O
lash O
them O
across O
. O
At O
that O
preluding O
moment O
, O
ere O
the O
boat O
was O
yet O
snapped O
, O
Ahab O
, O
the O
first O
to O
perceive O
the O
whale O
's O
intent O
, O
by O
the O
crafty O
upraising O
of O
his O
head O
, O
a O
movement O
that O
loosed O
his O
hold O
for O
the O
time O
; O
at O
that O
moment O
his O
hand O
had O
made O
one O
final O
effort O
to O
push O
the O
boat O
out O
of O
the O
bite O
. O
But O
only O
slipping O
further O
into O
the O
whale O
's O
mouth O
, O
and O
tilting O
over O
sideways O
as O
it O
slipped O
, O
the O
boat O
had O
shaken O
off O
his O
hold O
on O
the O
jaw O
; O
spilled O
him O
out O
of O
it O
, O
as O
he O
leaned O
to O
the O
push O
; O
and O
so O
he O
fell O
flat-faced O
upon O
the O
sea O
. O
Ripplingly O
withdrawing O
from O
his O
prey O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
now O
lay O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
, O
vertically O
thrusting O
his O
oblong O
white O
head O
up O
and O
down O
in O
the O
billows O
; O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
slowly O
revolving O
his O
whole O
spindled O
body O
; O
so O
that O
when O
his O
vast O
wrinkled O
forehead O
rose—some O
twenty O
or O
more O
feet O
out O
of O
the O
water—the O
now O
rising O
swells O
, O
with O
all O
their O
confluent O
waves O
, O
dazzlingly O
broke O
against O
it O
; O
vindictively O
tossing O
their O
shivered O
spray O
still O
higher O
into O
the O
air O
. O
* O
So O
, O
in O
a O
gale O
, O
the O
but O
half O
baffled O
Channel O
billows O
only O
recoil O
from O
the O
base O
of O
the O
Eddystone O
, O
triumphantly O
to O
overleap O
its O
summit O
with O
their O
scud O
. O
* O
This O
motion O
is O
peculiar O
to O
the O
sperm O
whale O
. O
It O
receives O
its O
designation O
( O
pitchpoling O
) O
from O
its O
being O
likened O
to O
that O
preliminary O
up-and-down O
poise O
of O
the O
whale-lance O
, O
in O
the O
exercise O
called O
pitchpoling O
, O
previously O
described O
. O
By O
this O
motion O
the O
whale O
must O
best O
and O
most O
comprehensively O
view O
whatever O
objects O
may O
be O
encircling O
him O
. O
But O
soon O
resuming O
his O
horizontal O
attitude O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
swam O
swiftly O
round O
and O
round O
the O
wrecked O
crew O
; O
sideways O
churning O
the O
water O
in O
his O
vengeful O
wake O
, O
as O
if O
lashing O
himself O
up O
to O
still O
another O
and O
more O
deadly O
assault O
. O
The O
sight O
of O
the O
splintered O
boat O
seemed O
to O
madden O
him O
, O
as O
the O
blood O
of O
grapes O
and O
mulberries O
cast O
before O
Antiochus O
's O
elephants O
in O
the O
book O
of O
Maccabees O
. O
Meanwhile O
Ahab O
half O
smothered O
in O
the O
foam O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
insolent O
tail O
, O
and O
too O
much O
of O
a O
cripple O
to O
swim O
, O
—though O
he O
could O
still O
keep O
afloat O
, O
even O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
such O
a O
whirlpool O
as O
that O
; O
helpless O
Ahab O
's O
head O
was O
seen O
, O
like O
a O
tossed O
bubble O
which O
the O
least O
chance O
shock O
might O
burst O
. O
From O
the O
boat O
's O
fragmentary O
stern O
, O
Fedallah O
incuriously O
and O
mildly O
eyed O
him O
; O
the O
clinging O
crew O
, O
at O
the O
other O
drifting O
end O
, O
could O
not O
succor O
him O
; O
more O
than O
enough O
was O
it O
for O
them O
to O
look O
to O
themselves O
. O
For O
so O
revolvingly O
appalling O
was O
the O
White O
Whale O
's O
aspect O
, O
and O
so O
planetarily O
swift O
the O
ever-contracting O
circles O
he O
made O
, O
that O
he O
seemed O
horizontally O
swooping O
upon O
them O
. O
And O
though O
the O
other O
boats O
, O
unharmed O
, O
still O
hovered O
hard O
by O
; O
still O
they O
dared O
not O
pull O
into O
the O
eddy O
to O
strike O
, O
lest O
that O
should O
be O
the O
signal O
for O
the O
instant O
destruction O
of O
the O
jeopardized O
castaways O
, O
Ahab O
and O
all O
; O
nor O
in O
that O
case O
could O
they O
themselves O
hope O
to O
escape O
. O
With O
straining O
eyes O
, O
then O
, O
they O
remained O
on O
the O
outer O
edge O
of O
the O
direful O
zone O
, O
whose O
centre O
had O
now O
become O
the O
old O
man O
's O
head O
. O
Meantime O
, O
from O
the O
beginning O
all O
this O
had O
been O
descried O
from O
the O
ship O
's O
mast O
heads O
; O
and O
squaring O
her O
yards O
, O
she O
had O
borne O
down O
upon O
the O
scene O
; O
and O
was O
now O
so O
nigh O
, O
that O
Ahab O
in O
the O
water O
hailed O
her O
! O
— O
" O
Sail O
on O
the O
" O
—but O
that O
moment O
a O
breaking O
sea O
dashed O
on O
him O
from O
Moby O
Dick O
, O
and O
whelmed O
him O
for O
the O
time O
. O
But O
struggling O
out O
of O
it O
again O
, O
and O
chancing O
to O
rise O
on O
a O
towering O
crest O
, O
he O
shouted O
, O
— O
" O
Sail O
on O
the O
whale O
! O
—Drive O
him O
off O
! O
" O
The O
Pequod O
's O
prows O
were O
pointed O
; O
and O
breaking O
up O
the O
charmed O
circle O
, O
she O
effectually O
parted O
the O
white O
whale O
from O
his O
victim O
. O
As O
he O
sullenly O
swam O
off O
, O
the O
boats O
flew O
to O
the O
rescue O
. O
Dragged O
into O
Stubb O
's O
boat O
with O
blood-shot O
, O
blinded O
eyes O
, O
the O
white O
brine O
caking O
in O
his O
wrinkles O
; O
the O
long O
tension O
of O
Ahab O
's O
bodily O
strength O
did O
crack O
, O
and O
helplessly O
he O
yielded O
to O
his O
body O
's O
doom O
: O
for O
a O
time O
, O
lying O
all O
crushed O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
Stubb O
's O
boat O
, O
like O
one O
trodden O
under O
foot O
of O
herds O
of O
elephants O
. O
Far O
inland O
, O
nameless O
wails O
came O
from O
him O
, O
as O
desolate O
sounds O
from O
out O
ravines O
. O
But O
this O
intensity O
of O
his O
physical O
prostration O
did O
but O
so O
much O
the O
more O
abbreviate O
it O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
's O
compass O
, O
great O
hearts O
sometimes O
condense O
to O
one O
deep O
pang O
, O
the O
sum O
total O
of O
those O
shallow O
pains O
kindly O
diffused O
through O
feebler O
men O
's O
whole O
lives O
. O
And O
so O
, O
such O
hearts O
, O
though O
summary O
in O
each O
one O
suffering O
; O
still O
, O
if O
the O
gods O
decree O
it O
, O
in O
their O
life-time O
aggregate O
a O
whole O
age O
of O
woe O
, O
wholly O
made O
up O
of O
instantaneous O
intensities O
; O
for O
even O
in O
their O
pointless O
centres O
, O
those O
noble O
natures O
contain O
the O
entire O
circumferences O
of O
inferior O
souls O
. O
" O
The O
harpoon O
, O
" O
said O
Ahab O
, O
half O
way O
rising O
, O
and O
draggingly O
leaning O
on O
one O
bended O
arm— O
" O
is O
it O
safe O
? O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
sir O
, O
for O
it O

; O

said O
Stubb O
, O
showing O
it O
. O
" O

; O
—any O

That O

good.—Help O
me O
, O

wish O
to O

So O
, O
so O
, O
I O
see O
him O
! O
there O
! O
there O
! O
going O
to O
leeward O
still O
; O
what O
a O
leaping O
spout O
! O
—Hands O
off O
from O
me O
! O
The O
eternal O
sap O
runs O
up O
in O
Ahab O
's O
bones O
again O
! O
Set O
the O
sail O
; O
out O
oars O
; O
the O
helm O
! O
" O
It O
is O
often O
the O
case O
that O
when O
a O
boat O
is O
stove O
, O
its O
crew O
, O
being O
picked O
up O
by O
another O
boat O
, O
help O
to O
work O
that O
second O
boat O
; O
and O
the O
chase O
is O
thus O
continued O
with O
what O
is O
called O
double-banked O
oars O
. O
It O
was O
thus O
now O
. O
But O
the O
added O
power O
of O
the O
boat O
did O
not O
equal O
the O
added O
power O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
for O
he O
seemed O
to O
have O
treble-banked O
his O
every O
fin O
; O
swimming O
with O
a O
velocity O
which O
plainly O
showed O
, O
that O
if O
now O
, O
under O
these O
circumstances O
, O
pushed O
on O
, O
the O
chase O
would O
prove O
an O
indefinitely O
prolonged O
, O
if O
not O
a O
hopeless O
one O
; O
nor O
could O
any O
crew O
endure O
for O
so O
long O
a O
period O
, O
such O
an O
unintermitted O
, O
intense O
straining O
at O
the O
oar O
; O
a O
thing O
barely O
tolerable O
only O
in O
some O
one O
brief O
vicissitude O
. O
The O
ship O
itself O
, O
then O
, O
as O
it O
sometimes O
happens O
, O
offered O
the O
most O
promising O
intermediate O
means O
of O
overtaking O
the O
chase O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
the O
boats O
now O
made O
for O
her O
, O
and O
were O
soon O
swayed O
up O
to O
their O
cranes—the O
two O
parts O
of O
the O
wrecked O
boat O
having O
been O
previously O
secured O
by O
her—and O
then O
hoisting O
everything O
to O
her O
side O
, O
and O
stacking O
her O
canvas O
high O
up O
, O
and O
sideways O
outstretching O
it O
with O
stun-sails O
, O
like O
the O
double-jointed O
wings O
of O
an O
albatross O
; O
the O
Pequod O
bore O
down O
in O
the O
leeward O
wake O
of O
Moby-Dick O
. O
At O
the O
well O
known O
, O
methodic O
intervals O
, O
the O
whale O
's O
glittering O
spout O
was O
regularly O
announced O
from O
the O
manned O
mast-heads O
; O
and O
when O
he O
would O
be O
reported O
as O
just O
gone O
down O
, O
Ahab O
would O
take O
the O
time O
, O
and O
then O
pacing O
the O
deck O
, O
binnacle-watch O
in O
hand O
, O
so O
soon O
as O
the O
last O
second O
of O
the O
allotted O
hour O
expired O
, O
his O
voice O
was O
heard.— O
" O
Whose O
is O
the O
doubloon O
now O
? O
D O
'ye O
see O
him O
? O
" O
and O
if O
the O
reply O
was O
, O
No O
, O
sir O
! O
straightway O
he O
commanded O
them O
to O
lift O
him O
to O
his O
perch O
. O
In O
this O
way O
the O
day O
wore O
on O
; O
Ahab O
, O
now O
aloft O
and O
motionless O
; O
anon O
, O
unrestingly O
pacing O
the O
planks O
. O
As O
he O
was O
thus O
walking O
, O
uttering O
no O
sound O
, O
except O
to O
hail O
the O
men O
aloft O
, O
or O
to O
bid O
them O
hoist O
a O
sail O
still O
higher O
, O
or O
to O
spread O
one O
to O
a O
still O
greater O
breadth—thus O
to O
and O
fro O
pacing O
, O
beneath O
his O
slouched O
hat O
, O
at O
every O
turn O
he O
passed O
his O
own O
wrecked O
boat O
, O
which O
had O
been O
dropped O
upon O
the O
quarter-deck O
, O
and O
lay O
there O
reversed O
; O
broken O
bow O
to O
shattered O
stern O
. O
At O
last O
he O
paused O
before O
it O
; O
and O
as O
in O
an O
already O
over-clouded O
sky O
fresh O
troops O
of O
clouds O
will O
sometimes O
sail O
across O
, O
so O
over O
the O
old O
man O
's O
face O
there O
now O
stole O
some O
such O
added O
gloom O
as O
this O
. O
Stubb O
saw O
him O
pause O
; O
and O
perhaps O
intending O
, O
not O
vainly O
, O
though O
, O
to O
evince O
his O
own O
unabated O
fortitude O
, O
and O
thus O
keep O
up O
a O
valiant O
place O
in O
his O
Captain O
's O
mind O
, O
he O
advanced O
, O
and O
eyeing O
the O
wreck O
exclaimed— O
" O
The O
thistle O

ass O

; O
it O
pricked O
his O
mouth O
too O
keenly O
, O
sir O
; O

" O
" O
What O
soulless O

is O
this O
that O
laughs O
before O
a O

did O
I O
not O

thee O

as O

could O
swear O
thou O
wert O

be O
