Some O
days O
elapsed O
, O
and O
ice O
and O
icebergs O
all O
astern O
, O
the O
Pequod O
now O
went O
rolling O
through O
the O
bright O
Quito O
spring O
, O
which O
, O
at O
sea O
, O
almost O
perpetually O
reigns O
on O
the O
threshold O
of O
the O
eternal O
August O
of O
the O
Tropic O
. O
The O
warmly O
cool O
, O
clear O
, O
ringing O
, O
perfumed O
, O
overflowing O
, O
redundant O
days O
, O
were O
as O
crystal O
goblets O
of O
Persian O
sherbet O
, O
heaped O
up—flaked O
up O
, O
with O
rose-water O
snow O
. O
The O
starred O
and O
stately O
nights O
seemed O
haughty O
dames O
in O
jewelled O
velvets O
, O
nursing O
at O
home O
in O
lonely O
pride O
, O
the O
memory O
of O
their O
absent O
conquering O
Earls O
, O
the O
golden O
helmeted O
suns O
! O
For O
sleeping O
man O
, O
't O
was O
hard O
to O
choose O
between O
such O
winsome O
days O
and O
such O
seducing O
nights O
. O
But O
all O
the O
witcheries O
of O
that O
unwaning O
weather O
did O
not O
merely O
lend O
new O
spells O
and O
potencies O
to O
the O
outward O
world O
. O
Inward O
they O
turned O
upon O
the O
soul O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
still O
mild O
hours O
of O
eve O
came O
on O
; O
then O
, O
memory O
shot O
her O
crystals O
as O
the O
clear O
ice O
most O
forms O
of O
noiseless O
twilights O
. O
And O
all O
these O
subtle O
agencies O
, O
more O
and O
more O
they O
wrought O
on O
Ahab O
's O
texture O
. O
Old O
age O
is O
always O
wakeful O
; O
as O
if O
, O
the O
longer O
linked O
with O
life O
, O
the O
less O
man O
has O
to O
do O
with O
aught O
that O
looks O
like O
death O
. O
Among O
sea-commanders O
, O
the O
old O
greybeards O
will O
oftenest O
leave O
their O
berths O
to O
visit O
the O
night-cloaked O
deck O
. O
It O
was O
so O
with O
Ahab O
; O
only O
that O
now O
, O
of O
late O
, O
he O
seemed O
so O
much O
to O
live O
in O
the O
open O
air O
, O
that O
truly O
speaking O
, O
his O
visits O
were O
more O
to O
the O
cabin O
, O
than O
from O
the O
cabin O
to O
the O
planks O
. O
" O
It O
feels O
like O
going O
down O
into O
one O
's O
tomb O
, O
" O
—he O
would O
mutter O
to O
himself— O
" O
for O
an O
old O
captain O
like O
me O
to O
be O
descending O
this O
narrow O
scuttle O
, O
to O
go O
to O
my O
grave-dug O
berth O
. O
" O
So O
, O
almost O
every O
twenty-four O
hours O
, O
when O
the O
watches O
of O
the O
night O
were O
set O
, O
and O
the O
band O
on O
deck O
sentinelled O
the O
slumbers O
of O
the O
band O
below O
; O
and O
when O
if O
a O
rope O
was O
to O
be O
hauled O
upon O
the O
forecastle O
, O
the O
sailors O
flung O
it O
not O
rudely O
down O
, O
as O
by O
day O
, O
but O
with O
some O
cautiousness O
dropt O
it O
to O
its O
place O
for O
fear O
of O
disturbing O
their O
slumbering O
shipmates O
; O
when O
this O
sort O
of O
steady O
quietude O
would O
begin O
to O
prevail O
, O
habitually O
, O
the O
silent O
steersman O
would O
watch O
the O
cabin-scuttle O
; O
and O
ere O
long O
the O
old O
man O
would O
emerge O
, O
gripping O
at O
the O
iron O
banister O
, O
to O
help O
his O
crippled O
way O
. O
Some O
considering O
touch O
of O
humanity O
was O
in O
him O
; O
for O
at O
times O
like O
these O
, O
he O
usually O
abstained O
from O
patrolling O
the O
quarter-deck O
; O
because O
to O
his O
wearied O
mates O
, O
seeking O
repose O
within O
six O
inches O
of O
his O
ivory O
heel O
, O
such O
would O
have O
been O
the O
reverberating O
crack O
and O
din O
of O
that O
bony O
step O
, O
that O
their O
dreams O
would O
have O
been O
on O
the O
crunching O
teeth O
of O
sharks O
. O
But O
once O
, O
the O
mood O
was O
on O
him O
too O
deep O
for O
common O
regardings O
; O
and O
as O
with O
heavy O
, O
lumber-like O
pace O
he O
was O
measuring O
the O
ship O
from O
taffrail O
to O
mainmast O
, O
Stubb O
, O
the O
old O
second O
mate O
, O
came O
up O
from O
below O
, O
with O
a O
certain O
unassured O
, O
deprecating O
humorousness O
, O
hinted O
that O
if O
Captain O
Ahab O
was O
pleased O
to O
walk O
the O
planks O
, O
then O
, O
no O
one O
could O
say O
nay O
; O
but O
there O
might O
be O
some O
way O
of O
muffling O
the O
noise O
; O
hinting O
something O
indistinctly O
and O
hesitatingly O
about O
a O
globe O
of O
tow O
, O
and O
the O
insertion O
into O
it O
, O
of O
the O
ivory O
heel O
. O
Ah O
! O
Stubb O
, O
thou O
didst O
not O
know O
Ahab O
then O
. O
" O
Am O
I O
a O
cannon-ball O
, O
Stubb O
, O
" O
said O
Ahab O
, O
" O
that O
thou O
wouldst O
wad O
me O
that O
fashion O
? O
But O
go O
thy O
ways O
; O
I O
had O
forgot O
. O
Below O
to O
thy O
nightly O
grave O
; O
where O
such O
as O
ye O
sleep O
between O
shrouds O
, O
to O
use O
ye O
to O
the O
filling O
one O
at O
last.—Down O
, O
dog O
, O
and O
kennel O
! O
" O
Starting O
at O
the O
unforseen O
concluding O
exclamation O
of O
the O
so O
suddenly O
scornful O
old O
man O
, O
Stubb O
was O
speechless O
a O
moment O
; O
then O
said O
excitedly O
, O
" O
I O
am O
not O
used O
to O
be O
spoken O
to O
that O
way O
, O
sir O
; O
I O
do O
but O
less O
than O
half O
like O
it O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Avast O
! O
gritted O
Ahab O
between O
his O
set O
teeth O
, O
and O
violently O
moving O
away O
, O
as O
if O
to O
avoid O
some O
passionate O
temptation O
. O
" O
No O
, O
sir O
; O
not O
yet O
, O
" O
said O
Stubb O
, O
emboldened O
, O
" O
I O
will O
not O
tamely O
be O
called O
a O
dog O
, O
sir O
. O
" O
" O
Then O
be O
called O
ten O
times O
a O
donkey O
, O
and O
a O
mule O
, O
and O
an O
ass O
, O
and O
begone O
, O
or O
I O
'll O
clear O
the O
world O
of O
thee O
! O
" O
As O
he O
said O
this O
, O
Ahab O
advanced O
upon O
him O
with O
such O
overbearing O
terrors O
in O
his O
aspect O
, O
that O
Stubb O
involuntarily O
retreated O
. O
" O
I O
was O
never O
served O
so O
before O
without O
giving O
a O
hard O
blow O
for O
it O
, O
" O
muttered O
Stubb O
, O
as O
he O
found O
himself O
descending O
the O
cabin-scuttle O
. O
" O
It O
's O
very O
queer O
. O
Stop O
, O
Stubb O
; O
somehow O
, O
now O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
well O
know O
whether O
to O
go O
back O
and O
strike O
him O
, O
or—what O
's O
that O
? O
—down O
here O
on O
my O
knees O
and O
pray O
for O
him O
? O
Yes O
, O
that O
was O
the O
thought O
coming O
up O
in O
me O
; O
but O
it O
would O
be O
the O
first O
time O
I O
ever O
_did_ O
pray O
. O
It O
's O
queer O
; O
very O
queer O
; O
and O
he O
's O
queer O
too O
; O
aye O
, O
take O
him O
fore O
and O
aft O
, O
he O
's O
about O
the O
queerest O
old O
man O
Stubb O
ever O
sailed O
with O
. O
How O
he O
flashed O
at O
me O
! O
—his O
eyes O
like O
powder-pans O
! O
is O
he O
mad O
? O
Anyway O
there O
's O
something O
on O
his O
mind O
, O
as O
sure O
as O
there O
must O
be O
something O
on O
a O
deck O
when O
it O
cracks O
. O
He O
aint O
in O
his O
bed O
now O
, O
either O
, O
more O
than O
three O
hours O
out O
of O
the O
twenty-four O
; O
and O
he O
do O
n't O
sleep O
then O
. O
Did O
n't O
that O
Dough-Boy O
, O
the O
steward O
, O
tell O
me O
that O
of O
a O
morning O
he O
always O
finds O
the O
old O
man O
's O
hammock O
clothes O
all O
rumpled O
and O
tumbled O
, O
and O
the O
sheets O
down O
at O
the O
foot O
, O
and O
the O
coverlid O
almost O
tied O
into O
knots O
, O
and O
the O
pillow O
a O
sort O
of O
frightful O
hot O
, O
as O
though O
a O
baked O
brick O
had O
been O
on O
it O
? O
A O
hot O
old O
man O
! O
I O
guess O
he O
's O
got O
what O
some O
folks O
ashore O
call O
a O
conscience O
; O
it O
's O
a O
kind O
of O
Tic-Dolly-row O
they O
say—worse O
nor O
a O
toothache O
. O
Well O
, O
well O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
it O
is O
, O
but O
the O
Lord O
keep O
me O
from O
catching O
it O
. O
He O
's O
full O
of O
riddles O
; O
I O
wonder O
what O
he O
goes O
into O
the O
after O
hold O
for O
, O
every O
night O
, O
as O
Dough-Boy O
tells O
me O
he O
suspects O
; O
what O
's O
that O
for O
, O
I O
should O
like O
to O
know O
? O
Who O
's O
made O
appointments O
with O
him O
in O
the O
hold O
? O
Ai O
n't O
that O
queer O
, O
now O
? O
But O
there O
's O
no O
telling O
, O
it O
's O
the O
old O
game—Here O
goes O
for O
a O
snooze O
. O
Damn O
me O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
a O
fellow O
's O
while O
to O
be O
born O
into O
the O
world O
, O
if O
only O
to O
fall O
right O
asleep O
. O
And O
now O
that O
I O
think O
of O
it O
, O
that O
's O
about O
the O
first O
thing O
babies O
do O
, O
and O
that O
's O
a O
sort O
of O
queer O
, O
too O
. O
Damn O
me O
, O
but O
all O
things O
are O
queer O
, O
come O
to O
think O
of O
'em O
. O
But O
that O
's O
against O
my O
principles O
. O
Think O
not O
, O
is O
my O
eleventh O
commandment O
; O
and O
sleep O
when O
you O
can O
, O
is O
my O
twelfth—So O
here O
goes O
again O
. O
But O
how O
's O
that O
? O
did O
n't O
he O
call O
me O
a O
dog O
? O
blazes O
! O
he O
called O
me O
ten O
times O
a O
donkey O
, O
and O
piled O
a O
lot O
of O
jackasses O
on O
top O
of O
_that O
! O
_ O
He O
might O
as O
well O
have O
kicked O
me O
, O
and O
done O
with O
it O
. O
Maybe O
he O
_did_ O
kick O
me O
, O
and O
I O
did O
n't O
observe O
it O
, O
I O
was O
so O
taken O
all O
aback O
with O
his O
brow O
, O
somehow O
. O
It O
flashed O
like O
a O
bleached O
bone O
. O
What O
the O
devil O
's O
the O
matter O
with O
me O
? O
I O
do O
n't O
stand O
right O
on O
my O
legs O
. O
Coming O
afoul O
of O
that O
old O
man O
has O
a O
sort O
of O
turned O
me O
wrong O
side O
out O
. O
By O
the O
Lord O
, O
I O
must O
have O
been O
dreaming O
, O
though—How O
? O
how O
? O
how O
? O
—but O
the O
only O
way O
's O
to O
stash O
it O
; O
so O
here O
goes O
to O
hammock O
again O
; O
and O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
I O
'll O
see O
how O
this O
plaguey O
juggling O
thinks O
over O
by O
daylight O
. O
