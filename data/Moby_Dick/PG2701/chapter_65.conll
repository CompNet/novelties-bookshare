That O
mortal O
man O
should O
feed O
upon O
the O
creature O
that O
feeds O
his O
lamp O
, O
and O
, O
like O
Stubb O
, O
eat O
him O
by O
his O
own O
light O
, O
as O
you O
may O
say O
; O
this O
seems O
so O
outlandish O
a O
thing O
that O
one O
must O
needs O
go O
a O
little O
into O
the O
history O
and O
philosophy O
of O
it O
. O
It O
is O
upon O
record O
, O
that O
three O
centuries O
ago O
the O
tongue O
of O
the O
Right O
Whale O
was O
esteemed O
a O
great O
delicacy O
in O
France O
, O
and O
commanded O
large O
prices O
there O
. O
Also O
, O
that O
in O
Henry O
VIIIth O
's O
time O
, O
a O
certain O
cook O
of O
the O
court O
obtained O
a O
handsome O
reward O
for O
inventing O
an O
admirable O
sauce O
to O
be O
eaten O
with O
barbacued O
porpoises O
, O
which O
, O
you O
remember O
, O
are O
a O
species O
of O
whale O
. O
Porpoises O
, O
indeed O
, O
are O
to O
this O
day O
considered O
fine O
eating O
. O
The O
meat O
is O
made O
into O
balls O
about O
the O
size O
of O
billiard O
balls O
, O
and O
being O
well O
seasoned O
and O
spiced O
might O
be O
taken O
for O
turtle-balls O
or O
veal O
balls O
. O
The O
old O
monks O
of O
Dunfermline O
were O
very O
fond O
of O
them O
. O
They O
had O
a O
great O
porpoise O
grant O
from O
the O
crown O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
that O
among O
his O
hunters O
at O
least O
, O
the O
whale O
would O
by O
all O
hands O
be O
considered O
a O
noble O
dish O
, O
were O
there O
not O
so O
much O
of O
him O
; O
but O
when O
you O
come O
to O
sit O
down O
before O
a O
meat-pie O
nearly O
one O
hundred O
feet O
long O
, O
it O
takes O
away O
your O
appetite O
. O
Only O
the O
most O
unprejudiced O
of O
men O
like O
Stubb O
, O
nowadays O
partake O
of O
cooked O
whales O
; O
but O
the O
Esquimaux O
are O
not O
so O
fastidious O
. O
We O
all O
know O
how O
they O
live O
upon O
whales O
, O
and O
have O
rare O
old O
vintages O
of O
prime O
old O
train O
oil O
. O
Zogranda O
, O
one O
of O
their O
most O
famous O
doctors O
, O
recommends O
strips O
of O
blubber O
for O
infants O
, O
as O
being O
exceedingly O
juicy O
and O
nourishing O
. O
And O
this O
reminds O
me O
that O
certain O
Englishmen O
, O
who O
long O
ago O
were O
accidentally O
left O
in O
Greenland O
by O
a O
whaling O
vessel—that O
these O
men O
actually O
lived O
for O
several O
months O
on O
the O
mouldy O
scraps O
of O
whales O
which O
had O
been O
left O
ashore O
after O
trying O
out O
the O
blubber O
. O
Among O
the O
Dutch O
whalemen O
these O
scraps O
are O
called O
" O
fritters O
" O
; O
which O
, O
indeed O
, O
they O
greatly O
resemble O
, O
being O
brown O
and O
crisp O
, O
and O
smelling O
something O
like O
old O
Amsterdam O
housewives O
' O
dough-nuts O
or O
oly-cooks O
, O
when O
fresh O
. O
They O
have O
such O
an O
eatable O
look O
that O
the O
most O
self-denying O
stranger O
can O
hardly O
keep O
his O
hands O
off O
. O
But O
what O
further O
depreciates O
the O
whale O
as O
a O
civilized O
dish O
, O
is O
his O
exceeding O
richness O
. O
He O
is O
the O
great O
prize O
ox O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
too O
fat O
to O
be O
delicately O
good O
. O
Look O
at O
his O
hump O
, O
which O
would O
be O
as O
fine O
eating O
as O
the O
buffalo O
's O
( O
which O
is O
esteemed O
a O
rare O
dish O
) O
, O
were O
it O
not O
such O
a O
solid O
pyramid O
of O
fat O
. O
But O
the O
spermaceti O
itself O
, O
how O
bland O
and O
creamy O
that O
is O
; O
like O
the O
transparent O
, O
half-jellied O
, O
white O
meat O
of O
a O
cocoanut O
in O
the O
third O
month O
of O
its O
growth O
, O
yet O
far O
too O
rich O
to O
supply O
a O
substitute O
for O
butter O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
many O
whalemen O
have O
a O
method O
of O
absorbing O
it O
into O
some O
other O
substance O
, O
and O
then O
partaking O
of O
it O
. O
In O
the O
long O
try O
watches O
of O
the O
night O
it O
is O
a O
common O
thing O
for O
the O
seamen O
to O
dip O
their O
ship-biscuit O
into O
the O
huge O
oil-pots O
and O
let O
them O
fry O
there O
awhile O
. O
Many O
a O
good O
supper O
have O
I O
thus O
made O
. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
a O
small O
Sperm O
Whale O
the O
brains O
are O
accounted O
a O
fine O
dish O
. O
The O
casket O
of O
the O
skull O
is O
broken O
into O
with O
an O
axe O
, O
and O
the O
two O
plump O
, O
whitish O
lobes O
being O
withdrawn O
( O
precisely O
resembling O
two O
large O
puddings O
) O
, O
they O
are O
then O
mixed O
with O
flour O
, O
and O
cooked O
into O
a O
most O
delectable O
mess O
, O
in O
flavor O
somewhat O
resembling O
calves O
' O
head O
, O
which O
is O
quite O
a O
dish O
among O
some O
epicures O
; O
and O
every O
one O
knows O
that O
some O
young O
bucks O
among O
the O
epicures O
, O
by O
continually O
dining O
upon O
calves O
' O
brains O
, O
by O
and O
by O
get O
to O
have O
a O
little O
brains O
of O
their O
own O
, O
so O
as O
to O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
a O
calf O
's O
head O
from O
their O
own O
heads O
; O
which O
, O
indeed O
, O
requires O
uncommon O
discrimination O
. O
And O
that O
is O
the O
reason O
why O
a O
young O
buck O
with O
an O
intelligent O
looking O
calf O
's O
head O
before O
him O
, O
is O
somehow O
one O
of O
the O
saddest O
sights O
you O
can O
see O
. O
The O
head O
looks O
a O
sort O
of O
reproachfully O
at O
him O
, O
with O
an O
" O
Et O
tu O
Brute O
! O
" O
expression O
. O
It O
is O
not O
, O
perhaps O
, O
entirely O
because O
the O
whale O
is O
so O
excessively O
unctuous O
that O
landsmen O
seem O
to O
regard O
the O
eating O
of O
him O
with O
abhorrence O
; O
that O
appears O
to O
result O
, O
in O
some O
way O
, O
from O
the O
consideration O
before O
mentioned O
: O
_i.e._ O
that O
a O
man O
should O
eat O
a O
newly O
murdered O
thing O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
and O
eat O
it O
too O
by O
its O
own O
light O
. O
But O
no O
doubt O
the O
first O
man O
that O
ever O
murdered O
an O
ox O
was O
regarded O
as O
a O
murderer O
; O
perhaps O
he O
was O
hung O
; O
and O
if O
he O
had O
been O
put O
on O
his O
trial O
by O
oxen O
, O
he O
certainly O
would O
have O
been O
; O
and O
he O
certainly O
deserved O
it O
if O
any O
murderer O
does O
. O
Go O
to O
the O
meat-market O
of O
a O
Saturday O
night O
and O
see O
the O
crowds O
of O
live O
bipeds O
staring O
up O
at O
the O
long O
rows O
of O
dead O
quadrupeds O
. O
Does O
not O
that O
sight O
take O
a O
tooth O
out O
of O
the O
cannibal O
's O
jaw O
? O
Cannibals O
? O
who O
is O
not O
a O
cannibal O
? O
I O
tell O
you O
it O
will O
be O
more O
tolerable O
for O
the O
Fejee O
that O
salted O
down O
a O
lean O
missionary O
in O
his O
cellar O
against O
a O
coming O
famine O
; O
it O
will O
be O
more O
tolerable O
for O
that O
provident O
Fejee O
, O
I O
say O
, O
in O
the O
day O
of O
judgment O
, O
than O
for O
thee O
, O
civilized O
and O
enlightened O
gourmand O
, O
who O
nailest O
geese O
to O
the O
ground O
and O
feastest O
on O
their O
bloated O
livers O
in O
thy O
paté-de-foie-gras O
. O
But O
Stubb O
, O
he O
eats O
the O
whale O
by O
its O
own O
light O
, O
does O
he O
? O
and O
that O
is O
adding O
insult O
to O
injury O
, O
is O
it O
? O
Look O
at O
your O
knife-handle O
, O
there O
, O
my O
civilized O
and O
enlightened O
gourmand O
dining O
off O
that O
roast O
beef O
, O
what O
is O
that O
handle O
made O
of O
? O
—what O
but O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
brother O
of O
the O
very O
ox O
you O
are O
eating O
? O
And O
what O
do O
you O
pick O
your O
teeth O
with O
, O
after O
devouring O
that O
fat O
goose O
? O
With O
a O
feather O
of O
the O
same O
fowl O
. O
And O
with O
what O
quill O
did O
the O
Secretary O
of O
the O
Society O
for O
the O
Suppression O
of O
Cruelty O
to O
Ganders O
formally O
indite O
his O
circulars O
? O
It O
is O
only O
within O
the O
last O
month O
or O
two O
that O
that O
society O
passed O
a O
resolution O
to O
patronize O
nothing O
but O
steel O
pens O
