Now O
this O
ambergris O
is O
a O
very O
curious O
substance O
, O
and O
so O
important O
as O
an O
article O
of O
commerce O
, O
that O
in O
1791 O
a O
certain O
Nantucket-born O
Captain O
Coffin O
was O
examined O
at O
the O
bar O
of O
the O
English O
House O
of O
Commons O
on O
that O
subject O
. O
For O
at O
that O
time O
, O
and O
indeed O
until O
a O
comparatively O
late O
day O
, O
the O
precise O
origin O
of O
ambergris O
remained O
, O
like O
amber O
itself O
, O
a O
problem O
to O
the O
learned O
. O
Though O
the O
word O
ambergris O
is O
but O
the O
French O
compound O
for O
grey O
amber O
, O
yet O
the O
two O
substances O
are O
quite O
distinct O
. O
For O
amber O
, O
though O
at O
times O
found O
on O
the O
sea-coast O
, O
is O
also O
dug O
up O
in O
some O
far O
inland O
soils O
, O
whereas O
ambergris O
is O
never O
found O
except O
upon O
the O
sea O
. O
Besides O
, O
amber O
is O
a O
hard O
, O
transparent O
, O
brittle O
, O
odorless O
substance O
, O
used O
for O
mouth-pieces O
to O
pipes O
, O
for O
beads O
and O
ornaments O
; O
but O
ambergris O
is O
soft O
, O
waxy O
, O
and O
so O
highly O
fragrant O
and O
spicy O
, O
that O
it O
is O
largely O
used O
in O
perfumery O
, O
in O
pastiles O
, O
precious O
candles O
, O
hair-powders O
, O
and O
pomatum O
. O
The O
Turks O
use O
it O
in O
cooking O
, O
and O
also O
carry O
it O
to O
Mecca O
, O
for O
the O
same O
purpose O
that O
frankincense O
is O
carried O
to O
St. O
Peter O
's O
in O
Rome O
. O
Some O
wine O
merchants O
drop O
a O
few O
grains O
into O
claret O
, O
to O
flavor O
it O
. O
Who O
would O
think O
, O
then O
, O
that O
such O
fine O
ladies O
and O
gentlemen O
should O
regale O
themselves O
with O
an O
essence O
found O
in O
the O
inglorious O
bowels O
of O
a O
sick O
whale O
! O
Yet O
so O
it O
is O
. O
By O
some O
, O
ambergris O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
, O
and O
by O
others O
the O
effect O
, O
of O
the O
dyspepsia O
in O
the O
whale O
. O
How O
to O
cure O
such O
a O
dyspepsia O
it O
were O
hard O
to O
say O
, O
unless O
by O
administering O
three O
or O
four O
boat O
loads O
of O
Brandreth O
's O
pills O
, O
and O
then O
running O
out O
of O
harm O
's O
way O
, O
as O
laborers O
do O
in O
blasting O
rocks O
. O
I O
have O
forgotten O
to O
say O
that O
there O
were O
found O
in O
this O
ambergris O
, O
certain O
hard O
, O
round O
, O
bony O
plates O
, O
which O
at O
first O
Stubb O
thought O
might O
be O
sailors O
' O
trowsers O
buttons O
; O
but O
it O
afterwards O
turned O
out O
that O
they O
were O
nothing O
more O
than O
pieces O
of O
small O
squid O
bones O
embalmed O
in O
that O
manner O
. O
Now O
that O
the O
incorruption O
of O
this O
most O
fragrant O
ambergris O
should O
be O
found O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
such O
decay O
; O
is O
this O
nothing O
? O
Bethink O
thee O
of O
that O
saying O
of O
St. O
Paul O
in O
Corinthians O
, O
about O
corruption O
and O
incorruption O
; O
how O
that O
we O
are O
sown O
in O
dishonor O
, O
but O
raised O
in O
glory O
. O
And O
likewise O
call O
to O
mind O
that O
saying O
of O
Paracelsus O
about O
what O
it O
is O
that O
maketh O
the O
best O
musk O
. O
Also O
forget O
not O
the O
strange O
fact O
that O
of O
all O
things O
of O
ill-savor O
, O
Cologne-water O
, O
in O
its O
rudimental O
manufacturing O
stages O
, O
is O
the O
worst O
. O
I O
should O
like O
to O
conclude O
the O
chapter O
with O
the O
above O
appeal O
, O
but O
can O
not O
, O
owing O
to O
my O
anxiety O
to O
repel O
a O
charge O
often O
made O
against O
whalemen O
, O
and O
which O
, O
in O
the O
estimation O
of O
some O
already O
biased O
minds O
, O
might O
be O
considered O
as O
indirectly O
substantiated O
by O
what O
has O
been O
said O
of O
the O
Frenchman O
's O
two O
whales O
. O
Elsewhere O
in O
this O
volume O
the O
slanderous O
aspersion O
has O
been O
disproved O
, O
that O
the O
vocation O
of O
whaling O
is O
throughout O
a O
slatternly O
, O
untidy O
business O
. O
But O
there O
is O
another O
thing O
to O
rebut O
. O
They O
hint O
that O
all O
whales O
always O
smell O
bad O
. O
Now O
how O
did O
this O
odious O
stigma O
originate O
? O
I O
opine O
, O
that O
it O
is O
plainly O
traceable O
to O
the O
first O
arrival O
of O
the O
Greenland O
whaling O
ships O
in O
London O
, O
more O
than O
two O
centuries O
ago O
. O
Because O
those O
whalemen O
did O
not O
then O
, O
and O
do O
not O
now O
, O
try O
out O
their O
oil O
at O
sea O
as O
the O
Southern O
ships O
have O
always O
done O
; O
but O
cutting O
up O
the O
fresh O
blubber O
in O
small O
bits O
, O
thrust O
it O
through O
the O
bung O
holes O
of O
large O
casks O
, O
and O
carry O
it O
home O
in O
that O
manner O
; O
the O
shortness O
of O
the O
season O
in O
those O
Icy O
Seas O
, O
and O
the O
sudden O
and O
violent O
storms O
to O
which O
they O
are O
exposed O
, O
forbidding O
any O
other O
course O
. O
The O
consequence O
is O
, O
that O
upon O
breaking O
into O
the O
hold O
, O
and O
unloading O
one O
of O
these O
whale O
cemeteries O
, O
in O
the O
Greenland O
dock O
, O
a O
savor O
is O
given O
forth O
somewhat O
similar O
to O
that O
arising O
from O
excavating O
an O
old O
city O
grave-yard O
, O
for O
the O
foundations O
of O
a O
Lying-in O
Hospital O
. O
I O
partly O
surmise O
also O
, O
that O
this O
wicked O
charge O
against O
whalers O
may O
be O
likewise O
imputed O
to O
the O
existence O
on O
the O
coast O
of O
Greenland O
, O
in O
former O
times O
, O
of O
a O
Dutch O
village O
called O
Schmerenburgh O
or O
Smeerenberg O
, O
which O
latter O
name O
is O
the O
one O
used O
by O
the O
learned O
Fogo O
Von O
Slack O
, O
in O
his O
great O
work O
on O
Smells O
, O
a O
text-book O
on O
that O
subject O
. O
As O
its O
name O
imports O
( O
smeer O
, O
fat O
; O
berg O
, O
to O
put O
up O
) O
, O
this O
village O
was O
founded O
in O
order O
to O
afford O
a O
place O
for O
the O
blubber O
of O
the O
Dutch O
whale O
fleet O
to O
be O
tried O
out O
, O
without O
being O
taken O
home O
to O
Holland O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O
It O
was O
a O
collection O
of O
furnaces O
, O
fat-kettles O
, O
and O
oil O
sheds O
; O
and O
when O
the O
works O
were O
in O
full O
operation O
certainly O
gave O
forth O
no O
very O
pleasant O
savor O
. O
But O
all O
this O
is O
quite O
different O
with O
a O
South O
Sea O
Sperm O
Whaler O
; O
which O
in O
a O
voyage O
of O
four O
years O
perhaps O
, O
after O
completely O
filling O
her O
hold O
with O
oil O
, O
does O
not O
, O
perhaps O
, O
consume O
fifty O
days O
in O
the O
business O
of O
boiling O
out O
; O
and O
in O
the O
state O
that O
it O
is O
casked O
, O
the O
oil O
is O
nearly O
scentless O
. O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
that O
living O
or O
dead O
, O
if O
but O
decently O
treated O
, O
whales O
as O
a O
species O
are O
by O
no O
means O
creatures O
of O
ill O
odor O
; O
nor O
can O
whalemen O
be O
recognised O
, O
as O
the O
people O
of O
the O
middle O
ages O
affected O
to O
detect O
a O
Jew O
in O
the O
company O
, O
by O
the O
nose O
. O
Nor O
indeed O
can O
the O
whale O
possibly O
be O
otherwise O
than O
fragrant O
, O
when O
, O
as O
a O
general O
thing O
, O
he O
enjoys O
such O
high O
health O
; O
taking O
abundance O
of O
exercise O
; O
always O
out O
of O
doors O
; O
though O
, O
it O
is O
true O
, O
seldom O
in O
the O
open O
air O
. O
I O
say O
, O
that O
the O
motion O
of O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
flukes O
above O
water O
dispenses O
a O
perfume O
, O
as O
when O
a O
musk-scented O
lady O
rustles O
her O
dress O
in O
a O
warm O
parlor O
. O
What O
then O
shall O
I O
liken O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
to O
for O
fragrance O
, O
considering O
his O
magnitude O
? O
Must O
it O
not O
be O
to O
that O
famous O
elephant O
, O
with O
jewelled O
tusks O
, O
and O
redolent O
with O
myrrh O
, O
which O
was O
led O
out O
of O
an O
Indian O
town O
to O
do O
honor O
to O
Alexander O
the O
Great O
? O
