At O
length O
, O
towards O
noon O
, O
upon O
the O
final O
dismissal O
of O
the O
ship O
's O
riggers O
, O
and O
after O
the O
Pequod O
had O
been O
hauled O
out O
from O
the O
wharf O
, O
and O
after O
the O
ever-thoughtful O
Charity O
had O
come O
off O
in O
a O
whale-boat O
, O
with O
her O
last O
gift—a O
night-cap O
for O
Stubb O
, O
the O
second O
mate O
, O
her O
brother-in-law O
, O
and O
a O
spare O
Bible O
for O
the O
steward—after O
all O
this O
, O
the O
two O
Captains O
, O
Peleg O
and O
Bildad O
, O
issued O
from O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
turning O
to O
the O
chief O
mate O
, O
Peleg O
said O
: O
" O
Now O
, O
Mr. O
Starbuck O
, O
are O
you O
sure O
everything O
is O
right O
? O
Captain O
Ahab O
is O
all O
ready—just O
spoke O
to O
him—nothing O
more O
to O
be O
got O
from O
shore O
, O
eh O
? O
Well O
, O
call O
all O
hands O
, O
then O
. O
Muster O
'em O
aft O
here—blast O
'em O
! O
" O
" O
No O
need O
of O
profane O
words O
, O
however O
great O
the O
hurry O
, O
Peleg O
, O
" O
said O
Bildad O
, O
" O
but O
away O
with O
thee O
, O
friend O
Starbuck O
, O
and O
do O
our O
bidding O
. O
" O
How O
now O
! O
Here O
upon O
the O
very O
point O
of O
starting O
for O
the O
voyage O
, O
Captain O
Peleg O
and O
Captain O
Bildad O
were O
going O
it O
with O
a O
high O
hand O
on O
the O
quarter-deck O
, O
just O
as O
if O
they O
were O
to O
be O
joint-commanders O
at O
sea O
, O
as O
well O
as O
to O
all O
appearances O
in O
port O
. O
And O
, O
as O
for O
Captain O
Ahab O
, O
no O
sign O
of O
him O
was O
yet O
to O
be O
seen O
; O
only O
, O
they O
said O
he O
was O
in O
the O
cabin O
. O
But O
then O
, O
the O
idea O
was O
, O
that O
his O
presence O
was O
by O
no O
means O
necessary O
in O
getting O
the O
ship O
under O
weigh O
, O
and O
steering O
her O
well O
out O
to O
sea O
. O
Indeed O
, O
as O
that O
was O
not O
at O
all O
his O
proper O
business O
, O
but O
the O
pilot O
's O
; O
and O
as O
he O
was O
not O
yet O
completely O
recovered—so O
they O
said—therefore O
, O
Captain O
Ahab O
stayed O
below O
. O
And O
all O
this O
seemed O
natural O
enough O
; O
especially O
as O
in O
the O
merchant O
service O
many O
captains O
never O
show O
themselves O
on O
deck O
for O
a O
considerable O
time O
after O
heaving O
up O
the O
anchor O
, O
but O
remain O
over O
the O
cabin O
table O
, O
having O
a O
farewell O
merry-making O
with O
their O
shore O
friends O
, O
before O
they O
quit O
the O
ship O
for O
good O
with O
the O
pilot O
. O
But O
there O
was O
not O
much O
chance O
to O
think O
over O
the O
matter O
, O
for O
Captain O
Peleg O
was O
now O
all O
alive O
. O
He O
seemed O
to O
do O
most O
of O
the O
talking O
and O
commanding O
, O
and O
not O
Bildad O
. O
" O
Aft O
here O
, O
ye O
sons O
of O
bachelors O
, O
" O
he O
cried O
, O
as O
the O
sailors O
lingered O
at O
the O
main-mast O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Starbuck O
, O
drive O
'em O
aft O
. O
" O
" O
Strike O
the O
tent O
there O
! O
" O
—was O
the O
next O
order O
. O
As O
I O
hinted O
before O
, O
this O
whalebone O
marquee O
was O
never O
pitched O
except O
in O
port O
; O
and O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod O
, O
for O
thirty O
years O
, O
the O
order O
to O
strike O
the O
tent O
was O
well O
known O
to O
be O
the O
next O
thing O
to O
heaving O
up O
the O
anchor O
. O
" O
Man O
the O
capstan O
! O
Blood O
and O
thunder O
! O
—jump O
! O
" O
—was O
the O
next O
command O
, O
and O
the O
crew O
sprang O
for O
the O
handspikes O
. O
Now O
in O
getting O
under O
weigh O
, O
the O
station O
generally O
occupied O
by O
the O
pilot O
is O
the O
forward O
part O
of O
the O
ship O
. O
And O
here O
Bildad O
, O
who O
, O
with O
Peleg O
, O
be O
it O
known O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
other O
officers O
, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
licensed O
pilots O
of O
the O
port—he O
being O
suspected O
to O
have O
got O
himself O
made O
a O
pilot O
in O
order O
to O
save O
the O
Nantucket O
pilot-fee O
to O
all O
the O
ships O
he O
was O
concerned O
in O
, O
for O
he O
never O
piloted O
any O
other O
craft—Bildad O
, O
I O
say O
, O
might O
now O
be O
seen O
actively O
engaged O
in O
looking O
over O
the O
bows O
for O
the O
approaching O
anchor O
, O
and O
at O
intervals O
singing O
what O
seemed O
a O
dismal O
stave O
of O
psalmody O
, O
to O
cheer O
the O
hands O
at O
the O
windlass O
, O
who O
roared O
forth O
some O
sort O
of O
a O
chorus O
about O
the O
girls O
in O
Booble O
Alley O
, O
with O
hearty O
good O
will O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
not O
three O
days O
previous O
, O
Bildad O
had O
told O
them O
that O
no O
profane O
songs O
would O
be O
allowed O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod O
, O
particularly O
in O
getting O
under O
weigh O
; O
and O
Charity O
, O
his O
sister O
, O
had O
placed O
a O
small O
choice O
copy O
of O
Watts O
in O
each O
seaman O
's O
berth O
. O
Meantime O
, O
overseeing O
the O
other O
part O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
Captain O
Peleg O
ripped O
and O
swore O
astern O
in O
the O
most O
frightful O
manner O
. O
I O
almost O
thought O
he O
would O
sink O
the O
ship O
before O
the O
anchor O
could O
be O
got O
up O
; O
involuntarily O
I O
paused O
on O
my O
handspike O
, O
and O
told O
Queequeg O
to O
do O
the O
same O
, O
thinking O
of O
the O
perils O
we O
both O
ran O
, O
in O
starting O
on O
the O
voyage O
with O
such O
a O
devil O
for O
a O
pilot O
. O
I O
was O
comforting O
myself O
, O
however O
, O
with O
the O
thought O
that O
in O
pious O
Bildad O
might O
be O
found O
some O
salvation O
, O
spite O
of O
his O
seven O
hundred O
and O
seventy-seventh O
lay O
; O
when O
I O
felt O
a O
sudden O
sharp O
poke O
in O
my O
rear O
, O
and O
turning O
round O
, O
was O
horrified O
at O
the O
apparition O
of O
Captain O
Peleg O
in O
the O
act O
of O
withdrawing O
his O
leg O
from O
my O
immediate O
vicinity O
. O
That O
was O
my O
first O
kick O
. O
" O
Is O
that O
the O
way O
they O
heave O
in O
the O
marchant O
service O
? O
" O
he O
roared O
. O
" O
Spring O
, O
thou O
sheep-head O
; O
spring O
, O
and O
break O
thy O
backbone O
! O
Why O
do O
n't O
ye O
spring O
, O
I O
say O
, O
all O
of O
ye—spring O
! O
Quohog O
! O
spring O
, O
thou O
chap O
with O
the O
red O
whiskers O
; O
spring O
there O
, O
Scotch-cap O
; O
spring O
, O
thou O
green O
pants O
. O
Spring O
, O
I O
say O
, O
all O
of O
ye O
, O
and O
spring O
your O
eyes O
out O
! O
" O
And O
so O
saying O
, O
he O
moved O
along O
the O
windlass O
, O
here O
and O
there O
using O
his O
leg O
very O
freely O
, O
while O
imperturbable O
Bildad O
kept O
leading O
off O
with O
his O
psalmody O
. O
Thinks O
I O
, O
Captain O
Peleg O
must O
have O
been O
drinking O
something O
to-day O
. O
At O
last O
the O
anchor O
was O
up O
, O
the O
sails O
were O
set O
, O
and O
off O
we O
glided O
. O
It O
was O
a O
short O
, O
cold O
Christmas O
; O
and O
as O
the O
short O
northern O
day O
merged O
into O
night O
, O
we O
found O
ourselves O
almost O
broad O
upon O
the O
wintry O
ocean O
, O
whose O
freezing O
spray O
cased O
us O
in O
ice O
, O
as O
in O
polished O
armor O
. O
The O
long O
rows O
of O
teeth O
on O
the O
bulwarks O
glistened O
in O
the O
moonlight O
; O
and O
like O
the O
white O
ivory O
tusks O
of O
some O
huge O
elephant O
, O
vast O
curving O
icicles O
depended O
from O
the O
bows O
. O
Lank O
Bildad O
, O
as O
pilot O
, O
headed O
the O
first O
watch O
, O
and O
ever O
and O
anon O
, O
as O
the O
old O
craft O
deep O
dived O
into O
the O
green O
seas O
, O
and O
sent O
the O
shivering O
frost O
all O
over O
her O
, O
and O
the O
winds O
howled O
, O
and O
the O
cordage O
rang O
, O
his O
steady O
notes O
were O
heard O
, O
— O
_ O
" O
Sweet O
fields O
beyond O
the O
swelling O
flood O
, O
Stand O
dressed O
in O
living O
green O
. O
So O
to O
the O
Jews O
old O
Canaan O
stood O
, O
While O
Jordan O
rolled O
between O
. O
" O
_ O
Never O
did O
those O
sweet O
words O
sound O
more O
sweetly O
to O
me O
than O
then O
. O
They O
were O
full O
of O
hope O
and O
fruition O
. O
Spite O
of O
this O
frigid O
winter O
night O
in O
the O
boisterous O
Atlantic O
, O
spite O
of O
my O
wet O
feet O
and O
wetter O
jacket O
, O
there O
was O
yet O
, O
it O
then O
seemed O
to O
me O
, O
many O
a O
pleasant O
haven O
in O
store O
; O
and O
meads O
and O
glades O
so O
eternally O
vernal O
, O
that O
the O
grass O
shot O
up O
by O
the O
spring O
, O
untrodden O
, O
unwilted O
, O
remains O
at O
midsummer O
. O
At O
last O
we O
gained O
such O
an O
offing O
, O
that O
the O
two O
pilots O
were O
needed O
no O
longer O
. O
The O
stout O
sail-boat O
that O
had O
accompanied O
us O
began O
ranging O
alongside O
. O
It O
was O
curious O
and O
not O
unpleasing O
, O
how O
Peleg O
and O
Bildad O
were O
affected O
at O
this O
juncture O
, O
especially O
Captain O
Bildad O
. O
For O
loath O
to O
depart O
, O
yet O
; O
very O
loath O
to O
leave O
, O
for O
good O
, O
a O
ship O
bound O
on O
so O
long O
and O
perilous O
a O
voyage—beyond O
both O
stormy O
Capes O
; O
a O
ship O
in O
which O
some O
thousands O
of O
his O
hard O
earned O
dollars O
were O
invested O
; O
a O
ship O
, O
in O
which O
an O
old O
shipmate O
sailed O
as O
captain O
; O
a O
man O
almost O
as O
old O
as O
he O
, O
once O
more O
starting O
to O
encounter O
all O
the O
terrors O
of O
the O
pitiless O
jaw O
; O
loath O
to O
say O
good-bye O
to O
a O
thing O
so O
every O
way O
brimful O
of O
every O
interest O
to O
him O
, O
—poor O
old O
Bildad O
lingered O
long O
; O
paced O
the O
deck O
with O
anxious O
strides O
; O
ran O
down O
into O
the O
cabin O
to O
speak O
another O
farewell O
word O
there O
; O
again O
came O
on O
deck O
, O
and O
looked O
to O
windward O
; O
looked O
towards O
the O
wide O
and O
endless O
waters O
, O
only O
bounded O
by O
the O
far-off O
unseen O
Eastern O
Continents O
; O
looked O
towards O
the O
land O
; O
looked O
aloft O
; O
looked O
right O
and O
left O
; O
looked O
everywhere O
and O
nowhere O
; O
and O
at O
last O
, O
mechanically O
coiling O
a O
rope O
upon O
its O
pin O
, O
convulsively O
grasped O
stout O
Peleg O
by O
the O
hand O
, O
and O
holding O
up O
a O
lantern O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
stood O
gazing O
heroically O
in O
his O
face O
, O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say O
, O
" O
Nevertheless O
, O
friend O
Peleg O
, O
I O
can O
stand O
it O
; O
yes O
, O
I O
can O
. O
" O
As O
for O
Peleg O
himself O
, O
he O
took O
it O
more O
like O
a O
philosopher O
; O
but O
for O
all O
his O
philosophy O
, O
there O
was O
a O
tear O
twinkling O
in O
his O
eye O
, O
when O
the O
lantern O
came O
too O
near O
. O
And O
he O
, O
too O
, O
did O
not O
a O
little O
run O
from O
cabin O
to O
deck—now O
a O
word O
below O
, O
and O
now O
a O
word O
with O
Starbuck O
, O
the O
chief O
mate O
. O
But O
, O
at O
last O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
his O
comrade O
, O
with O
a O
final O
sort O
of O
look O
about O
him O
, O
— O
" O
Captain O
Bildad—come O
, O
old O
shipmate O
, O
we O
must O
go O
. O
Back O
the O
main-yard O
there O
! O
Boat O
ahoy O
! O
Stand O
by O
to O
come O
close O
alongside O
, O
now O
! O
Careful O
, O
careful O

Bildad O
, O
boy—say O
your O
last O
. O

Mr. O
Stubb—luck O

Mr. O
Flask—good-bye O

good O
luck O
to O
ye O
all—and O
this O
day O
three O
years O
I O
'll O
have O
a O
hot O
supper O
smoking O
for O
ye O
in O
old O
Nantucket O

Hurrah O

God O
bless O
ye O

and O

ye O
in O
His O
holy O
keeping O
, O
men O
, O
" O
murmured O
old O
Bildad O
, O
almost O
incoherently O
. O
" O
I O
hope O
ye O
'll O
have O
fine O
weather O
now O
, O
so O
that O
Captain O
Ahab O
may O
soon O
be O
moving O
among O

pleasant O
sun O

all O
he O
needs O
, O
and O
ye O
'll O
have O
plenty O
of O

with O
that O

Peleg O
hurried O
him O
over O

rolled O

we O
gave O
three O
heavy-hearted O
