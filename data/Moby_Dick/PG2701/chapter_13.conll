Next O
morning O
, O
Monday O
, O
after O
disposing O
of O
the O
embalmed O
head O
to O
a O
barber O
, O
for O
a O
block O
, O
I O
settled O
my O
own O
and O
comrade O
's O
bill O
; O
using O
, O
however O
, O
my O
comrade O
's O
money O
. O
The O
grinning O
landlord O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
boarders O
, O
seemed O
amazingly O
tickled O
at O
the O
sudden O
friendship O
which O
had O
sprung O
up O
between O
me O
and O
Queequeg—especially O
as O
Peter O
Coffin O
's O
cock O
and O
bull O
stories O
about O
him O
had O
previously O
so O
much O
alarmed O
me O
concerning O
the O
very O
person O
whom O
I O
now O
companied O
with O
. O
We O
borrowed O
a O
wheelbarrow O
, O
and O
embarking O
our O
things O
, O
including O
my O
own O
poor O
carpet-bag O
, O
and O
Queequeg O
's O
canvas O
sack O
and O
hammock O
, O
away O
we O
went O
down O
to O
" O
the O
Moss O
, O
" O
the O
little O
Nantucket O
packet O
schooner O
moored O
at O
the O
wharf O
. O
As O
we O
were O
going O
along O
the O
people O
stared O
; O
not O
at O
Queequeg O
so O
much—for O
they O
were O
used O
to O
seeing O
cannibals O
like O
him O
in O
their O
streets O
, O
—but O
at O
seeing O
him O
and O
me O
upon O
such O
confidential O
terms O
. O
But O
we O
heeded O
them O
not O
, O
going O
along O
wheeling O
the O
barrow O
by O
turns O
, O
and O
Queequeg O
now O
and O
then O
stopping O
to O
adjust O
the O
sheath O
on O
his O
harpoon O
barbs O
. O
I O
asked O
him O
why O
he O
carried O
such O
a O
troublesome O
thing O
with O
him O
ashore O
, O
and O
whether O
all O
whaling O
ships O
did O
not O
find O
their O
own O
harpoons O
. O
To O
this O
, O
in O
substance O
, O
he O
replied O
, O
that O
though O
what O
I O
hinted O
was O
true O
enough O
, O
yet O
he O
had O
a O
particular O
affection O
for O
his O
own O
harpoon O
, O
because O
it O
was O
of O
assured O
stuff O
, O
well O
tried O
in O
many O
a O
mortal O
combat O
, O
and O
deeply O
intimate O
with O
the O
hearts O
of O
whales O
. O
In O
short O
, O
like O
many O
inland O
reapers O
and O
mowers O
, O
who O
go O
into O
the O
farmers O
' O
meadows O
armed O
with O
their O
own O
scythes—though O
in O
no O
wise O
obliged O
to O
furnish O
them—even O
so O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
for O
his O
own O
private O
reasons O
, O
preferred O
his O
own O
harpoon O
. O
Shifting O
the O
barrow O
from O
my O
hand O
to O
his O
, O
he O
told O
me O
a O
funny O
story O
about O
the O
first O
wheelbarrow O
he O
had O
ever O
seen O
. O
It O
was O
in O
Sag O
Harbor O
. O
The O
owners O
of O
his O
ship O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
had O
lent O
him O
one O
, O
in O
which O
to O
carry O
his O
heavy O
chest O
to O
his O
boarding O
house O
. O
Not O
to O
seem O
ignorant O
about O
the O
thing—though O
in O
truth O
he O
was O
entirely O
so O
, O
concerning O
the O
precise O
way O
in O
which O
to O
manage O
the O
barrow—Queequeg O
puts O
his O
chest O
upon O
it O
; O
lashes O
it O
fast O
; O
and O
then O
shoulders O
the O
barrow O
and O
marches O
up O
the O
wharf O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
Queequeg O
, O
you O
might O
have O
known O
better O
than O
that O
, O
one O
would O
think O
. O
Did O
n't O
the O
people O
laugh O
? O
" O
Upon O
this O
, O
he O
told O
me O
another O
story O
. O
The O
people O
of O
his O
island O
of O
Rokovoko O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
at O
their O
wedding O
feasts O
express O
the O
fragrant O
water O
of O
young O
cocoanuts O
into O
a O
large O
stained O
calabash O
like O
a O
punchbowl O
; O
and O
this O
punchbowl O
always O
forms O
the O
great O
central O
ornament O
on O
the O
braided O
mat O
where O
the O
feast O
is O
held O
. O
Now O
a O
certain O
grand O
merchant O
ship O
once O
touched O
at O
Rokovoko O
, O
and O
its O
commander—from O
all O
accounts O
, O
a O
very O
stately O
punctilious O
gentleman O
, O
at O
least O
for O
a O
sea O
captain—this O
commander O
was O
invited O
to O
the O
wedding O
feast O
of O
Queequeg O
's O
sister O
, O
a O
pretty O
young O
princess O
just O
turned O
of O
ten O
. O
Well O
; O
when O
all O
the O
wedding O
guests O
were O
assembled O
at O
the O
bride O
's O
bamboo O
cottage O
, O
this O
Captain O
marches O
in O
, O
and O
being O
assigned O
the O
post O
of O
honor O
, O
placed O
himself O
over O
against O
the O
punchbowl O
, O
and O
between O
the O
High O
Priest O
and O
his O
majesty O
the O
King O
, O
Queequeg O
's O
father O
. O
Grace O
being O
said O
, O
—for O
those O
people O
have O
their O
grace O
as O
well O
as O
we—though O
Queequeg O
told O
me O
that O
unlike O
us O
, O
who O
at O
such O
times O
look O
downwards O
to O
our O
platters O
, O
they O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
copying O
the O
ducks O
, O
glance O
upwards O
to O
the O
great O
Giver O
of O
all O
feasts—Grace O
, O
I O
say O
, O
being O
said O
, O
the O
High O
Priest O
opens O
the O
banquet O
by O
the O
immemorial O
ceremony O
of O
the O
island O
; O
that O
is O
, O
dipping O
his O
consecrated O
and O
consecrating O
fingers O
into O
the O
bowl O
before O
the O
blessed O
beverage O
circulates O
. O
Seeing O
himself O
placed O
next O
the O
Priest O
, O
and O
noting O
the O
ceremony O
, O
and O
thinking O
himself—being O
Captain O
of O
a O
ship—as O
having O
plain O
precedence O
over O
a O
mere O
island O
King O
, O
especially O
in O
the O
King O
's O
own O
house—the O
Captain O
coolly O
proceeds O
to O
wash O
his O
hands O
in O
the O
punchbowl O
; O
—taking O
it O
I O
suppose O
for O
a O
huge O
finger-glass O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
" O
said O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
what O
you O
tink O
now O
? O
—Did O
n't O
our O
people O
laugh O
? O
" O
At O
last O
, O
passage O
paid O
, O
and O
luggage O
safe O
, O
we O
stood O
on O
board O
the O
schooner O
. O
Hoisting O
sail O
, O
it O
glided O
down O
the O
Acushnet O
river O
. O
On O
one O
side O
, O
New O
Bedford O
rose O
in O
terraces O
of O
streets O
, O
their O
ice-covered O
trees O
all O
glittering O
in O
the O
clear O
, O
cold O
air O
. O
Huge O
hills O
and O
mountains O
of O
casks O
on O
casks O
were O
piled O
upon O
her O
wharves O
, O
and O
side O
by O
side O
the O
world-wandering O
whale O
ships O
lay O
silent O
and O
safely O
moored O
at O
last O
; O
while O
from O
others O
came O
a O
sound O
of O
carpenters O
and O
coopers O
, O
with O
blended O
noises O
of O
fires O
and O
forges O
to O
melt O
the O
pitch O
, O
all O
betokening O
that O
new O
cruises O
were O
on O
the O
start O
; O
that O
one O
most O
perilous O
and O
long O
voyage O
ended O
, O
only O
begins O
a O
second O
; O
and O
a O
second O
ended O
, O
only O
begins O
a O
third O
, O
and O
so O
on O
, O
for O
ever O
and O
for O
aye O
. O
Such O
is O
the O
endlessness O
, O
yea O
, O
the O
intolerableness O
of O
all O
earthly O
effort O
. O
Gaining O
the O
more O
open O
water O
, O
the O
bracing O
breeze O
waxed O
fresh O
; O
the O
little O
Moss O
tossed O
the O
quick O
foam O
from O
her O
bows O
, O
as O
a O
young O
colt O
his O
snortings O
. O
How O
I O
snuffed O
that O
Tartar O
air O
! O
—how O
I O
spurned O
that O
turnpike O
earth O
! O
—that O
common O
highway O
all O
over O
dented O
with O
the O
marks O
of O
slavish O
heels O
and O
hoofs O
; O
and O
turned O
me O
to O
admire O
the O
magnanimity O
of O
the O
sea O
which O
will O
permit O
no O
records O
. O
At O
the O
same O
foam-fountain O
, O
Queequeg O
seemed O
to O
drink O
and O
reel O
with O
me O
. O
His O
dusky O
nostrils O
swelled O
apart O
; O
he O
showed O
his O
filed O
and O
pointed O
teeth O
. O
On O
, O
on O
we O
flew O
; O
and O
our O
offing O
gained O
, O
the O
Moss O
did O
homage O
to O
the O
blast O
; O
ducked O
and O
dived O
her O
bows O
as O
a O
slave O
before O
the O
Sultan O
. O
Sideways O
leaning O
, O
we O
sideways O
darted O
; O
every O
ropeyarn O
tingling O
like O
a O
wire O
; O
the O
two O
tall O
masts O
buckling O
like O
Indian O
canes O
in O
land O
tornadoes O
. O
So O
full O
of O
this O
reeling O
scene O
were O
we O
, O
as O
we O
stood O
by O
the O
plunging O
bowsprit O
, O
that O
for O
some O
time O
we O
did O
not O
notice O
the O
jeering O
glances O
of O
the O
passengers O
, O
a O
lubber-like O
assembly O
, O
who O
marvelled O
that O
two O
fellow O
beings O
should O
be O
so O
companionable O
; O
as O
though O
a O
white O
man O
were O
anything O
more O
dignified O
than O
a O
whitewashed O
negro O
. O
But O
there O
were O
some O
boobies O
and O
bumpkins O
there O
, O
who O
, O
by O
their O
intense O
greenness O
, O
must O
have O
come O
from O
the O
heart O
and O
centre O
of O
all O
verdure O
. O
Queequeg O
caught O
one O
of O
these O
young O
saplings O
mimicking O
him O
behind O
his O
back O
. O
I O
thought O
the O
bumpkin O
's O
hour O
of O
doom O
was O
come O
. O
Dropping O
his O
harpoon O
, O
the O
brawny O
savage O
caught O
him O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
and O
by O
an O
almost O
miraculous O
dexterity O
and O
strength O
, O
sent O
him O
high O
up O
bodily O
into O
the O
air O
; O
then O
slightly O
tapping O
his O
stern O
in O
mid-somerset O
, O
the O
fellow O
landed O
with O
bursting O
lungs O
upon O
his O
feet O
, O
while O
Queequeg O
, O
turning O
his O
back O
upon O
him O
, O
lighted O
his O
tomahawk O
pipe O
and O
passed O
it O
to O
me O
for O
a O
puff O
. O
" O
Capting O
! O
Capting O
! O
" O
yelled O
the O
bumpkin O
, O
running O
towards O
that O
officer O
; O
" O
Capting O
, O
Capting O
, O
here O
's O
the O
devil O
. O
" O
" O
Hallo O
, O
_you_ O
sir O
, O
" O
cried O
the O
Captain O
, O
a O
gaunt O
rib O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
stalking O
up O
to O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
what O
in O
thunder O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
? O
Do O
n't O
you O
know O
you O
might O
have O
killed O
that O
chap O
? O
" O
" O
What O
him O
say O
? O
" O
said O
Queequeg O
, O
as O
he O
mildly O
turned O
to O
me O
. O
" O
He O
say O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
that O
you O
came O
near O
kill-e O
that O
man O
there O
, O
" O
pointing O
to O
the O
still O
shivering O
greenhorn O
. O
" O
Kill-e O
, O
" O
cried O
Queequeg O
, O
twisting O
his O
tattooed O
face O
into O
an O
unearthly O
expression O
of O
disdain O
, O
" O
ah O
! O
him O
bevy O
small-e O
fish-e O
; O
Queequeg O
no O
kill-e O
so O
small-e O
fish-e O
; O
Queequeg O
kill-e O
big O
whale O
! O
" O
" O
Look O
you O
, O
" O
roared O
the O
Captain O
, O
" O
I O
'll O
kill-e O
_you_ O
, O
you O
cannibal O
, O
if O
you O
try O
any O
more O
of O
your O
tricks O
aboard O
here O
; O
so O
mind O
your O
eye O
. O
" O
But O
it O
so O
happened O
just O
then O
, O
that O
it O
was O
high O
time O
for O
the O
Captain O
to O
mind O
his O
own O
eye O
. O
The O
prodigious O
strain O
upon O
the O
main-sail O
had O
parted O
the O
weather-sheet O
, O
and O
the O
tremendous O
boom O
was O
now O
flying O
from O
side O
to O
side O
, O
completely O
sweeping O
the O
entire O
after O
part O
of O
the O
deck O
. O
The O
poor O
fellow O
whom O
Queequeg O
had O
handled O
so O
roughly O
, O
was O
swept O
overboard O
; O
all O
hands O
were O
in O
a O
panic O
; O
and O
to O
attempt O
snatching O
at O
the O
boom O
to O
stay O
it O
, O
seemed O
madness O
. O
It O
flew O
from O
right O
to O
left O
, O
and O
back O
again O
, O
almost O
in O
one O
ticking O
of O
a O
watch O
, O
and O
every O
instant O
seemed O
on O
the O
point O
of O
snapping O
into O
splinters O
. O
Nothing O
was O
done O
, O
and O
nothing O
seemed O
capable O
of O
being O
done O
; O
those O
on O
deck O
rushed O
towards O
the O
bows O
, O
and O
stood O
eyeing O
the O
boom O
as O
if O
it O
were O
the O
lower O
jaw O
of O
an O
exasperated O
whale O
. O
In O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
consternation O
, O
Queequeg O
dropped O
deftly O
to O
his O
knees O
, O
and O
crawling O
under O
the O
path O
of O
the O
boom O
, O
whipped O
hold O
of O
a O
rope O
, O
secured O
one O
end O
to O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
then O
flinging O
the O
other O
like O
a O
lasso O
, O
caught O
it O
round O
the O
boom O
as O
it O
swept O
over O
his O
head O
, O
and O
at O
the O
next O
jerk O
, O
the O
spar O
was O
that O
way O
trapped O
, O
and O
all O
was O
safe O
. O
The O
schooner O
was O
run O
into O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
while O
the O
hands O
were O
clearing O
away O
the O
stern O
boat O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
stripped O
to O
the O
waist O
, O
darted O
from O
the O
side O
with O
a O
long O
living O
arc O
of O
a O
leap O
. O
For O
three O
minutes O
or O
more O
he O
was O
seen O
swimming O
like O
a O
dog O
, O
throwing O
his O
long O
arms O
straight O
out O
before O
him O
, O
and O
by O
turns O
revealing O
his O
brawny O
shoulders O
through O
the O
freezing O
foam O
. O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
grand O
and O
glorious O
fellow O
, O
but O
saw O
no O
one O
to O
be O
saved O
. O
The O
greenhorn O
had O
gone O
down O
. O
Shooting O
himself O
perpendicularly O
from O
the O
water O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
now O
took O
an O
instant O
's O
glance O
around O
him O
, O
and O
seeming O
to O
see O
just O
how O
matters O
were O
, O
dived O
down O
and O
disappeared O
. O
A O
few O
minutes O
more O
, O
and O
he O
rose O
again O
, O
one O
arm O
still O
striking O
out O
, O
and O
with O
the O
other O
dragging O
a O
lifeless O
form O
. O
The O
boat O
soon O
picked O
them O
up O
. O
The O
poor O
bumpkin O
was O
restored O
. O
All O
hands O
voted O
Queequeg O
a O
noble O
trump O
; O
the O
captain O
begged O
his O
pardon O
. O
From O
that O
hour O
I O
clove O
to O
Queequeg O
like O
a O
barnacle O
; O
yea O
, O
till O
poor O
Queequeg O
took O
his O
last O
long O
dive O
. O
Was O
there O
ever O
such O
unconsciousness O
? O
He O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
think O
that O
he O
at O
all O
deserved O
a O
medal O
from O
the O
Humane O
and O
Magnanimous O
Societies O
. O
He O
only O
asked O
for O
water—fresh O
water—something O
to O
wipe O
the O
brine O
off O
; O
that O
done O
, O
he O
put O
on O
dry O
clothes O
, O
lighted O
his O
pipe O
, O
and O
leaning O
against O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
