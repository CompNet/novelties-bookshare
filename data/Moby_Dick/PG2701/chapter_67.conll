It O
was O
a O
Saturday O
night O
, O
and O
such O
a O
Sabbath O
as O
followed O
! O
Ex O
officio O
professors O
of O
Sabbath O
breaking O
are O
all O
whalemen O
. O
The O
ivory O
Pequod O
was O
turned O
into O
what O
seemed O
a O
shamble O
; O
every O
sailor O
a O
butcher O
. O
You O
would O
have O
thought O
we O
were O
offering O
up O
ten O
thousand O
red O
oxen O
to O
the O
sea O
gods O
. O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
the O
enormous O
cutting O
tackles O
, O
among O
other O
ponderous O
things O
comprising O
a O
cluster O
of O
blocks O
generally O
painted O
green O
, O
and O
which O
no O
single O
man O
can O
possibly O
liftâ€”this O
vast O
bunch O
of O
grapes O
was O
swayed O
up O
to O
the O
main-top O
and O
firmly O
lashed O
to O
the O
lower O
mast-head O
, O
the O
strongest O
point O
anywhere O
above O
a O
ship O
's O
deck O
. O
The O
end O
of O
the O
hawser-like O
rope O
winding O
through O
these O
intricacies O
, O
was O
then O
conducted O
to O
the O
windlass O
, O
and O
the O
huge O
lower O
block O
of O
the O
tackles O
was O
swung O
over O
the O
whale O
; O
to O
this O
block O
the O
great O
blubber O
hook O
, O
weighing O
some O
one O
hundred O
pounds O
, O
was O
attached O
. O
And O
now O
suspended O
in O
stages O
over O
the O
side O
, O
Starbuck O
and O
Stubb O
, O
the O
mates O
, O
armed O
with O
their O
long O
spades O
, O
began O
cutting O
a O
hole O
in O
the O
body O
for O
the O
insertion O
of O
the O
hook O
just O
above O
the O
nearest O
of O
the O
two O
side-fins O
. O
This O
done O
, O
a O
broad O
, O
semicircular O
line O
is O
cut O
round O
the O
hole O
, O
the O
hook O
is O
inserted O
, O
and O
the O
main O
body O
of O
the O
crew O
striking O
up O
a O
wild O
chorus O
, O
now O
commence O
heaving O
in O
one O
dense O
crowd O
at O
the O
windlass O
. O
When O
instantly O
, O
the O
entire O
ship O
careens O
over O
on O
her O
side O
; O
every O
bolt O
in O
her O
starts O
like O
the O
nail-heads O
of O
an O
old O
house O
in O
frosty O
weather O
; O
she O
trembles O
, O
quivers O
, O
and O
nods O
her O
frighted O
mast-heads O
to O
the O
sky O
. O
More O
and O
more O
she O
leans O
over O
to O
the O
whale O
, O
while O
every O
gasping O
heave O
of O
the O
windlass O
is O
answered O
by O
a O
helping O
heave O
from O
the O
billows O
; O
till O
at O
last O
, O
a O
swift O
, O
startling O
snap O
is O
heard O
; O
with O
a O
great O
swash O
the O
ship O
rolls O
upwards O
and O
backwards O
from O
the O
whale O
, O
and O
the O
triumphant O
tackle O
rises O
into O
sight O
dragging O
after O
it O
the O
disengaged O
semicircular O
end O
of O
the O
first O
strip O
of O
blubber O
. O
Now O
as O
the O
blubber O
envelopes O
the O
whale O
precisely O
as O
the O
rind O
does O
an O
orange O
, O
so O
is O
it O
stripped O
off O
from O
the O
body O
precisely O
as O
an O
orange O
is O
sometimes O
stripped O
by O
spiralizing O
it O
. O
For O
the O
strain O
constantly O
kept O
up O
by O
the O
windlass O
continually O
keeps O
the O
whale O
rolling O
over O
and O
over O
in O
the O
water O
, O
and O
as O
the O
blubber O
in O
one O
strip O
uniformly O
peels O
off O
along O
the O
line O
called O
the O
" O
scarf O
, O
" O
simultaneously O
cut O
by O
the O
spades O
of O
Starbuck O
and O
Stubb O
, O
the O
mates O
; O
and O
just O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
is O
thus O
peeled O
off O
, O
and O
indeed O
by O
that O
very O
act O
itself O
, O
it O
is O
all O
the O
time O
being O
hoisted O
higher O
and O
higher O
aloft O
till O
its O
upper O
end O
grazes O
the O
main-top O
; O
the O
men O
at O
the O
windlass O
then O
cease O
heaving O
, O
and O
for O
a O
moment O
or O
two O
the O
prodigious O
blood-dripping O
mass O
sways O
to O
and O
fro O
as O
if O
let O
down O
from O
the O
sky O
, O
and O
every O
one O
present O
must O
take O
good O
heed O
to O
dodge O
it O
when O
it O
swings O
, O
else O
it O
may O
box O
his O
ears O
and O
pitch O
him O
headlong O
overboard O
. O
One O
of O
the O
attending O
harpooneers O
now O
advances O
with O
a O
long O
, O
keen O
weapon O
called O
a O
boarding-sword O
, O
and O
watching O
his O
chance O
he O
dexterously O
slices O
out O
a O
considerable O
hole O
in O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
swaying O
mass O
. O
Into O
this O
hole O
, O
the O
end O
of O
the O
second O
alternating O
great O
tackle O
is O
then O
hooked O
so O
as O
to O
retain O
a O
hold O
upon O
the O
blubber O
, O
in O
order O
to O
prepare O
for O
what O
follows O
. O
Whereupon O
, O
this O
accomplished O
swordsman O
, O
warning O
all O
hands O
to O
stand O
off O
, O
once O
more O
makes O
a O
scientific O
dash O
at O
the O
mass O
, O
and O
with O
a O
few O
sidelong O
, O
desperate O
, O
lunging O
slicings O
, O
severs O
it O
completely O
in O
twain O
; O
so O
that O
while O
the O
short O
lower O
part O
is O
still O
fast O
, O
the O
long O
upper O
strip O
, O
called O
a O
blanket-piece O
, O
swings O
clear O
, O
and O
is O
all O
ready O
for O
lowering O
. O
The O
heavers O
forward O
now O
resume O
their O
song O
, O
and O
while O
the O
one O
tackle O
is O
peeling O
and O
hoisting O
a O
second O
strip O
from O
the O
whale O
, O
the O
other O
is O
slowly O
slackened O
away O
, O
and O
down O
goes O
the O
first O
strip O
through O
the O
main O
hatchway O
right O
beneath O
, O
into O
an O
unfurnished O
parlor O
called O
the O
blubber-room O
. O
Into O
this O
twilight O
apartment O
sundry O
nimble O
hands O
keep O
coiling O
away O
the O
long O
blanket-piece O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
great O
live O
mass O
of O
plaited O
serpents O
. O
And O
thus O
the O
work O
proceeds O
; O
the O
two O
tackles O
hoisting O
and O
lowering O
simultaneously O
; O
both O
whale O
and O
windlass O
heaving O
, O
the O
heavers O
singing O
, O
the O
blubber-room O
gentlemen O
coiling O
, O
the O
mates O
scarfing O
, O
the O
ship O
straining O
, O
and O
all O
hands O
swearing O
occasionally O
, O
by O
way O
of O
assuaging O
the O
general O
friction O
. O
