over O
Him O
. O
It O
must O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
that O
all O
this O
time O
we O
have O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
prodigious O
head O
hanging O
to O
the O
Pequod O
's O
side O
. O
But O
we O
must O
let O
it O
continue O
hanging O
there O
a O
while O
till O
we O
can O
get O
a O
chance O
to O
attend O
to O
it O
. O
For O
the O
present O
other O
matters O
press O
, O
and O
the O
best O
we O
can O
do O
now O
for O
the O
head O
, O
is O
to O
pray O
heaven O
the O
tackles O
may O
hold O
. O
Now O
, O
during O
the O
past O
night O
and O
forenoon O
, O
the O
Pequod O
had O
gradually O
drifted O
into O
a O
sea O
, O
which O
, O
by O
its O
occasional O
patches O
of O
yellow O
brit O
, O
gave O
unusual O
tokens O
of O
the O
vicinity O
of O
Right O
Whales O
, O
a O
species O
of O
the O
Leviathan O
that O
but O
few O
supposed O
to O
be O
at O
this O
particular O
time O
lurking O
anywhere O
near O
. O
And O
though O
all O
hands O
commonly O
disdained O
the O
capture O
of O
those O
inferior O
creatures O
; O
and O
though O
the O
Pequod O
was O
not O
commissioned O
to O
cruise O
for O
them O
at O
all O
, O
and O
though O
she O
had O
passed O
numbers O
of O
them O
near O
the O
Crozetts O
without O
lowering O
a O
boat O
; O
yet O
now O
that O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
had O
been O
brought O
alongside O
and O
beheaded O
, O
to O
the O
surprise O
of O
all O
, O
the O
announcement O
was O
made O
that O
a O
Right O
Whale O
should O
be O
captured O
that O
day O
, O
if O
opportunity O
offered O
. O
Nor O
was O
this O
long O
wanting O
. O
Tall O
spouts O
were O
seen O
to O
leeward O
; O
and O
two O
boats O
, O
Stubb O
's O
and O
Flask O
's O
, O
were O
detached O
in O
pursuit O
. O
Pulling O
further O
and O
further O
away O
, O
they O
at O
last O
became O
almost O
invisible O
to O
the O
men O
at O
the O
mast-head O
. O
But O
suddenly O
in O
the O
distance O
, O
they O
saw O
a O
great O
heap O
of O
tumultuous O
white O
water O
, O
and O
soon O
after O
news O
came O
from O
aloft O
that O
one O
or O
both O
the O
boats O
must O
be O
fast O
. O
An O
interval O
passed O
and O
the O
boats O
were O
in O
plain O
sight O
, O
in O
the O
act O
of O
being O
dragged O
right O
towards O
the O
ship O
by O
the O
towing O
whale O
. O
So O
close O
did O
the O
monster O
come O
to O
the O
hull O
, O
that O
at O
first O
it O
seemed O
as O
if O
he O
meant O
it O
malice O
; O
but O
suddenly O
going O
down O
in O
a O
maelstrom O
, O
within O
three O
rods O
of O
the O
planks O
, O
he O
wholly O
disappeared O
from O
view O
, O
as O
if O
diving O
under O
the O
keel O
. O
" O
Cut O
, O
cut O
! O
" O
was O
the O
cry O
from O
the O
ship O
to O
the O
boats O
, O
which O
, O
for O
one O
instant O
, O
seemed O
on O
the O
point O
of O
being O
brought O
with O
a O
deadly O
dash O
against O
the O
vessel O
's O
side O
. O
But O
having O
plenty O
of O
line O
yet O
in O
the O
tubs O
, O
and O
the O
whale O
not O
sounding O
very O
rapidly O
, O
they O
paid O
out O
abundance O
of O
rope O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
pulled O
with O
all O
their O
might O
so O
as O
to O
get O
ahead O
of O
the O
ship O
. O
For O
a O
few O
minutes O
the O
struggle O
was O
intensely O
critical O
; O
for O
while O
they O
still O
slacked O
out O
the O
tightened O
line O
in O
one O
direction O
, O
and O
still O
plied O
their O
oars O
in O
another O
, O
the O
contending O
strain O
threatened O
to O
take O
them O
under O
. O
But O
it O
was O
only O
a O
few O
feet O
advance O
they O
sought O
to O
gain O
. O
And O
they O
stuck O
to O
it O
till O
they O
did O
gain O
it O
; O
when O
instantly O
, O
a O
swift O
tremor O
was O
felt O
running O
like O
lightning O
along O
the O
keel O
, O
as O
the O
strained O
line O
, O
scraping O
beneath O
the O
ship O
, O
suddenly O
rose O
to O
view O
under O
her O
bows O
, O
snapping O
and O
quivering O
; O
and O
so O
flinging O
off O
its O
drippings O
, O
that O
the O
drops O
fell O
like O
bits O
of O
broken O
glass O
on O
the O
water O
, O
while O
the O
whale O
beyond O
also O
rose O
to O
sight O
, O
and O
once O
more O
the O
boats O
were O
free O
to O
fly O
. O
But O
the O
fagged O
whale O
abated O
his O
speed O
, O
and O
blindly O
altering O
his O
course O
, O
went O
round O
the O
stern O
of O
the O
ship O
towing O
the O
two O
boats O
after O
him O
, O
so O
that O
they O
performed O
a O
complete O
circuit O
. O
Meantime O
, O
they O
hauled O
more O
and O
more O
upon O
their O
lines O
, O
till O
close O
flanking O
him O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
Stubb O
answered O
Flask O
with O
lance O
for O
lance O
; O
and O
thus O
round O
and O
round O
the O
Pequod O
the O
battle O
went O
, O
while O
the O
multitudes O
of O
sharks O
that O
had O
before O
swum O
round O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
body O
, O
rushed O
to O
the O
fresh O
blood O
that O
was O
spilled O
, O
thirstily O
drinking O
at O
every O
new O
gash O
, O
as O
the O
eager O
Israelites O
did O
at O
the O
new O
bursting O
fountains O
that O
poured O
from O
the O
smitten O
rock O
. O
At O
last O
his O
spout O
grew O
thick O
, O
and O
with O
a O
frightful O
roll O
and O
vomit O
, O
he O
turned O
upon O
his O
back O
a O
corpse O
. O
While O
the O
two O
headsmen O
were O
engaged O
in O
making O
fast O
cords O
to O
his O
flukes O
, O
and O
in O
other O
ways O
getting O
the O
mass O
in O
readiness O
for O
towing O
, O
some O
conversation O
ensued O
between O
them O
. O
" O
I O
wonder O
what O
the O
old O
man O
wants O
with O
this O
lump O
of O
foul O
lard O
, O
" O
said O
Stubb O
, O
not O
without O
some O
disgust O
at O
the O
thought O
of O
having O
to O
do O
with O
so O
ignoble O
a O
leviathan O
. O
" O
Wants O
with O
it O
? O
" O
said O
Flask O
, O
coiling O
some O
spare O
line O
in O
the O
boat O
's O
bow O
, O
" O
did O
you O
never O
hear O
that O
the O
ship O
which O
but O
once O
has O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
head O
hoisted O
on O
her O
starboard O
side O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
a O
Right O
Whale O
's O
on O
the O
larboard O
; O
did O
you O
never O
hear O
, O
Stubb O
, O
that O
that O
ship O
can O
never O
afterwards O
capsize O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
not O
? O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
but O
I O
heard O
that O
gamboge O
ghost O
of O
a O
Fedallah O
saying O
so O
, O
and O
he O
seems O
to O
know O
all O
about O
ships O
' O
charms O
. O
But O
I O
sometimes O
think O
he O
'll O
charm O
the O
ship O
to O
no O
good O
at O
last O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
half O
like O
that O
chap O
, O
Stubb O
. O
Did O
you O
ever O
notice O
how O
that O
tusk O
of O
his O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
carved O
into O
a O
snake O
's O
head O
, O
Stubb O
? O
" O
" O
Sink O
him O
! O
I O
never O
look O
at O
him O
at O
all O
; O
but O
if O
ever O
I O
get O
a O
chance O
of O
a O
dark O
night O
, O
and O
he O
standing O
hard O
by O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
no O
one O
by O
; O
look O
down O
there O
, O
Flask O
" O
—pointing O
into O
the O
sea O
with O
a O
peculiar O
motion O
of O
both O
hands— O
" O
Aye O
, O
will O
I O
! O
Flask O
, O
I O
take O
that O
Fedallah O
to O
be O
the O
devil O
in O
disguise O
. O
Do O
you O
believe O
that O
cock O
and O
bull O
story O
about O
his O
having O
been O
stowed O
away O
on O
board O
ship O
? O
He O
's O
the O
devil O
, O
I O
say O
. O
The O
reason O
why O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
his O
tail O
, O
is O
because O
he O
tucks O
it O
up O
out O
of O
sight O
; O
he O
carries O
it O
coiled O
away O
in O
his O
pocket O
, O
I O
guess O
. O
Blast O
him O
! O
now O
that O
I O
think O
of O
it O
, O
he O
's O
always O
wanting O
oakum O
to O
stuff O
into O
the O
toes O
of O
his O
boots O
. O
" O
" O
He O
sleeps O
in O
his O
boots O
, O
do O
n't O
he O
? O
He O
has O
n't O
got O
any O
hammock O
; O
but O
I O
've O
seen O
him O
lay O
of O
nights O
in O
a O
coil O
of O
rigging O
. O
" O
" O
No O
doubt O
, O
and O
it O
's O
because O
of O
his O
cursed O
tail O
; O
he O
coils O
it O
down O
, O
do O
ye O
see O
, O
in O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
rigging O
. O
" O
" O
What O
's O
the O
old O
man O
have O
so O
much O
to O
do O
with O
him O
for O
? O
" O
" O
Striking O
up O
a O
swap O
or O
a O
bargain O
, O
I O
suppose O
. O
" O
" O
Bargain O
? O
—about O
what O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
do O
ye O
see O
, O
the O
old O
man O
is O
hard O
bent O
after O
that O
White O
Whale O
, O
and O
the O
devil O
there O
is O
trying O
to O
come O
round O
him O
, O
and O
get O
him O
to O
swap O
away O
his O
silver O
watch O
, O
or O
his O
soul O
, O
or O
something O
of O
that O
sort O
, O
and O
then O
he O
'll O
surrender O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
" O
" O
Pooh O
! O
Stubb O
, O
you O
are O
skylarking O
; O
how O
can O
Fedallah O
do O
that O
? O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
, O
Flask O
, O
but O
the O
devil O
is O
a O
curious O
chap O
, O
and O
a O
wicked O
one O
, O
I O
tell O
ye O
. O
Why O
, O
they O
say O
as O
how O
he O
went O
a O
sauntering O
into O
the O
old O
flag-ship O
once O
, O
switching O
his O
tail O
about O
devilish O
easy O
and O
gentlemanlike O
, O
and O
inquiring O
if O
the O
old O
governor O
was O
at O
home O
. O
Well O
, O
he O
was O
at O
home O
, O
and O
asked O
the O
devil O
what O
he O
wanted O
. O
The O
devil O
, O
switching O
his O
hoofs O
, O
up O
and O
says O
, O
' O
I O
want O
John O
. O
' O
'What O
for O
? O
' O
says O
the O
old O
governor O
. O
'What O
business O
is O
that O
of O
yours O
, O
' O
says O
the O
devil O
, O
getting O
mad O
, O
— O
' O
I O
want O
to O
use O
him O
. O
' O
'Take O
him O
, O
' O
says O
the O
governor—and O
by O
the O
Lord O
, O
Flask O
, O
if O
the O
devil O
did O
n't O
give O
John O
the O
Asiatic O
cholera O
before O
he O
got O
through O
with O
him O
, O
I O
'll O
eat O
this O
whale O
in O
one O
mouthful O
. O
But O
look O
sharp—ai O
n't O
you O
all O
ready O
there O
? O
Well O
, O
then O
, O
pull O
ahead O
, O
and O
let O
's O
get O
the O
whale O
alongside O
. O
" O
" O
I O
think O
I O
remember O
some O
such O
story O
as O
you O
were O
telling O
, O
" O
said O
Flask O
, O
when O
at O
last O
the O
two O
boats O
were O
slowly O
advancing O
with O
their O
burden O
towards O
the O
ship O
, O
" O
but O
I O
ca O
n't O
remember O
where O
. O
" O
" O
Three O
Spaniards O
? O
Adventures O
of O
those O
three O
bloody-minded O
soldadoes O
? O
Did O
ye O
read O
it O
there O
, O
Flask O
? O
I O
guess O
ye O
did O
? O
" O
" O
No O
: O
never O
saw O
such O
a O
book O
; O
heard O
of O
it O
, O
though O
. O
But O
now O
, O
tell O
me O
, O
Stubb O
, O
do O
you O
suppose O
that O
that O
devil O
you O
was O
speaking O
of O
just O
now O
, O
was O
the O
same O
you O
say O
is O
now O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod O
? O
" O
" O
Am O
I O
the O
same O
man O
that O
helped O
kill O
this O
whale O
? O
Does O
n't O
the O
devil O
live O
for O
ever O
; O
who O
ever O
heard O
that O
the O
devil O
was O
dead O
? O
Did O
you O
ever O
see O
any O
parson O
a O
wearing O
mourning O
for O
the O
devil O
? O
And O
if O
the O
devil O
has O
a O
latch-key O
to O
get O
into O
the O
admiral O
's O
cabin O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
suppose O
he O
can O
crawl O
into O
a O
porthole O
? O
Tell O
me O
that O
, O
Mr O
. O
Flask O
? O
" O
" O
How O
old O
do O
you O
suppose O
Fedallah O
is O
, O
Stubb O
? O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
see O
that O
mainmast O
there O
? O
" O
pointing O
to O
the O
ship O
; O
" O
well O
, O
that O
's O
the O
figure O
one O
; O
now O
take O
all O
the O
hoops O
in O
the O
Pequod O
's O
hold O
, O
and O
string O
along O
in O
a O
row O
with O
that O
mast O
, O
for O
oughts O
, O
do O
you O
see O
; O
well O
, O
that O
would O
n't O
begin O
to O
be O
Fedallah O
's O
age O
. O
Nor O
all O
the O
coopers O
in O
creation O
could O
n't O
show O
hoops O
enough O
to O
make O
oughts O
enough O
. O
" O
" O
But O
see O
here O
, O
Stubb O
, O
I O
thought O
you O
a O
little O
boasted O
just O
now O
, O
that O
you O
meant O
to O
give O
Fedallah O
a O
sea-toss O
, O
if O
you O
got O
a O
good O
chance O
. O
Now O
, O
if O
he O
's O
so O
old O
as O
all O
those O
hoops O
of O
yours O
come O
to O
, O
and O
if O
he O
is O
going O
to O
live O
for O
ever O
, O
what O
good O
will O
it O
do O
to O
pitch O
him O
overboard—tell O
me O
that O
? O
" O
Give O
him O
a O
good O
ducking O
, O
anyhow O
. O
" O
" O
But O
he O
'd O
crawl O
back O
. O
" O
" O
Duck O
him O
again O
; O
and O
keep O
ducking O
him O
. O
" O
" O
Suppose O
he O
should O
take O
it O
into O
his O
head O
to O
duck O
you O
, O
though—yes O
, O
and O
drown O
you—what O
then O
? O
" O
" O
I O
should O
like O
to O
see O
him O
try O
it O
; O
I O
'd O
give O
him O
such O
a O
pair O
of O
black O
eyes O
that O
he O
would O
n't O
dare O
to O
show O
his O
face O
in O
the O
admiral O
's O
cabin O
again O
for O
a O
long O
while O
, O
let O
alone O
down O
in O
the O
orlop O
there O
, O
where O
he O
lives O
, O
and O
hereabouts O
on O
the O
upper O
decks O
where O
he O
sneaks O
so O
much O
. O
Damn O
the O
devil O
, O
Flask O
; O
so O
you O
suppose O
I O
'm O
afraid O
of O
the O
devil O
? O
Who O
's O
afraid O
of O
him O
, O
except O
the O
old O
governor O
who O
dares O
n't O
catch O
him O
and O
put O
him O
in O
double-darbies O
, O
as O
he O
deserves O
, O
but O
lets O
him O
go O
about O
kidnapping O
people O
; O
aye O
, O
and O
signed O
a O
bond O
with O
him O
, O
that O
all O
the O
people O
the O
devil O
kidnapped O
, O
he O
'd O
roast O
for O
him O
? O
There O
's O
a O
governor O
! O
" O
" O
Do O
you O
suppose O
Fedallah O
wants O
to O
kidnap O
Captain O
Ahab O
? O
" O
" O
Do O
I O
suppose O
it O
? O
You O
'll O
know O
it O
before O
long O
, O
Flask O
. O
But O
I O
am O
going O
now O
to O
keep O
a O
sharp O
look-out O
on O
him O
; O
and O
if O
I O
see O
anything O
very O
suspicious O
going O
on O
, O
I O
'll O
just O
take O
him O
by O
the O
nape O
of O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
say—Look O
here O
, O
Beelzebub O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
; O
and O
if O
he O
makes O
any O
fuss O
, O
by O
the O
Lord O
I O
'll O
make O
a O
grab O
into O
his O
pocket O
for O
his O
tail O
, O
take O
it O
to O
the O
capstan O
, O
and O
give O
him O
such O
a O
wrenching O
and O
heaving O
, O
that O
his O
tail O
will O
come O
short O
off O
at O
the O
stump—do O
you O
see O
; O
and O
then O
, O
I O
rather O
guess O
when O
he O
finds O
himself O
docked O
in O
that O
queer O
fashion O
, O
he O
'll O
sneak O
off O
without O
the O
poor O
satisfaction O
of O
feeling O
his O
tail O
between O
his O
legs O
. O
" O
" O
And O
what O
will O
you O
do O
with O
the O
tail O
, O
Stubb O
? O
" O
" O
Do O
with O
it O
? O
Sell O
it O
for O
an O
ox O
whip O
when O
we O
get O
home O
; O
—what O
else O
? O
" O
" O
Now O
, O
do O
you O
mean O
what O
you O
say O
, O
and O
have O
been O
saying O
all O
along O
, O
Stubb O
? O
" O
" O
Mean O
or O
not O
mean O
, O
here O
we O
are O
at O
the O
ship O
. O
" O
The O
boats O
were O
here O
hailed O
, O
to O
tow O
the O
whale O
on O
the O
larboard O
side O
, O
where O
fluke O
chains O
and O
other O
necessaries O
were O
already O
prepared O
for O
securing O
him O
. O
" O
Did O
n't O
I O
tell O
you O
so O
? O
" O
said O
Flask O
; O
" O
yes O
, O
you O
'll O
soon O
see O
this O
right O
whale O
's O
head O
hoisted O
up O
opposite O
that O
parmacetti O
's O
. O
" O
In O
good O
time O
, O
Flask O
's O
saying O
proved O
true O
. O
As O
before O
, O
the O
Pequod O
steeply O
leaned O
over O
towards O
the O
sperm O
whale O
's O
head O
, O
now O
, O
by O
the O
counterpoise O
of O
both O
heads O
, O
she O
regained O
her O
even O
keel O
; O
though O
sorely O
strained O
, O
you O
may O
well O
believe O
. O
So O
, O
when O
on O
one O
side O
you O
hoist O
in O
Locke O
's O
head O
, O
you O
go O
over O
that O
way O
; O
but O
now O
, O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
hoist O
in O
Kant O
's O
and O
you O
come O
back O
again O
; O
but O
in O
very O
poor O
plight O
. O
Thus O
, O
some O
minds O
for O
ever O
keep O
trimming O
boat O
. O
Oh O
, O
ye O
foolish O
! O
throw O
all O
these O
thunder-heads O
overboard O
, O
and O
then O
you O
will O
float O
light O
and O
right O
. O
In O
disposing O
of O
the O
body O
of O
a O
right O
whale O
, O
when O
brought O
alongside O
the O
ship O
, O
the O
same O
preliminary O
proceedings O
commonly O
take O
place O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
sperm O
whale O
; O
only O
, O
in O
the O
latter O
instance O
, O
the O
head O
is O
cut O
off O
whole O
, O
but O
in O
the O
former O
the O
lips O
and O
tongue O
are O
separately O
removed O
and O
hoisted O
on O
deck O
, O
with O
all O
the O
well O
known O
black O
bone O
attached O
to O
what O
is O
called O
the O
crown-piece O
. O
But O
nothing O
like O
this O
, O
in O
the O
present O
case O
, O
had O
been O
done O
. O
The O
carcases O
of O
both O
whales O
had O
dropped O
astern O
; O
and O
the O
head-laden O
ship O
not O
a O
little O
resembled O
a O
mule O
carrying O
a O
pair O
of O
overburdening O
panniers O
. O
Meantime O
, O
Fedallah O
was O
calmly O
eyeing O
the O
right O
whale O
's O
head O
, O
and O
ever O
and O
anon O
glancing O
from O
the O
deep O
wrinkles O
there O
to O
the O
lines O
in O
his O
own O
hand O
. O
And O
Ahab O
chanced O
so O
to O
stand O
, O
that O
the O
Parsee O
occupied O
his O
shadow O
; O
while O
, O
if O
the O
Parsee O
's O
shadow O
was O
there O
at O
all O
it O
seemed O
only O
to O
blend O
with O
, O
and O
lengthen O
Ahab O
's O
. O
As O
the O
crew O
toiled O
on O
, O
Laplandish O
speculations O
were O
bandied O
among O
them O
, O
concerning O
all O
these O
passing O
things O
. O
