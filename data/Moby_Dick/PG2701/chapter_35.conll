It O
was O
during O
the O
more O
pleasant O
weather O
, O
that O
in O
due O
rotation O
with O
the O
other O
seamen O
my O
first O
mast-head O
came O
round O
. O
In O
most O
American O
whalemen O
the O
mast-heads O
are O
manned O
almost O
simultaneously O
with O
the O
vessel O
's O
leaving O
her O
port O
; O
even O
though O
she O
may O
have O
fifteen O
thousand O
miles O
, O
and O
more O
, O
to O
sail O
ere O
reaching O
her O
proper O
cruising O
ground O
. O
And O
if O
, O
after O
a O
three O
, O
four O
, O
or O
five O
years O
' O
voyage O
she O
is O
drawing O
nigh O
home O
with O
anything O
empty O
in O
her—say O
, O
an O
empty O
vial O
even—then O
, O
her O
mast-heads O
are O
kept O
manned O
to O
the O
last O
; O
and O
not O
till O
her O
skysail-poles O
sail O
in O
among O
the O
spires O
of O
the O
port O
, O
does O
she O
altogether O
relinquish O
the O
hope O
of O
capturing O
one O
whale O
more O
. O
Now O
, O
as O
the O
business O
of O
standing O
mast-heads O
, O
ashore O
or O
afloat O
, O
is O
a O
very O
ancient O
and O
interesting O
one O
, O
let O
us O
in O
some O
measure O
expatiate O
here O
. O
I O
take O
it O
, O
that O
the O
earliest O
standers O
of O
mast-heads O
were O
the O
old O
Egyptians O
; O
because O
, O
in O
all O
my O
researches O
, O
I O
find O
none O
prior O
to O
them O
. O
For O
though O
their O
progenitors O
, O
the O
builders O
of O
Babel O
, O
must O
doubtless O
, O
by O
their O
tower O
, O
have O
intended O
to O
rear O
the O
loftiest O
mast-head O
in O
all O
Asia O
, O
or O
Africa O
either O
; O
yet O
( O
ere O
the O
final O
truck O
was O
put O
to O
it O
) O
as O
that O
great O
stone O
mast O
of O
theirs O
may O
be O
said O
to O
have O
gone O
by O
the O
board O
, O
in O
the O
dread O
gale O
of O
God O
's O
wrath O
; O
therefore O
, O
we O
can O
not O
give O
these O
Babel O
builders O
priority O
over O
the O
Egyptians O
. O
And O
that O
the O
Egyptians O
were O
a O
nation O
of O
mast-head O
standers O
, O
is O
an O
assertion O
based O
upon O
the O
general O
belief O
among O
archæologists O
, O
that O
the O
first O
pyramids O
were O
founded O
for O
astronomical O
purposes O
: O
a O
theory O
singularly O
supported O
by O
the O
peculiar O
stair-like O
formation O
of O
all O
four O
sides O
of O
those O
edifices O
; O
whereby O
, O
with O
prodigious O
long O
upliftings O
of O
their O
legs O
, O
those O
old O
astronomers O
were O
wont O
to O
mount O
to O
the O
apex O
, O
and O
sing O
out O
for O
new O
stars O
; O
even O
as O
the O
look-outs O
of O
a O
modern O
ship O
sing O
out O
for O
a O
sail O
, O
or O
a O
whale O
just O
bearing O
in O
sight O
. O
In O
Saint O
Stylites O
, O
the O
famous O
Christian O
hermit O
of O
old O
times O
, O
who O
built O
him O
a O
lofty O
stone O
pillar O
in O
the O
desert O
and O
spent O
the O
whole O
latter O
portion O
of O
his O
life O
on O
its O
summit O
, O
hoisting O
his O
food O
from O
the O
ground O
with O
a O
tackle O
; O
in O
him O
we O
have O
a O
remarkable O
instance O
of O
a O
dauntless O
stander-of-mast-heads O
; O
who O
was O
not O
to O
be O
driven O
from O
his O
place O
by O
fogs O
or O
frosts O
, O
rain O
, O
hail O
, O
or O
sleet O
; O
but O
valiantly O
facing O
everything O
out O
to O
the O
last O
, O
literally O
died O
at O
his O
post O
. O
Of O
modern O
standers-of-mast-heads O
we O
have O
but O
a O
lifeless O
set O
; O
mere O
stone O
, O
iron O
, O
and O
bronze O
men O
; O
who O
, O
though O
well O
capable O
of O
facing O
out O
a O
stiff O
gale O
, O
are O
still O
entirely O
incompetent O
to O
the O
business O
of O
singing O
out O
upon O
discovering O
any O
strange O
sight O
. O
There O
is O
Napoleon O
; O
who O
, O
upon O
the O
top O
of O
the O
column O
of O
Vendome O
, O
stands O
with O
arms O
folded O
, O
some O
one O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
feet O
in O
the O
air O
; O
careless O
, O
now O
, O
who O
rules O
the O
decks O
below O
; O
whether O
Louis O
Philippe O
, O
Louis O
Blanc O
, O
or O
Louis O
the O
Devil O
. O
Great O
Washington O
, O
too O
, O
stands O
high O
aloft O
on O
his O
towering O
main-mast O
in O
Baltimore O
, O
and O
like O
one O
of O
Hercules O
' O
pillars O
, O
his O
column O
marks O
that O
point O
of O
human O
grandeur O
beyond O
which O
few O
mortals O
will O
go O
. O
Admiral O
Nelson O
, O
also O
, O
on O
a O
capstan O
of O
gun-metal O
, O
stands O
his O
mast-head O
in O
Trafalgar O
Square O
; O
and O
ever O
when O
most O
obscured O
by O
that O
London O
smoke O
, O
token O
is O
yet O
given O
that O
a O
hidden O
hero O
is O
there O
; O
for O
where O
there O
is O
smoke O
, O
must O
be O
fire O
. O
But O
neither O
great O
Washington O
, O
nor O
Napoleon O
, O
nor O
Nelson O
, O
will O
answer O
a O
single O
hail O
from O
below O
, O
however O
madly O
invoked O
to O
befriend O
by O
their O
counsels O
the O
distracted O
decks O
upon O
which O
they O
gaze O
; O
however O
it O
may O
be O
surmised O
, O
that O
their O
spirits O
penetrate O
through O
the O
thick O
haze O
of O
the O
future O
, O
and O
descry O
what O
shoals O
and O
what O
rocks O
must O
be O
shunned O
. O
It O
may O
seem O
unwarrantable O
to O
couple O
in O
any O
respect O
the O
mast-head O
standers O
of O
the O
land O
with O
those O
of O
the O
sea O
; O
but O
that O
in O
truth O
it O
is O
not O
so O
, O
is O
plainly O
evinced O
by O
an O
item O
for O
which O
Obed O
Macy O
, O
the O
sole O
historian O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
stands O
accountable O
. O
The O
worthy O
Obed O
tells O
us O
, O
that O
in O
the O
early O
times O
of O
the O
whale O
fishery O
, O
ere O
ships O
were O
regularly O
launched O
in O
pursuit O
of O
the O
game O
, O
the O
people O
of O
that O
island O
erected O
lofty O
spars O
along O
the O
sea-coast O
, O
to O
which O
the O
look-outs O
ascended O
by O
means O
of O
nailed O
cleats O
, O
something O
as O
fowls O
go O
upstairs O
in O
a O
hen-house O
. O
A O
few O
years O
ago O
this O
same O
plan O
was O
adopted O
by O
the O
Bay O
whalemen O
of O
New O
Zealand O
, O
who O
, O
upon O
descrying O
the O
game O
, O
gave O
notice O
to O
the O
ready-manned O
boats O
nigh O
the O
beach O
. O
But O
this O
custom O
has O
now O
become O
obsolete O
; O
turn O
we O
then O
to O
the O
one O
proper O
mast-head O
, O
that O
of O
a O
whale-ship O
at O
sea O
. O
The O
three O
mast-heads O
are O
kept O
manned O
from O
sun-rise O
to O
sun-set O
; O
the O
seamen O
taking O
their O
regular O
turns O
( O
as O
at O
the O
helm O
) O
, O
and O
relieving O
each O
other O
every O
two O
hours O
. O
In O
the O
serene O
weather O
of O
the O
tropics O
it O
is O
exceedingly O
pleasant O
the O
mast-head O
; O
nay O
, O
to O
a O
dreamy O
meditative O
man O
it O
is O
delightful O
. O
There O
you O
stand O
, O
a O
hundred O
feet O
above O
the O
silent O
decks O
, O
striding O
along O
the O
deep O
, O
as O
if O
the O
masts O
were O
gigantic O
stilts O
, O
while O
beneath O
you O
and O
between O
your O
legs O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
swim O
the O
hugest O
monsters O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
even O
as O
ships O
once O
sailed O
between O
the O
boots O
of O
the O
famous O
Colossus O
at O
old O
Rhodes O
. O
There O
you O
stand O
, O
lost O
in O
the O
infinite O
series O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
with O
nothing O
ruffled O
but O
the O
waves O
. O
The O
tranced O
ship O
indolently O
rolls O
; O
the O
drowsy O
trade O
winds O
blow O
; O
everything O
resolves O
you O
into O
languor O
. O
For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
in O
this O
tropic O
whaling O
life O
, O
a O
sublime O
uneventfulness O
invests O
you O
; O
you O
hear O
no O
news O
; O
read O
no O
gazettes O
; O
extras O
with O
startling O
accounts O
of O
commonplaces O
never O
delude O
you O
into O
unnecessary O
excitements O
; O
you O
hear O
of O
no O
domestic O
afflictions O
; O
bankrupt O
securities O
; O
fall O
of O
stocks O
; O
are O
never O
troubled O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
what O
you O
shall O
have O
for O
dinner—for O
all O
your O
meals O
for O
three O
years O
and O
more O
are O
snugly O
stowed O
in O
casks O
, O
and O
your O
bill O
of O
fare O
is O
immutable O
. O
In O
one O
of O
those O
southern O
whalesmen O
, O
on O
a O
long O
three O
or O
four O
years O
' O
voyage O
, O
as O
often O
happens O
, O
the O
sum O
of O
the O
various O
hours O
you O
spend O
at O
the O
mast-head O
would O
amount O
to O
several O
entire O
months O
. O
And O
it O
is O
much O
to O
be O
deplored O
that O
the O
place O
to O
which O
you O
devote O
so O
considerable O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
whole O
term O
of O
your O
natural O
life O
, O
should O
be O
so O
sadly O
destitute O
of O
anything O
approaching O
to O
a O
cosy O
inhabitiveness O
, O
or O
adapted O
to O
breed O
a O
comfortable O
localness O
of O
feeling O
, O
such O
as O
pertains O
to O
a O
bed O
, O
a O
hammock O
, O
a O
hearse O
, O
a O
sentry O
box O
, O
a O
pulpit O
, O
a O
coach O
, O
or O
any O
other O
of O
those O
small O
and O
snug O
contrivances O
in O
which O
men O
temporarily O
isolate O
themselves O
. O
Your O
most O
usual O
point O
of O
perch O
is O
the O
head O
of O
the O
t O
' O
gallant-mast O
, O
where O
you O
stand O
upon O
two O
thin O
parallel O
sticks O
( O
almost O
peculiar O
to O
whalemen O
) O
called O
the O
t O
' O
gallant O
cross-trees O
. O
Here O
, O
tossed O
about O
by O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
beginner O
feels O
about O
as O
cosy O
as O
he O
would O
standing O
on O
a O
bull O
's O
horns O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
, O
in O
cold O
weather O
you O
may O
carry O
your O
house O
aloft O
with O
you O
, O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
watch-coat O
; O
but O
properly O
speaking O
the O
thickest O
watch-coat O
is O
no O
more O
of O
a O
house O
than O
the O
unclad O
body O
; O
for O
as O
the O
soul O
is O
glued O
inside O
of O
its O
fleshy O
tabernacle O
, O
and O
can O
not O
freely O
move O
about O
in O
it O
, O
nor O
even O
move O
out O
of O
it O
, O
without O
running O
great O
risk O
of O
perishing O
( O
like O
an O
ignorant O
pilgrim O
crossing O
the O
snowy O
Alps O
in O
winter O
) O
; O
so O
a O
watch-coat O
is O
not O
so O
much O
of O
a O
house O
as O
it O
is O
a O
mere O
envelope O
, O
or O
additional O
skin O
encasing O
you O
. O
You O
can O
not O
put O
a O
shelf O
or O
chest O
of O
drawers O
in O
your O
body O
, O
and O
no O
more O
can O
you O
make O
a O
convenient O
closet O
of O
your O
watch-coat O
. O
Concerning O
all O
this O
, O
it O
is O
much O
to O
be O
deplored O
that O
the O
mast-heads O
of O
a O
southern O
whale O
ship O
are O
unprovided O
with O
those O
enviable O
little O
tents O
or O
pulpits O
, O
called O
_crow's-nests_ O
, O
in O
which O
the O
look-outs O
of O
a O
Greenland O
whaler O
are O
protected O
from O
the O
inclement O
weather O
of O
the O
frozen O
seas O
. O
In O
the O
fireside O
narrative O
of O
Captain O
Sleet O
, O
entitled O
" O
A O
Voyage O
among O
the O
Icebergs O
, O
in O
quest O
of O
the O
Greenland O
Whale O
, O
and O
incidentally O
for O
the O
re-discovery O
of O
the O
Lost O
Icelandic O
Colonies O
of O
Old O
Greenland O
; O
" O
in O
this O
admirable O
volume O
, O
all O
standers O
of O
mast-heads O
are O
furnished O
with O
a O
charmingly O
circumstantial O
account O
of O
the O
then O
recently O
invented O
_crow's-nest_ O
of O
the O
Glacier O
, O
which O
was O
the O
name O
of O
Captain O
Sleet O
's O
good O
craft O
. O
He O
called O
it O
the O
_Sleet O
's O
crow's-nest_ O
, O
in O
honor O
of O
himself O
; O
he O
being O
the O
original O
inventor O
and O
patentee O
, O
and O
free O
from O
all O
ridiculous O
false O
delicacy O
, O
and O
holding O
that O
if O
we O
call O
our O
own O
children O
after O
our O
own O
names O
( O
we O
fathers O
being O
the O
original O
inventors O
and O
patentees O
) O
, O
so O
likewise O
should O
we O
denominate O
after O
ourselves O
any O
other O
apparatus O
we O
may O
beget O
. O
In O
shape O
, O
the O
Sleet O
's O
crow's-nest O
is O
something O
like O
a O
large O
tierce O
or O
pipe O
; O
it O
is O
open O
above O
, O
however O
, O
where O
it O
is O
furnished O
with O
a O
movable O
side-screen O
to O
keep O
to O
windward O
of O
your O
head O
in O
a O
hard O
gale O
. O
Being O
fixed O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
mast O
, O
you O
ascend O
into O
it O
through O
a O
little O
trap-hatch O
in O
the O
bottom O
. O
On O
the O
after O
side O
, O
or O
side O
next O
the O
stern O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
is O
a O
comfortable O
seat O
, O
with O
a O
locker O
underneath O
for O
umbrellas O
, O
comforters O
, O
and O
coats O
. O
In O
front O
is O
a O
leather O
rack O
, O
in O
which O
to O
keep O
your O
speaking O
trumpet O
, O
pipe O
, O
telescope O
, O
and O
other O
nautical O
conveniences O
. O
When O
Captain O
Sleet O
in O
person O
stood O
his O
mast-head O
in O
this O
crow's-nest O
of O
his O
, O
he O
tells O
us O
that O
he O
always O
had O
a O
rifle O
with O
him O
( O
also O
fixed O
in O
the O
rack O
) O
, O
together O
with O
a O
powder O
flask O
and O
shot O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
popping O
off O
the O
stray O
narwhales O
, O
or O
vagrant O
sea O
unicorns O
infesting O
those O
waters O
; O
for O
you O
can O
not O
successfully O
shoot O
at O
them O
from O
the O
deck O
owing O
to O
the O
resistance O
of O
the O
water O
, O
but O
to O
shoot O
down O
upon O
them O
is O
a O
very O
different O
thing O
. O
Now O
, O
it O
was O
plainly O
a O
labor O
of O
love O
for O
Captain O
Sleet O
to O
describe O
, O
as O
he O
does O
, O
all O
the O
little O
detailed O
conveniences O
of O
his O
crow's-nest O
; O
but O
though O
he O
so O
enlarges O
upon O
many O
of O
these O
, O
and O
though O
he O
treats O
us O
to O
a O
very O
scientific O
account O
of O
his O
experiments O
in O
this O
crow's-nest O
, O
with O
a O
small O
compass O
he O
kept O
there O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
counteracting O
the O
errors O
resulting O
from O
what O
is O
called O
the O
" O
local O
attraction O
" O
of O
all O
binnacle O
magnets O
; O
an O
error O
ascribable O
to O
the O
horizontal O
vicinity O
of O
the O
iron O
in O
the O
ship O
's O
planks O
, O
and O
in O
the O
Glacier O
's O
case O
, O
perhaps O
, O
to O
there O
having O
been O
so O
many O
broken-down O
blacksmiths O
among O
her O
crew O
; O
I O
say O
, O
that O
though O
the O
Captain O
is O
very O
discreet O
and O
scientific O
here O
, O
yet O
, O
for O
all O
his O
learned O
" O
binnacle O
deviations O
, O
" O
" O
azimuth O
compass O
observations O
, O
" O
and O
" O
approximate O
errors O
, O
" O
he O
knows O
very O
well O
, O
Captain O
Sleet O
, O
that O
he O
was O
not O
so O
much O
immersed O
in O
those O
profound O
magnetic O
meditations O
, O
as O
to O
fail O
being O
attracted O
occasionally O
towards O
that O
well O
replenished O
little O
case-bottle O
, O
so O
nicely O
tucked O
in O
on O
one O
side O
of O
his O
crow O
's O
nest O
, O
within O
easy O
reach O
of O
his O
hand O
. O
Though O
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
I O
greatly O
admire O
and O
even O
love O
the O
brave O
, O
the O
honest O
, O
and O
learned O
Captain O
; O
yet O
I O
take O
it O
very O
ill O
of O
him O
that O
he O
should O
so O
utterly O
ignore O
that O
case-bottle O
, O
seeing O
what O
a O
faithful O
friend O
and O
comforter O
it O
must O
have O
been O
, O
while O
with O
mittened O
fingers O
and O
hooded O
head O
he O
was O
studying O
the O
mathematics O
aloft O
there O
in O
that O
bird O
's O
nest O
within O
three O
or O
four O
perches O
of O
the O
pole O
. O
But O
if O
we O
Southern O
whale-fishers O
are O
not O
so O
snugly O
housed O
aloft O
as O
Captain O
Sleet O
and O
his O
Greenlandmen O
were O
; O
yet O
that O
disadvantage O
is O
greatly O
counter-balanced O
by O
the O
widely O
contrasting O
serenity O
of O
those O
seductive O
seas O
in O
which O
we O
South O
fishers O
mostly O
float O
. O
For O
one O
, O
I O
used O
to O
lounge O
up O
the O
rigging O
very O
leisurely O
, O
resting O
in O
the O
top O
to O
have O
a O
chat O
with O
Queequeg O
, O
or O
any O
one O
else O
off O
duty O
whom O
I O
might O
find O
there O
; O
then O
ascending O
a O
little O
way O
further O
, O
and O
throwing O
a O
lazy O
leg O
over O
the O
top-sail O
yard O
, O
take O
a O
preliminary O
view O
of O
the O
watery O
pastures O
, O
and O
so O
at O
last O
mount O
to O
my O
ultimate O
destination O
. O
Let O
me O
make O
a O
clean O
breast O
of O
it O
here O
, O
and O
frankly O
admit O
that O
I O
kept O
but O
sorry O
guard O
. O
With O
the O
problem O
of O
the O
universe O
revolving O
in O
me O
, O
how O
could O
I—being O
left O
completely O
to O
myself O
at O
such O
a O
thought-engendering O
altitude—how O
could O
I O
but O
lightly O
hold O
my O
obligations O
to O
observe O
all O
whale-ships O
' O
standing O
orders O
, O
" O
Keep O
your O
weather O
eye O
open O
, O
and O
sing O
out O
every O
time O
. O
" O
And O
let O
me O
in O
this O
place O
movingly O
admonish O
you O
, O
ye O
ship-owners O
of O
Nantucket O
! O
Beware O
of O
enlisting O
in O
your O
vigilant O
fisheries O
any O
lad O
with O
lean O
brow O
and O
hollow O
eye O
; O
given O
to O
unseasonable O
meditativeness O
; O
and O
who O
offers O
to O
ship O
with O
the O
Phædon O
instead O
of O
Bowditch O
in O
his O
head O
. O
Beware O
of O
such O
an O
one O
, O
I O
say O
; O
your O
whales O
must O
be O
seen O
before O
they O
can O
be O
killed O
; O
and O
this O
sunken-eyed O
young O
Platonist O
will O
tow O
you O
ten O
wakes O
round O
the O
world O
, O
and O
never O
make O
you O
one O
pint O
of O
sperm O
the O
richer O
. O
Nor O
are O
these O
monitions O
at O
all O
unneeded O
. O
For O
nowadays O
, O
the O
whale-fishery O
furnishes O
an O
asylum O
for O
many O
romantic O
, O
melancholy O
, O
and O
absent-minded O
young O
men O
, O
disgusted O
with O
the O
carking O
cares O
of O
earth O
, O
and O
seeking O
sentiment O
in O
tar O
and O
blubber O
. O
Childe O
Harold O
not O
unfrequently O
perches O
himself O
upon O
the O
mast-head O
of O
some O
luckless O
disappointed O
whale-ship O
, O
and O
in O
moody O
phrase O
ejaculates O
: O
— O
" O
Roll O
on O
, O
thou O
deep O
and O
dark O
blue O
ocean O
, O
roll O
! O
Ten O
thousand O
blubber-hunters O
sweep O
over O
thee O
in O
vain O
. O
" O
Very O
often O
do O
the O
captains O
of O
such O
ships O
take O
those O
absent-minded O
young O
philosophers O
to O
task O
, O
upbraiding O
them O
with O
not O
feeling O
sufficient O
" O
interest O
" O
in O
the O
voyage O
; O
half-hinting O
that O
they O
are O
so O
hopelessly O
lost O
to O
all O
honorable O
ambition O
, O
as O
that O
in O
their O
secret O
souls O
they O
would O
rather O
not O
see O
whales O
than O
otherwise O
. O
But O
all O
in O
vain O
; O
those O
young O
Platonists O
have O
a O
notion O
that O
their O
vision O
is O
imperfect O
; O
they O
are O
short-sighted O
; O
what O
use O
, O
then O
, O
to O
strain O
the O
visual O
nerve O
? O
They O
have O
left O
their O
opera-glasses O
at O
home O
. O
" O
Why O
, O
thou O
monkey O
, O
" O
said O
a O
harpooneer O
to O
one O
of O
these O
lads O
, O
" O
we O
've O
been O
cruising O
now O
hard O
upon O
three O
years O
, O
and O
thou O
hast O
not O
raised O
a O
whale O
yet O
. O
Whales O
are O
scarce O
as O
hen O
's O
teeth O
whenever O
thou O
art O
up O
here O
. O
" O
Perhaps O
they O
were O
; O
or O
perhaps O
there O
might O
have O
been O
shoals O
of O
them O
in O
the O
far O
horizon O
; O
but O
lulled O
into O
such O
an O
opium-like O
listlessness O
of O
vacant O
, O
unconscious O
reverie O
is O
this O
absent-minded O
youth O
by O
the O
blending O
cadence O
of O
waves O
with O
thoughts O
, O
that O
at O
last O
he O
loses O
his O
identity O
; O
takes O
the O
mystic O
ocean O
at O
his O
feet O
for O
the O
visible O
image O
of O
that O
deep O
, O
blue O
, O
bottomless O
soul O
, O
pervading O
mankind O
and O
nature O
; O
and O
every O
strange O
, O
half-seen O
, O
gliding O
, O
beautiful O
thing O
that O
eludes O
him O
; O
every O
dimly-discovered O
, O
uprising O
fin O
of O
some O
undiscernible O
form O
, O
seems O
to O
him O
the O
embodiment O
of O
those O
elusive O
thoughts O
that O
only O
people O
the O
soul O
by O
continually O
flitting O
through O
it O
. O
In O
this O
enchanted O
mood O
, O
thy O
spirit O
ebbs O
away O
to O
whence O
it O
came O
; O
becomes O
diffused O
through O
time O
and O
space O
; O
like O
Cranmer O
's O
sprinkled O
Pantheistic O
ashes O
, O
forming O
at O
last O
a O
part O
of O
every O
shore O
the O
round O
globe O
over O
. O
There O
is O
no O
life O
in O
thee O
, O
now O
, O
except O
that O
rocking O
life O
imparted O
by O
a O
gently O
rolling O
ship O
; O
by O
her O
, O
borrowed O
from O
the O
sea O
; O
by O
the O
sea O
, O
from O
the O
inscrutable O
tides O
of O
God O
. O
But O
while O
this O
sleep O
, O
this O
dream O
is O
on O
ye O
, O
move O
your O
foot O
or O
hand O
an O
inch O
; O
slip O
your O
hold O
at O
all O
; O
and O
your O
identity O
comes O
back O
in O
horror O
. O
Over O
Descartian O
vortices O
you O
hover O
. O
And O
perhaps O
, O
at O
mid-day O
, O
in O
the O
fairest O
weather O
, O
with O
one O
half-throttled O
shriek O
you O
drop O
through O
that O
transparent O
air O
into O
the O
summer O
sea O
, O
no O
more O
to O
rise O
for O
ever O
. O
Heed O
it O
well O
, O
ye O
Pantheists O
! O
