It O
was O
quite O
late O
in O
the O
evening O
when O
the O
little O
Moss O
came O
snugly O
to O
anchor O
, O
and O
Queequeg O
and O
I O
went O
ashore O
; O
so O
we O
could O
attend O
to O
no O
business O
that O
day O
, O
at O
least O
none O
but O
a O
supper O
and O
a O
bed O
. O
The O
landlord O
of O
the O
Spouter-Inn O
had O
recommended O
us O
to O
his O
cousin O
Hosea O
Hussey O
of O
the O
Try O
Pots O
, O
whom O
he O
asserted O
to O
be O
the O
proprietor O
of O
one O
of O
the O
best O
kept O
hotels O
in O
all O
Nantucket O
, O
and O
moreover O
he O
had O
assured O
us O
that O
Cousin O
Hosea O
, O
as O
he O
called O
him O
, O
was O
famous O
for O
his O
chowders O
. O
In O
short O
, O
he O
plainly O
hinted O
that O
we O
could O
not O
possibly O
do O
better O
than O
try O
pot-luck O
at O
the O
Try O
Pots O
. O
But O
the O
directions O
he O
had O
given O
us O
about O
keeping O
a O
yellow O
warehouse O
on O
our O
starboard O
hand O
till O
we O
opened O
a O
white O
church O
to O
the O
larboard O
, O
and O
then O
keeping O
that O
on O
the O
larboard O
hand O
till O
we O
made O
a O
corner O
three O
points O
to O
the O
starboard O
, O
and O
that O
done O
, O
then O
ask O
the O
first O
man O
we O
met O
where O
the O
place O
was O
: O
these O
crooked O
directions O
of O
his O
very O
much O
puzzled O
us O
at O
first O
, O
especially O
as O
, O
at O
the O
outset O
, O
Queequeg O
insisted O
that O
the O
yellow O
warehouse—our O
first O
point O
of O
departure—must O
be O
left O
on O
the O
larboard O
hand O
, O
whereas O
I O
had O
understood O
Peter O
Coffin O
to O
say O
it O
was O
on O
the O
starboard O
. O
However O
, O
by O
dint O
of O
beating O
about O
a O
little O
in O
the O
dark O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
knocking O
up O
a O
peaceable O
inhabitant O
to O
inquire O
the O
way O
, O
we O
at O
last O
came O
to O
something O
which O
there O
was O
no O
mistaking O
. O
Two O
enormous O
wooden O
pots O
painted O
black O
, O
and O
suspended O
by O
asses O
' O
ears O
, O
swung O
from O
the O
cross-trees O
of O
an O
old O
top-mast O
, O
planted O
in O
front O
of O
an O
old O
doorway O
. O
The O
horns O
of O
the O
cross-trees O
were O
sawed O
off O
on O
the O
other O
side O
, O
so O
that O
this O
old O
top-mast O
looked O
not O
a O
little O
like O
a O
gallows O
. O
Perhaps O
I O
was O
over O
sensitive O
to O
such O
impressions O
at O
the O
time O
, O
but O
I O
could O
not O
help O
staring O
at O
this O
gallows O
with O
a O
vague O
misgiving O
. O
A O
sort O
of O
crick O
was O
in O
my O
neck O
as O
I O
gazed O
up O
to O
the O
two O
remaining O
horns O
; O
yes O
, O
_two_ O
of O
them O
, O
one O
for O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
one O
for O
me O
. O
It O
's O
ominous O
, O
thinks O
I O
. O
A O
Coffin O
my O
Innkeeper O
upon O
landing O
in O
my O
first O
whaling O
port O
; O
tombstones O
staring O
at O
me O
in O
the O
whalemen O
's O
chapel O
; O
and O
here O
a O
gallows O
! O
and O
a O
pair O
of O
prodigious O
black O
pots O
too O
! O
Are O
these O
last O
throwing O
out O
oblique O
hints O
touching O
Tophet O
? O
I O
was O
called O
from O
these O
reflections O
by O
the O
sight O
of O
a O
freckled O
woman O
with O
yellow O
hair O
and O
a O
yellow O
gown O
, O
standing O
in O
the O
porch O
of O
the O
inn O
, O
under O
a O
dull O
red O
lamp O
swinging O
there O
, O
that O
looked O
much O
like O
an O
injured O
eye O
, O
and O
carrying O
on O
a O
brisk O
scolding O
with O
a O
man O
in O
a O
purple O
woollen O
shirt O
. O
" O
Get O
along O
with O
ye O
, O
" O
said O
she O
to O
the O
man O
, O
" O
or O
I O
'll O
be O
combing O
ye O
! O
" O
" O
Come O
on O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
all O
right O
. O
There O
's O
Mrs O
. O
Hussey O
. O
" O
And O
so O
it O
turned O
out O
; O
Mr. O
Hosea O
Hussey O
being O
from O
home O
, O
but O
leaving O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
entirely O
competent O
to O
attend O
to O
all O
his O
affairs O
. O
Upon O
making O
known O
our O
desires O
for O
a O
supper O
and O
a O
bed O
, O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
, O
postponing O
further O
scolding O
for O
the O
present O
, O
ushered O
us O
into O
a O
little O
room O
, O
and O
seating O
us O
at O
a O
table O
spread O
with O
the O
relics O
of O
a O
recently O
concluded O
repast O
, O
turned O
round O
to O
us O
and O
said— O
" O
Clam O
or O
Cod O
? O
" O
" O
What O
's O
that O
about O
Cods O
, O
ma'am O
? O
" O
said O
I O
, O
with O
much O
politeness O
. O
" O
Clam O
or O
Cod O
? O
" O
she O
repeated O
. O
" O
A O
clam O
for O
supper O
? O
a O
cold O
clam O
; O
is O
_that_ O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
Mrs O
. O
Hussey O
? O
" O
says O
I O
, O
" O
but O
that O
's O
a O
rather O
cold O
and O
clammy O
reception O
in O
the O
winter O
time O
, O
ai O
n't O
it O
, O
Mrs O
. O
Hussey O
? O
" O
But O
being O
in O
a O
great O
hurry O
to O
resume O
scolding O
the O
man O
in O
the O
purple O
Shirt O
, O
who O
was O
waiting O
for O
it O
in O
the O
entry O
, O
and O
seeming O
to O
hear O
nothing O
but O
the O
word O
" O
clam O
, O
" O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
hurried O
towards O
an O
open O
door O
leading O
to O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
bawling O
out O
" O
clam O
for O
two O
, O
" O
disappeared O
. O
" O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
do O
you O
think O
that O
we O
can O
make O
out O
a O
supper O
for O
us O
both O
on O
one O
clam O
? O
" O
However O
, O
a O
warm O
savory O
steam O
from O
the O
kitchen O
served O
to O
belie O
the O
apparently O
cheerless O
prospect O
before O
us O
. O
But O
when O
that O
smoking O
chowder O
came O
in O
, O
the O
mystery O
was O
delightfully O
explained O
. O
Oh O
, O
sweet O
friends O
! O
hearken O
to O
me O
. O
It O
was O
made O
of O
small O
juicy O
clams O
, O
scarcely O
bigger O
than O
hazel O
nuts O
, O
mixed O
with O
pounded O
ship O
biscuit O
, O
and O
salted O
pork O
cut O
up O
into O
little O
flakes O
; O
the O
whole O
enriched O
with O
butter O
, O
and O
plentifully O
seasoned O
with O
pepper O
and O
salt O
. O
Our O
appetites O
being O
sharpened O
by O
the O
frosty O
voyage O
, O
and O
in O
particular O
, O
Queequeg O
seeing O
his O
favourite O
fishing O
food O
before O
him O
, O
and O
the O
chowder O
being O
surpassingly O
excellent O
, O
we O
despatched O
it O
with O
great O
expedition O
: O
when O
leaning O
back O
a O
moment O
and O
bethinking O
me O
of O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
's O
clam O
and O
cod O
announcement O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
try O
a O
little O
experiment O
. O
Stepping O
to O
the O
kitchen O
door O
, O
I O
uttered O
the O
word O
" O
cod O
" O
with O
great O
emphasis O
, O
and O
resumed O
my O
seat O
. O
In O
a O
few O
moments O
the O
savoury O
steam O
came O
forth O
again O
, O
but O
with O
a O
different O
flavor O
, O
and O
in O
good O
time O
a O
fine O
cod-chowder O
was O
placed O
before O
us O
. O
We O
resumed O
business O
; O
and O
while O
plying O
our O
spoons O
in O
the O
bowl O
, O
thinks O
I O
to O
myself O
, O
I O
wonder O
now O
if O
this O
here O
has O
any O
effect O
on O
the O
head O
? O
What O
's O
that O
stultifying O
saying O
about O
chowder-headed O
people O
? O
" O
But O
look O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
ai O
n't O
that O
a O
live O
eel O
in O
your O
bowl O
? O
Where O
's O
your O
harpoon O
? O
" O
Fishiest O
of O
all O
fishy O
places O
was O
the O
Try O
Pots O
, O
which O
well O
deserved O
its O
name O
; O
for O
the O
pots O
there O
were O
always O
boiling O
chowders O
. O
Chowder O
for O
breakfast O
, O
and O
chowder O
for O
dinner O
, O
and O
chowder O
for O
supper O
, O
till O
you O
began O
to O
look O
for O
fish-bones O
coming O
through O
your O
clothes O
. O
The O
area O
before O
the O
house O
was O
paved O
with O
clam-shells O
. O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
wore O
a O
polished O
necklace O
of O
codfish O
vertebra O
; O
and O
Hosea O
Hussey O
had O
his O
account O
books O
bound O
in O
superior O
old O
shark-skin O
. O
There O
was O
a O
fishy O
flavor O
to O
the O
milk O
, O
too O
, O
which O
I O
could O
not O
at O
all O
account O
for O
, O
till O
one O
morning O
happening O
to O
take O
a O
stroll O
along O
the O
beach O
among O
some O
fishermen O
's O
boats O
, O
I O
saw O
Hosea O
's O
brindled O
cow O
feeding O
on O
fish O
remnants O
, O
and O
marching O
along O
the O
sand O
with O
each O
foot O
in O
a O
cod O
's O
decapitated O
head O
, O
looking O
very O
slip-shod O
, O
I O
assure O
ye O
. O
Supper O
concluded O
, O
we O
received O
a O
lamp O
, O
and O
directions O
from O
Mrs. O
Hussey O
concerning O
the O
nearest O
way O
to O
bed O
; O
but O
, O
as O
Queequeg O
was O
about O
to O
precede O
me O
up O
the O
stairs O
, O
the O
lady O
reached O
forth O
her O
arm O
, O
and O
demanded O
his O
harpoon O
; O
she O
allowed O
no O
harpoon O
in O
her O
chambers O
. O
" O
Why O
not O
? O
" O
said O
I O
; O
" O
every O
true O
whaleman O
sleeps O
with O
his O
harpoon—but O
why O
not O
? O
" O
" O
Because O
it O
's O
dangerous O
, O
" O
says O
she O
. O
" O
Ever O
since O
young O
Stiggs O
coming O
from O
that O
unfort'nt O
v O
' O
y'ge O
of O
his O
, O
when O
he O
was O
gone O
four O
years O
and O
a O
half O
, O
with O
only O
three O
barrels O
of O
_ile_ O
, O
was O
found O
dead O
in O
my O
first O
floor O
back O
, O
with O
his O
harpoon O
in O
his O
side O
; O
ever O
since O
then O
I O
allow O
no O
boarders O
to O
take O
sich O
dangerous O
weepons O
in O
their O
rooms O
at O
night O
. O
So O
, O
Mr. O
Queequeg O
" O
( O
for O
she O
had O
learned O
his O
name O
) O
, O
" O
I O
will O
just O
take O
this O
here O
iron O
, O
and O
keep O
it O
for O
you O
till O
morning O
. O
But O

Both O

variety O
