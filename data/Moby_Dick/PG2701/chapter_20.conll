A O
day O
or O
two O
passed O
, O
and O
there O
was O
great O
activity O
aboard O
the O
Pequod O
. O
Not O
only O
were O
the O
old O
sails O
being O
mended O
, O
but O
new O
sails O
were O
coming O
on O
board O
, O
and O
bolts O
of O
canvas O
, O
and O
coils O
of O
rigging O
; O
in O
short O
, O
everything O
betokened O
that O
the O
ship O
's O
preparations O
were O
hurrying O
to O
a O
close O
. O
Captain O
Peleg O
seldom O
or O
never O
went O
ashore O
, O
but O
sat O
in O
his O
wigwam O
keeping O
a O
sharp O
look-out O
upon O
the O
hands O
: O
Bildad O
did O
all O
the O
purchasing O
and O
providing O
at O
the O
stores O
; O
and O
the O
men O
employed O
in O
the O
hold O
and O
on O
the O
rigging O
were O
working O
till O
long O
after O
night-fall O
. O
On O
the O
day O
following O
Queequeg O
's O
signing O
the O
articles O
, O
word O
was O
given O
at O
all O
the O
inns O
where O
the O
ship O
's O
company O
were O
stopping O
, O
that O
their O
chests O
must O
be O
on O
board O
before O
night O
, O
for O
there O
was O
no O
telling O
how O
soon O
the O
vessel O
might O
be O
sailing O
. O
So O
Queequeg O
and O
I O
got O
down O
our O
traps O
, O
resolving O
, O
however O
, O
to O
sleep O
ashore O
till O
the O
last O
. O
But O
it O
seems O
they O
always O
give O
very O
long O
notice O
in O
these O
cases O
, O
and O
the O
ship O
did O
not O
sail O
for O
several O
days O
. O
But O
no O
wonder O
; O
there O
was O
a O
good O
deal O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
how O
many O
things O
to O
be O
thought O
of O
, O
before O
the O
Pequod O
was O
fully O
equipped O
. O
Every O
one O
knows O
what O
a O
multitude O
of O
things—beds O
, O
sauce-pans O
, O
knives O
and O
forks O
, O
shovels O
and O
tongs O
, O
napkins O
, O
nut-crackers O
, O
and O
what O
not O
, O
are O
indispensable O
to O
the O
business O
of O
housekeeping O
. O
Just O
so O
with O
whaling O
, O
which O
necessitates O
a O
three-years O
' O
housekeeping O
upon O
the O
wide O
ocean O
, O
far O
from O
all O
grocers O
, O
costermongers O
, O
doctors O
, O
bakers O
, O
and O
bankers O
. O
And O
though O
this O
also O
holds O
true O
of O
merchant O
vessels O
, O
yet O
not O
by O
any O
means O
to O
the O
same O
extent O
as O
with O
whalemen O
. O
For O
besides O
the O
great O
length O
of O
the O
whaling O
voyage O
, O
the O
numerous O
articles O
peculiar O
to O
the O
prosecution O
of O
the O
fishery O
, O
and O
the O
impossibility O
of O
replacing O
them O
at O
the O
remote O
harbors O
usually O
frequented O
, O
it O
must O
be O
remembered O
, O
that O
of O
all O
ships O
, O
whaling O
vessels O
are O
the O
most O
exposed O
to O
accidents O
of O
all O
kinds O
, O
and O
especially O
to O
the O
destruction O
and O
loss O
of O
the O
very O
things O
upon O
which O
the O
success O
of O
the O
voyage O
most O
depends O
. O
Hence O
, O
the O
spare O
boats O
, O
spare O
spars O
, O
and O
spare O
lines O
and O
harpoons O
, O
and O
spare O
everythings O
, O
almost O
, O
but O
a O
spare O
Captain O
and O
duplicate O
ship O
. O
At O
the O
period O
of O
our O
arrival O
at O
the O
Island O
, O
the O
heaviest O
storage O
of O
the O
Pequod O
had O
been O
almost O
completed O
; O
comprising O
her O
beef O
, O
bread O
, O
water O
, O
fuel O
, O
and O
iron O
hoops O
and O
staves O
. O
But O
, O
as O
before O
hinted O
, O
for O
some O
time O
there O
was O
a O
continual O
fetching O
and O
carrying O
on O
board O
of O
divers O
odds O
and O
ends O
of O
things O
, O
both O
large O
and O
small O
. O
Chief O
among O
those O
who O
did O
this O
fetching O
and O
carrying O
was O
Captain O
Bildad O
's O
sister O
, O
a O
lean O
old O
lady O
of O
a O
most O
determined O
and O
indefatigable O
spirit O
, O
but O
withal O
very O
kindhearted O
, O
who O
seemed O
resolved O
that O
, O
if O
_she_ O
could O
help O
it O
, O
nothing O
should O
be O
found O
wanting O
in O
the O
Pequod O
, O
after O
once O
fairly O
getting O
to O
sea O
. O
At O
one O
time O
she O
would O
come O
on O
board O
with O
a O
jar O
of O
pickles O
for O
the O
steward O
's O
pantry O
; O
another O
time O
with O
a O
bunch O
of O
quills O
for O
the O
chief O
mate O
's O
desk O
, O
where O
he O
kept O
his O
log O
; O
a O
third O
time O
with O
a O
roll O
of O
flannel O
for O
the O
small O
of O
some O
one O
's O
rheumatic O
back O
. O
Never O
did O
any O
woman O
better O
deserve O
her O
name O
, O
which O
was O
Charity—Aunt O
Charity O
, O
as O
everybody O
called O
her O
. O
And O
like O
a O
sister O
of O
charity O
did O
this O
charitable O
Aunt O
Charity O
bustle O
about O
hither O
and O
thither O
, O
ready O
to O
turn O
her O
hand O
and O
heart O
to O
anything O
that O
promised O
to O
yield O
safety O
, O
comfort O
, O
and O
consolation O
to O
all O
on O
board O
a O
ship O
in O
which O
her O
beloved O
brother O
Bildad O
was O
concerned O
, O
and O
in O
which O
she O
herself O
owned O
a O
score O
or O
two O
of O
well-saved O
dollars O
. O
But O
it O
was O
startling O
to O
see O
this O
excellent O
hearted O
Quakeress O
coming O
on O
board O
, O
as O
she O
did O
the O
last O
day O
, O
with O
a O
long O
oil-ladle O
in O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
a O
still O
longer O
whaling O
lance O
in O
the O
other O
. O
Nor O
was O
Bildad O
himself O
nor O
Captain O
Peleg O
at O
all O
backward O
. O
As O
for O
Bildad O
, O
he O
carried O
about O
with O
him O
a O
long O
list O
of O
the O
articles O
needed O
, O
and O
at O
every O
fresh O
arrival O
, O
down O
went O
his O
mark O
opposite O
that O
article O
upon O
the O
paper O
. O
Every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
Peleg O
came O
hobbling O
out O
of O
his O
whalebone O
den O
, O
roaring O
at O
the O
men O
down O
the O
hatchways O
, O
roaring O
up O
to O
the O
riggers O
at O
the O
mast-head O
, O
and O
then O
concluded O
by O
roaring O
back O
into O
his O
wigwam O
. O
During O
these O
days O
of O
preparation O
, O
Queequeg O
and O
I O
often O
visited O
the O
craft O
, O
and O
as O
often O
I O
asked O
about O
Captain O
Ahab O
, O
and O
how O
he O
was O
, O
and O
when O
he O
was O
going O
to O
come O
on O
board O
his O
ship O
. O
To O
these O
questions O
they O
would O
answer O
, O
that O
he O
was O
getting O
better O
and O
better O
, O
and O
was O
expected O
aboard O
every O
day O
; O
meantime O
, O
the O
two O
captains O
, O
Peleg O
and O
Bildad O
, O
could O
attend O
to O
everything O
necessary O
to O
fit O
the O
vessel O
for O
the O
voyage O
. O
If O
I O
had O
been O
downright O
honest O
with O
myself O
, O
I O
would O
have O
seen O
very O
plainly O
in O
my O
heart O
that O
I O
did O
but O
half O
fancy O
being O
committed O
this O
way O
to O
so O
long O
a O
voyage O
, O
without O
once O
laying O
my O
eyes O
on O
the O
man O
who O
was O
to O
be O
the O
absolute O
dictator O
of O
it O
, O
so O
soon O
as O
the O
ship O
sailed O
out O
upon O
the O
open O
sea O
. O
But O
when O
a O
man O
suspects O
any O
wrong O
, O
it O
sometimes O
happens O
that O
if O
he O
be O
already O
involved O
in O
the O
matter O
, O
he O
insensibly O
strives O
to O
cover O
up O
his O
suspicions O
even O
from O
himself O
. O
And O
much O
this O
way O
it O
was O
with O
me O
. O
I O
said O
nothing O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
think O
nothing O
. O
At O
last O
it O
was O
given O
out O
that O
some O
time O
next O
day O
the O
ship O
would O
certainly O
sail O
. O
So O
next O
morning O
, O
Queequeg O
and O
I O
took O
a O
very O
early O
start O
. O
