The O
previous O
chapter O
gave O
account O
of O
an O
immense O
body O
or O
herd O
of O
Sperm O
Whales O
, O
and O
there O
was O
also O
then O
given O
the O
probable O
cause O
inducing O
those O
vast O
aggregations O
. O
Now O
, O
though O
such O
great O
bodies O
are O
at O
times O
encountered O
, O
yet O
, O
as O
must O
have O
been O
seen O
, O
even O
at O
the O
present O
day O
, O
small O
detached O
bands O
are O
occasionally O
observed O
, O
embracing O
from O
twenty O
to O
fifty O
individuals O
each O
. O
Such O
bands O
are O
known O
as O
schools O
. O
They O
generally O
are O
of O
two O
sorts O
; O
those O
composed O
almost O
entirely O
of O
females O
, O
and O
those O
mustering O
none O
but O
young O
vigorous O
males O
, O
or O
bulls O
as O
they O
are O
familiarly O
designated O
. O
In O
cavalier O
attendance O
upon O
the O
school O
of O
females O
, O
you O
invariably O
see O
a O
male O
of O
full O
grown O
magnitude O
, O
but O
not O
old O
; O
who O
, O
upon O
any O
alarm O
, O
evinces O
his O
gallantry O
by O
falling O
in O
the O
rear O
and O
covering O
the O
flight O
of O
his O
ladies O
. O
In O
truth O
, O
this O
gentleman O
is O
a O
luxurious O
Ottoman O
, O
swimming O
about O
over O
the O
watery O
world O
, O
surroundingly O
accompanied O
by O
all O
the O
solaces O
and O
endearments O
of O
the O
harem O
. O
The O
contrast O
between O
this O
Ottoman O
and O
his O
concubines O
is O
striking O
; O
because O
, O
while O
he O
is O
always O
of O
the O
largest O
leviathanic O
proportions O
, O
the O
ladies O
, O
even O
at O
full O
growth O
, O
are O
not O
more O
than O
one-third O
of O
the O
bulk O
of O
an O
average-sized O
male O
. O
They O
are O
comparatively O
delicate O
, O
indeed O
; O
I O
dare O
say O
, O
not O
to O
exceed O
half O
a O
dozen O
yards O
round O
the O
waist O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
it O
can O
not O
be O
denied O
, O
that O
upon O
the O
whole O
they O
are O
hereditarily O
entitled O
to O
en O
bon O
point O
. O
It O
is O
very O
curious O
to O
watch O
this O
harem O
and O
its O
lord O
in O
their O
indolent O
ramblings O
. O
Like O
fashionables O
, O
they O
are O
for O
ever O
on O
the O
move O
in O
leisurely O
search O
of O
variety O
. O
You O
meet O
them O
on O
the O
Line O
in O
time O
for O
the O
full O
flower O
of O
the O
Equatorial O
feeding O
season O
, O
having O
just O
returned O
, O
perhaps O
, O
from O
spending O
the O
summer O
in O
the O
Northern O
seas O
, O
and O
so O
cheating O
summer O
of O
all O
unpleasant O
weariness O
and O
warmth O
. O
By O
the O
time O
they O
have O
lounged O
up O
and O
down O
the O
promenade O
of O
the O
Equator O
awhile O
, O
they O
start O
for O
the O
Oriental O
waters O
in O
anticipation O
of O
the O
cool O
season O
there O
, O
and O
so O
evade O
the O
other O
excessive O
temperature O
of O
the O
year O
. O
When O
serenely O
advancing O
on O
one O
of O
these O
journeys O
, O
if O
any O
strange O
suspicious O
sights O
are O
seen O
, O
my O
lord O
whale O
keeps O
a O
wary O
eye O
on O
his O
interesting O
family O
. O
Should O
any O
unwarrantably O
pert O
young O
Leviathan O
coming O
that O
way O
, O
presume O
to O
draw O
confidentially O
close O
to O
one O
of O
the O
ladies O
, O
with O
what O
prodigious O
fury O
the O
Bashaw O
assails O
him O
, O
and O
chases O
him O
away O
! O
High O
times O
, O
indeed O
, O
if O
unprincipled O
young O
rakes O
like O
him O
are O
to O
be O
permitted O
to O
invade O
the O
sanctity O
of O
domestic O
bliss O
; O
though O
do O
what O
the O
Bashaw O
will O
, O
he O
can O
not O
keep O
the O
most O
notorious O
Lothario O
out O
of O
his O
bed O
; O
for O
alas O
! O
all O
fish O
bed O
in O
common O
. O
As O
ashore O
, O
the O
ladies O
often O
cause O
the O
most O
terrible O
duels O
among O
their O
rival O
admirers O
; O
just O
so O
with O
the O
whales O
, O
who O
sometimes O
come O
to O
deadly O
battle O
, O
and O
all O
for O
love O
. O
They O
fence O
with O
their O
long O
lower O
jaws O
, O
sometimes O
locking O
them O
together O
, O
and O
so O
striving O
for O
the O
supremacy O
like O
elks O
that O
warringly O
interweave O
their O
antlers O
. O
Not O
a O
few O
are O
captured O
having O
the O
deep O
scars O
of O
these O
encounters O
, O
— O
furrowed O
heads O
, O
broken O
teeth O
, O
scolloped O
fins O
; O
and O
in O
some O
instances O
, O
wrenched O
and O
dislocated O
mouths O
. O
But O
supposing O
the O
invader O
of O
domestic O
bliss O
to O
betake O
himself O
away O
at O
the O
first O
rush O
of O
the O
harem O
's O
lord O
, O
then O
is O
it O
very O
diverting O
to O
watch O
that O
lord O
. O
Gently O
he O
insinuates O
his O
vast O
bulk O
among O
them O
again O
and O
revels O
there O
awhile O
, O
still O
in O
tantalizing O
vicinity O
to O
young O
Lothario O
, O
like O
pious O
Solomon O
devoutly O
worshipping O
among O
his O
thousand O
concubines O
. O
Granting O
other O
whales O
to O
be O
in O
sight O
, O
the O
fisherman O
will O
seldom O
give O
chase O
to O
one O
of O
these O
Grand O
Turks O
; O
for O
these O
Grand O
Turks O
are O
too O
lavish O
of O
their O
strength O
, O
and O
hence O
their O
unctuousness O
is O
small O
. O
As O
for O
the O
sons O
and O
the O
daughters O
they O
beget O
, O
why O
, O
those O
sons O
and O
daughters O
must O
take O
care O
of O
themselves O
; O
at O
least O
, O
with O
only O
the O
maternal O
help O
. O
For O
like O
certain O
other O
omnivorous O
roving O
lovers O
that O
might O
be O
named O
, O
my O
Lord O
Whale O
has O
no O
taste O
for O
the O
nursery O
, O
however O
much O
for O
the O
bower O
; O
and O
so O
, O
being O
a O
great O
traveller O
, O
he O
leaves O
his O
anonymous O
babies O
all O
over O
the O
world O
; O
every O
baby O
an O
exotic O
. O
In O
good O
time O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
as O
the O
ardor O
of O
youth O
declines O
; O
as O
years O
and O
dumps O
increase O
; O
as O
reflection O
lends O
her O
solemn O
pauses O
; O
in O
short O
, O
as O
a O
general O
lassitude O
overtakes O
the O
sated O
Turk O
; O
then O
a O
love O
of O
ease O
and O
virtue O
supplants O
the O
love O
for O
maidens O
; O
our O
Ottoman O
enters O
upon O
the O
impotent O
, O
repentant O
, O
admonitory O
stage O
of O
life O
, O
forswears O
, O
disbands O
the O
harem O
, O
and O
grown O
to O
an O
exemplary O
, O
sulky O
old O
soul O
, O
goes O
about O
all O
alone O
among O
the O
meridians O
and O
parallels O
saying O
his O
prayers O
, O
and O
warning O
each O
young O
Leviathan O
from O
his O
amorous O
errors O
. O
Now O
, O
as O
the O
harem O
of O
whales O
is O
called O
by O
the O
fishermen O
a O
school O
, O
so O
is O
the O
lord O
and O
master O
of O
that O
school O
technically O
known O
as O
the O
schoolmaster O
. O
It O
is O
therefore O
not O
in O
strict O
character O
, O
however O
admirably O
satirical O
, O
that O
after O
going O
to O
school O
himself O
, O
he O
should O
then O
go O
abroad O
inculcating O
not O
what O
he O
learned O
there O
, O
but O
the O
folly O
of O
it O
. O
His O
title O
, O
schoolmaster O
, O
would O
very O
naturally O
seem O
derived O
from O
the O
name O
bestowed O
upon O
the O
harem O
itself O
, O
but O
some O
have O
surmised O
that O
the O
man O
who O
first O
thus O
entitled O
this O
sort O
of O
Ottoman O
whale O
, O
must O
have O
read O
the O
memoirs O
of O
Vidocq O
, O
and O
informed O
himself O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
country-schoolmaster O
that O
famous O
Frenchman O
was O
in O
his O
younger O
days O
, O
and O
what O
was O
the O
nature O
of O
those O
occult O
lessons O
he O
inculcated O
into O
some O
of O
his O
pupils O
. O
The O
same O
secludedness O
and O
isolation O
to O
which O
the O
schoolmaster O
whale O
betakes O
himself O
in O
his O
advancing O
years O
, O
is O
true O
of O
all O
aged O
Sperm O
Whales O
. O
Almost O
universally O
, O
a O
lone O
whale— O
as O
a O
solitary O
Leviathan O
is O
called—proves O
an O
ancient O
one O
. O
Like O
venerable O
moss-bearded O
Daniel O
Boone O
, O
he O
will O
have O
no O
one O
near O
him O
but O
Nature O
herself O
; O
and O
her O
he O
takes O
to O
wife O
in O
the O
wilderness O
of O
waters O
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
wives O
she O
is O
, O
though O
she O
keeps O
so O
many O
moody O
secrets O
. O
The O
schools O
composing O
none O
but O
young O
and O
vigorous O
males O
, O
previously O
mentioned O
, O
offer O
a O
strong O
contrast O
to O
the O
harem O
schools O
. O
For O
while O
those O
female O
whales O
are O
characteristically O
timid O
, O
the O
young O
males O
, O
or O
forty-barrel-bulls O
, O
as O
they O
call O
them O
, O
are O
by O
far O
the O
most O
pugnacious O
of O
all O
Leviathans O
, O
and O
proverbially O
the O
most O
dangerous O
to O
encounter O
; O
excepting O
those O
wondrous O
grey-headed O
, O
grizzled O
whales O
, O
sometimes O
met O
, O
and O
these O
will O
fight O
you O
like O
grim O
fiends O
exasperated O
by O
a O
penal O
gout O
. O
The O
Forty-barrel-bull O
schools O
are O
larger O
than O
the O
harem O
schools O
. O
Like O
a O
mob O
of O
young O
collegians O
, O
they O
are O
full O
of O
fight O
, O
fun O
, O
and O
wickedness O
, O
tumbling O
round O
the O
world O
at O
such O
a O
reckless O
, O
rollicking O
rate O
, O
that O
no O
prudent O
underwriter O
would O
insure O
them O
any O
more O
than O
he O
would O
a O
riotous O
lad O
at O
Yale O
or O
Harvard O
. O
They O
soon O
relinquish O
this O
turbulence O
though O
, O
and O
when O
about O
three-fourths O
grown O
, O
break O
up O
, O
and O
separately O
go O
about O
in O
quest O
of O
settlements O
, O
that O
is O
, O
harems O
. O
Another O
point O
of O
difference O
between O
the O
male O
and O
female O
schools O
is O
still O
more O
characteristic O
of O
the O
sexes O
. O
Say O
you O
strike O
a O
Forty-barrel-bull—poor O
devil O
! O
all O
his O
comrades O
quit O
him O
. O
But O
strike O
a O
member O
of O
the O
harem O
school O
, O
and O
her O
companions O
swim O
around O
her O
with O
every O
token O
of O
concern O
, O
sometimes O
lingering O
so O
near O
her O
and O
so O
long O
, O
as O
themselves O
to O
fall O
a O
prey O
. O
