. O
Latin O
from O
the O
books O
of O
the O
Laws O
of O
England O
, O
which O
taken O
along O
with O
the O
context O
, O
means O
, O
that O
of O
all O
whales O
captured O
by O
anybody O
on O
the O
coast O
of O
that O
land O
, O
the O
King O
, O
as O
Honorary O
Grand O
Harpooneer O
, O
must O
have O
the O
head O
, O
and O
the O
Queen O
be O
respectfully O
presented O
with O
the O
tail O
. O
A O
division O
which O
, O
in O
the O
whale O
, O
is O
much O
like O
halving O
an O
apple O
; O
there O
is O
no O
intermediate O
remainder O
. O
Now O
as O
this O
law O
, O
under O
a O
modified O
form O
, O
is O
to O
this O
day O
in O
force O
in O
England O
; O
and O
as O
it O
offers O
in O
various O
respects O
a O
strange O
anomaly O
touching O
the O
general O
law O
of O
Fast—and O
Loose-Fish O
, O
it O
is O
here O
treated O
of O
in O
a O
separate O
chapter O
, O
on O
the O
same O
courteous O
principle O
that O
prompts O
the O
English O
railways O
to O
be O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
a O
separate O
car O
, O
specially O
reserved O
for O
the O
accommodation O
of O
royalty O
. O
In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
in O
curious O
proof O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
above-mentioned O
law O
is O
still O
in O
force O
, O
I O
proceed O
to O
lay O
before O
you O
a O
circumstance-that O
happened O
within O
the O
last O
two O
years O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
some O
honest O
mariners O
of O
Dover O
, O
or O
Sandwich O
, O
or O
some O
one O
of O
the O
Cinque O
Ports O
, O
had O
after O
a O
hard O
chase O
succeeded O
in O
killing O
and O
beaching O
a O
fine O
whale O
which O
they O
had O
originally O
descried O
afar O
off O
from O
the O
shore O
. O
Now O
the O
Cinque O
Ports O
are O
partially O
or O
somehow O
under O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
a O
sort O
of O
policeman O
or O
beadle O
, O
called O
a O
Lord O
Warden O
. O
Holding O
the O
office O
directly O
from O
the O
crown O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
all O
the O
royal O
emoluments O
incident O
to O
the O
Cinque O
Port O
territories O
become O
by O
assignment O
his O
. O
By O
some O
writers O
this O
office O
is O
called O
a O
sinecure O
. O
But O
not O
so O
. O
Because O
the O
Lord O
Warden O
is O
busily O
employed O
at O
times O
in O
fobbing O
his O
perquisites O
; O
which O
are O
his O
chiefly O
by O
virtue O
of O
that O
same O
fobbing O
of O
them O
. O
Now O
when O
these O
poor O
sun-burnt O
mariners O
, O
bare-footed O
, O
and O
with O
their O
trowsers O
rolled O
high O
up O
on O
their O
eely O
legs O
, O
had O
wearily O
hauled O
their O
fat O
fish O
high O
and O
dry O
, O
promising O
themselves O
a O
good O
150 O
pounds O
from O
the O
precious O
oil O
and O
bone O
; O
and O
in O
fantasy O
sipping O
rare O
tea O
with O
their O
wives O
, O
and O
good O
ale O
with O
their O
cronies O
, O
upon O
the O
strength O
of O
their O
respective O
shares O
; O
up O
steps O
a O
very O
learned O
and O
most O
Christian O
and O
charitable O
gentleman O
, O
with O
a O
copy O
of O
Blackstone O
under O
his O
arm O
; O
and O
laying O
it O
upon O
the O
whale O
's O
head O
, O
he O
says— O
" O
Hands O
off O
! O
this O
fish O
, O
my O
masters O
, O
is O
a O
Fast-Fish O
. O
I O
seize O
it O
as O
the O
Lord O
Warden O
's O
. O
" O
Upon O
this O
the O
poor O
mariners O
in O
their O
respectful O
consternation—so O
truly O
English— O
knowing O
not O
what O
to O
say O
, O
fall O
to O
vigorously O
scratching O
their O
heads O
all O
round O
; O
meanwhile O
ruefully O
glancing O
from O
the O
whale O
to O
the O
stranger O
. O
But O
that O
did O
in O
nowise O
mend O
the O
matter O
, O
or O
at O
all O
soften O
the O
hard O
heart O
of O
the O
learned O
gentleman O
with O
the O
copy O
of O
Blackstone O
. O
At O
length O
one O
of O
them O
, O
after O
long O
scratching O
about O
for O
his O
ideas O
, O
made O
bold O
to O
speak O
, O
" O
Please O
, O
sir O
, O
who O
is O
the O
Lord O
Warden O
? O
" O
" O
The O
Duke O
. O
" O
" O
But O
the O
duke O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
taking O
this O
fish O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
his O
. O
" O
" O
We O
have O
been O
at O
great O
trouble O
, O
and O
peril O
, O
and O
some O
expense O
, O
and O
is O
all O
that O
to O
go O
to O
the O
Duke O
's O
benefit O
; O
we O
getting O
nothing O
at O
all O
for O
our O
pains O
but O
our O
blisters O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
his O
. O
" O
" O
Is O
the O
Duke O
so O
very O
poor O
as O
to O
be O
forced O
to O
this O
desperate O
mode O
of O
getting O
a O
livelihood O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
his O
. O
" O
" O
I O
thought O
to O
relieve O
my O
old O
bed-ridden O
mother O
by O
part O
of O
my O
share O
of O
this O
whale O
. O
" O
" O
It O
is O
his O
. O
" O
" O
Wo O
n't O
the O
Duke O
be O
content O
with O
a O
quarter O
or O
a O
half O
? O
" O
" O
It O
is O
his O
. O
" O
In O
a O
word O
, O
the O
whale O
was O
seized O
and O
sold O
, O
and O
his O
Grace O
the O
Duke O
of O
Wellington O
received O
the O
money O
. O
Thinking O
that O
viewed O
in O
some O
particular O
lights O
, O
the O
case O
might O
by O
a O
bare O
possibility O
in O
some O
small O
degree O
be O
deemed O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
a O
rather O
hard O
one O
, O
an O
honest O
clergyman O
of O
the O
town O
respectfully O
addressed O
a O
note O
to O
his O
Grace O
, O
begging O
him O
to O
take O
the O
case O
of O
those O
unfortunate O
mariners O
into O
full O
consideration O
. O
To O
which O
my O
Lord O
Duke O
in O
substance O
replied O
( O
both O
letters O
were O
published O
) O
that O
he O
had O
already O
done O
so O
, O
and O
received O
the O
money O
, O
and O
would O
be O
obliged O
to O
the O
reverend O
gentleman O
if O
for O
the O
future O
he O
( O
the O
reverend O
gentleman O
) O
would O
decline O
meddling O
with O
other O
people O
's O
business O
. O
Is O
this O
the O
still O
militant O
old O
man O
, O
standing O
at O
the O
corners O
of O
the O
three O
kingdoms O
, O
on O
all O
hands O
coercing O
alms O
of O
beggars O
? O
It O
will O
readily O
be O
seen O
that O
in O
this O
case O
the O
alleged O
right O
of O
the O
Duke O
to O
the O
whale O
was O
a O
delegated O
one O
from O
the O
Sovereign O
. O
We O
must O
needs O
inquire O
then O
on O
what O
principle O
the O
Sovereign O
is O
originally O
invested O
with O
that O
right O
. O
The O
law O
itself O
has O
already O
been O
set O
forth O
. O
But O
Plowdon O
gives O
us O
the O
reason O
for O
it O
. O
Says O
Plowdon O
, O
the O
whale O
so O
caught O
belongs O
to O
the O
King O
and O
Queen O
, O
" O
because O
of O
its O
superior O
excellence O
. O
" O
And O
by O
the O
soundest O
commentators O
this O
has O
ever O
been O
held O
a O
cogent O
argument O
in O
such O
matters O
. O
But O
why O
should O
the O
King O
have O
the O
head O
, O
and O
the O
Queen O
the O
tail O
? O
A O
reason O
for O
that O
, O
ye O
lawyers O
! O
In O
his O
treatise O
on O
" O
Queen-Gold O
, O
" O
or O
Queen-pin-money O
, O
an O
old O
King O
's O
Bench O
author O
, O
one O
William O
Prynne O
, O
thus O
discourseth O
: O
" O
Ye O
tail O
is O
ye O
Queen O
's O
, O
that O
ye O
Queen O
's O
wardrobe O
may O
be O
supplied O
with O
ye O
whalebone O
. O
" O
Now O
this O
was O
written O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
black O
limber O
bone O
of O
the O
Greenland O
or O
Right O
whale O
was O
largely O
used O
in O
ladies O
' O
bodices O
. O
But O
this O
same O
bone O
is O
not O
in O
the O
tail O
; O
it O
is O
in O
the O
head O
, O
which O
is O
a O
sad O
mistake O
for O
a O
sagacious O
lawyer O
like O
Prynne O
. O
But O
is O
the O
Queen O
a O
mermaid O
, O
to O
be O
presented O
with O
a O
tail O
? O
An O
allegorical O
meaning O
may O
lurk O
here O
. O
There O
are O
two O
royal O
fish O
so O
styled O
by O
the O
English O
law O
writers— O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
sturgeon O
; O
both O
royal O
property O
under O
certain O
limitations O
, O
and O
nominally O
supplying O
the O
tenth O
branch O
of O
the O
crown O
's O
ordinary O
revenue O
. O
I O
know O
not O
that O
any O
other O
author O
has O
hinted O
of O
the O
matter O
; O
but O
by O
inference O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
the O
sturgeon O
must O
be O
divided O
in O
the O
same O
way O
as O
the O
whale O
, O
the O
King O
receiving O
the O
highly O
dense O
and O
elastic O
head O
peculiar O
to O
that O
fish O
, O
which O
, O
symbolically O
regarded O
, O
may O
possibly O
be O
humorously O
grounded O
upon O
some O
presumed O
congeniality O
. O
And O
thus O
there O
seems O
a O
reason O
in O
all O
things O
, O
even O
in O
law O
. O
