If O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
be O
physiognomically O
a O
Sphinx O
, O
to O
the O
phrenologist O
his O
brain O
seems O
that O
geometrical O
circle O
which O
it O
is O
impossible O
to O
square O
. O
In O
the O
full-grown O
creature O
the O
skull O
will O
measure O
at O
least O
twenty O
feet O
in O
length O
. O
Unhinge O
the O
lower O
jaw O
, O
and O
the O
side O
view O
of O
this O
skull O
is O
as O
the O
side O
view O
of O
a O
moderately O
inclined O
plane O
resting O
throughout O
on O
a O
level O
base O
. O
But O
in O
life—as O
we O
have O
elsewhere O
seen—this O
inclined O
plane O
is O
angularly O
filled O
up O
, O
and O
almost O
squared O
by O
the O
enormous O
superincumbent O
mass O
of O
the O
junk O
and O
sperm O
. O
At O
the O
high O
end O
the O
skull O
forms O
a O
crater O
to O
bed O
that O
part O
of O
the O
mass O
; O
while O
under O
the O
long O
floor O
of O
this O
crater—in O
another O
cavity O
seldom O
exceeding O
ten O
inches O
in O
length O
and O
as O
many O
in O
depth O
reposes O
the O
mere O
handful O
of O
this O
monster O
's O
brain O
. O
The O
brain O
is O
at O
least O
twenty O
feet O
from O
his O
apparent O
forehead O
in O
life O
; O
it O
is O
hidden O
away O
behind O
its O
vast O
outworks O
, O
like O
the O
innermost O
citadel O
within O
the O
amplified O
fortifications O
of O
Quebec O
. O
So O
like O
a O
choice O
casket O
is O
it O
secreted O
in O
him O
, O
that O
I O
have O
known O
some O
whalemen O
who O
peremptorily O
deny O
that O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
has O
any O
other O
brain O
than O
that O
palpable O
semblance O
of O
one O
formed O
by O
the O
cubic-yards O
of O
his O
sperm O
magazine O
. O
Lying O
in O
strange O
folds O
, O
courses O
, O
and O
convolutions O
, O
to O
their O
apprehensions O
, O
it O
seems O
more O
in O
keeping O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
his O
general O
might O
to O
regard O
that O
mystic O
part O
of O
him O
as O
the O
seat O
of O
his O
intelligence O
. O
It O
is O
plain O
, O
then O
, O
that O
phrenologically O
the O
head O
of O
this O
Leviathan O
, O
in O
the O
creature O
's O
living O
intact O
state O
, O
is O
an O
entire O
delusion O
. O
As O
for O
his O
true O
brain O
, O
you O
can O
then O
see O
no O
indications O
of O
it O
, O
nor O
feel O
any O
. O
The O
whale O
, O
like O
all O
things O
that O
are O
mighty O
, O
wears O
a O
false O
brow O
to O
the O
common O
world O
. O
If O
you O
unload O
his O
skull O
of O
its O
spermy O
heaps O
and O
then O
take O
a O
rear O
view O
of O
its O
rear O
end O
, O
which O
is O
the O
high O
end O
, O
you O
will O
be O
struck O
by O
its O
resemblance O
to O
the O
human O
skull O
, O
beheld O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
, O
and O
from O
the O
same O
point O
of O
view O
. O
Indeed O
, O
place O
this O
reversed O
skull O
( O
scaled O
down O
to O
the O
human O
magnitude O
) O
among O
a O
plate O
of O
men O
's O
skulls O
, O
and O
you O
would O
involuntarily O
confound O
it O
with O
them O
; O
and O
remarking O
the O
depressions O
on O
one O
part O
of O
its O
summit O
, O
in O
phrenological O
phrase O
you O
would O
say—This O
man O
had O
no O
self-esteem O
, O
and O
no O
veneration O
. O
And O
by O
those O
negations O
, O
considered O
along O
with O
the O
affirmative O
fact O
of O
his O
prodigious O
bulk O
and O
power O
, O
you O
can O
best O
form O
to O
yourself O
the O
truest O
, O
though O
not O
the O
most O
exhilarating O
conception O
of O
what O
the O
most O
exalted O
potency O
is O
. O
But O
if O
from O
the O
comparative O
dimensions O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
proper O
brain O
, O
you O
deem O
it O
incapable O
of O
being O
adequately O
charted O
, O
then O
I O
have O
another O
idea O
for O
you O
. O
If O
you O
attentively O
regard O
almost O
any O
quadruped O
's O
spine O
, O
you O
will O
be O
struck O
with O
the O
resemblance O
of O
its O
vertebrae O
to O
a O
strung O
necklace O
of O
dwarfed O
skulls O
, O
all O
bearing O
rudimental O
resemblance O
to O
the O
skull O
proper O
. O
It O
is O
a O
German O
conceit O
, O
that O
the O
vertebrae O
are O
absolutely O
undeveloped O
skulls O
. O
But O
the O
curious O
external O
resemblance O
, O
I O
take O
it O
the O
Germans O
were O
not O
the O
first O
men O
to O
perceive O
. O
A O
foreign O
friend O
once O
pointed O
it O
out O
to O
me O
, O
in O
the O
skeleton O
of O
a O
foe O
he O
had O
slain O
, O
and O
with O
the O
vertebrae O
of O
which O
he O
was O
inlaying O
, O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
basso-relieve O
, O
the O
beaked O
prow O
of O
his O
canoe O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
consider O
that O
the O
phrenologists O
have O
omitted O
an O
important O
thing O
in O
not O
pushing O
their O
investigations O
from O
the O
cerebellum O
through O
the O
spinal O
canal O
. O
For O
I O
believe O
that O
much O
of O
a O
man O
's O
character O
will O
be O
found O
betokened O
in O
his O
backbone O
. O
I O
would O
rather O
feel O
your O
spine O
than O
your O
skull O
, O
whoever O
you O
are O
. O
A O
thin O
joist O
of O
a O
spine O
never O
yet O
upheld O
a O
full O
and O
noble O
soul O
. O
I O
rejoice O
in O
my O
spine O
, O
as O
in O
the O
firm O
audacious O
staff O
of O
that O
flag O
which O
I O
fling O
half O
out O
to O
the O
world O
. O
Apply O
this O
spinal O
branch O
of O
phrenology O
to O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
. O
His O
cranial O
cavity O
is O
continuous O
with O
the O
first O
neck-vertebra O
; O
and O
in O
that O
vertebra O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
spinal O
canal O
will O
measure O
ten O
inches O
across O
, O
being O
eight O
in O
height O
, O
and O
of O
a O
triangular O
figure O
with O
the O
base O
downwards O
. O
As O
it O
passes O
through O
the O
remaining O
vertebrae O
the O
canal O
tapers O
in O
size O
, O
but O
for O
a O
considerable O
distance O
remains O
of O
large O
capacity O
. O
Now O
, O
of O
course O
, O
this O
canal O
is O
filled O
with O
much O
the O
same O
strangely O
fibrous O
substance—the O
spinal O
cord—as O
the O
brain O
; O
and O
directly O
communicates O
with O
the O
brain O
. O
And O
what O
is O
still O
more O
, O
for O
many O
feet O
after O
emerging O
from O
the O
brain O
's O
cavity O
, O
the O
spinal O
cord O
remains O
of O
an O
undecreasing O
girth O
, O
almost O
equal O
to O
that O
of O
the O
brain O
. O
Under O
all O
these O
circumstances O
, O
would O
it O
be O
unreasonable O
to O
survey O
and O
map O
out O
the O
whale O
's O
spine O
phrenologically O
? O
For O
, O
viewed O
in O
this O
light O
, O
the O
wonderful O
comparative O
smallness O
of O
his O
brain O
proper O
is O
more O
than O
compensated O
by O
the O
wonderful O
comparative O
magnitude O
of O
his O
spinal O
cord O
. O
But O
leaving O
this O
hint O
to O
operate O
as O
it O
may O
with O
the O
phrenologists O
, O
I O
would O
merely O
assume O
the O
spinal O
theory O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
in O
reference O
to O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
hump O
. O
This O
august O
hump O
, O
if O
I O
mistake O
not O
, O
rises O
over O
one O
of O
the O
larger O
vertebrae O
, O
and O
is O
, O
therefore O
, O
in O
some O
sort O
, O
the O
outer O
convex O
mould O
of O
it O
. O
From O
its O
relative O
situation O
then O
, O
I O
should O
call O
this O
high O
hump O
the O
organ O
of O
firmness O
or O
indomitableness O
in O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
. O
And O
that O
the O
great O
monster O
is O
indomitable O
, O
you O
will O
yet O
have O
reason O
to O
know O
. O
