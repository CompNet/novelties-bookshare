HIST O
! O
Did O
you O
hear O
that O
noise O
, O
Cabaco O
? O
It O
was O
the O
middle-watch O
: O
a O
fair O
moonlight O
; O
the O
seamen O
were O
standing O
in O
a O
cordon O
, O
extending O
from O
one O
of O
the O
fresh-water O
butts O
in O
the O
waist O
, O
to O
the O
scuttle-butt O
near O
the O
taffrail O
. O
In O
this O
manner O
, O
they O
passed O
the O
buckets O
to O
fill O
the O
scuttle-butt O
. O
Standing O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
on O
the O
hallowed O
precincts O
of O
the O
quarter-deck O
, O
they O
were O
careful O
not O
to O
speak O
or O
rustle O
their O
feet O
. O
From O
hand O
to O
hand O
, O
the O
buckets O
went O
in O
the O
deepest O
silence O
, O
only O
broken O
by O
the O
occasional O
flap O
of O
a O
sail O
, O
and O
the O
steady O
hum O
of O
the O
unceasingly O
advancing O
keel O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
this O
repose O
, O
that O
Archy O
, O
one O
of O
the O
cordon O
, O
whose O
post O
was O
near O
the O
after-hatches O
, O
whispered O
to O
his O
neighbor O
, O
a O
Cholo O
, O
the O
words O
above O
. O
" O
Hist O
! O
did O
you O

" O
" O
There O
it O
is O
again—under O
the O
hatches—do O
n't O
you O
hear O
it—a O
cough— O
it O
sounded O
like O
a O
cough O
. O
" O
" O
Cough O
be O
damned O
! O
Pass O
along O
that O
return O
bucket O
. O
" O
" O
There O
again—there O
it O
is O
! O
—it O
sounds O
like O
two O
or O
three O
sleepers O
turning O
over O
, O
now O
! O
" O
" O
Caramba O
! O
have O
done O
, O
shipmate O

will O
ye O
? O
It O
's O
the O
three O
soaked O
biscuits O
ye O
eat O
for O
supper O
turning O
over O
inside O
of O
ye—nothing O
else O
. O
Look O
to O
the O
bucket O
! O
" O

Say O
what O
ye O
will O

shipmate O
; O
I O
've O
sharp O
ears O

Aye O
, O
you O
are O
the O
chap O
, O
ai O
n't O
ye O
, O
that O
heard O
the O
hum O
of O
the O
old O
Quakeress O
's O
knitting-needles O
fifty O
miles O
at O
sea O
from O
Nantucket O
; O
you O
're O
the O
chap O
. O
" O
" O
Grin O
away O
; O
we O
'll O
see O
what O
turns O
up O
. O
Hark O
ye O
, O
Cabaco O
, O
there O
is O
somebody O
down O
in O
the O
after-hold O
that O
has O
not O
yet O
been O
seen O
on O
deck O
; O
and O
I O
suspect O
our O
old O
Mogul O
knows O
something O
of O
it O
too O
. O
I O
heard O
Stubb O
tell O
Flask O
, O
one O
morning O
watch O
, O
that O
there O
was O
something O
of O
that O
sort O
in O
the O
wind O
