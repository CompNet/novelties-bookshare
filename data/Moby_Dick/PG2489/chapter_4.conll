Upon O
waking O
next O
morning O
about O
daylight O
, O
I O
found O
Queequeg O
's O
arm O
thrown O
over O
me O
in O
the O
most O
loving O
and O
affectionate O
manner O
. O
You O
had O
almost O
thought O
I O
had O
been O
his O
wife O
. O
The O
counterpane O
was O
of O
patchwork O
, O
full O
of O
odd O
little O
parti-colored O
squares O
and O
triangles O
; O
and O
this O
arm O
of O
his O
tattooed O
all O
over O
with O
an O
interminable O
Cretan O
labyrinth O
of O
a O
figure O
, O
no O
two O
parts O
of O
which O
were O
of O
one O
precise O
shade— O
owing O
I O
suppose O
to O
his O
keeping O
his O
arm O
at O
sea O
unmethodically O
in O
sun O
and O
shade O
, O
his O
shirt O
sleeves O
irregularly O
rolled O
up O
at O
various O
times— O
this O
same O
arm O
of O
his O
, O
I O
say O
, O
looked O
for O
all O
the O
world O
like O
a O
strip O
of O
that O
same O
patchwork O
quilt O
. O
Indeed O
, O
partly O
lying O
on O
it O
as O
the O
arm O
did O
when O
I O
first O
awoke O
, O
I O
could O
hardly O
tell O
it O
from O
the O
quilt O
, O
they O
so O
blended O
their O
hues O
together O
; O
and O
it O
was O
only O
by O
the O
sense O
of O
weight O
and O
pressure O
that O
I O
could O
tell O
that O
Queequeg O
was O
hugging O
me O
. O
My O
sensations O
were O
strange O
. O
Let O
me O
try O
to O
explain O
them O
. O
When O
I O
was O
a O
child O
, O
I O
well O
remember O
a O
somewhat O
similar O
circumstance O
that O
befell O
me O
; O
whether O
it O
was O
a O
reality O
or O
a O
dream O
, O
I O
never O
could O
entirely O
settle O
. O
The O
circumstance O
was O
this O
. O
I O
had O
been O
cutting O
up O
some O
caper O
or O
other— O
I O
think O
it O
was O
trying O
to O
crawl O
up O
the O
chimney O
, O
as O
I O
had O
seen O
a O
little O
sweep O
do O
a O
few O
days O
previous O
; O
and O
my O
stepmother O
who O
, O
somehow O
or O
other O
, O
was O
all O
the O
time O
whipping O
me O
, O
or O
sending O
me O
to O
bed O
supperless O
, O
— O
my O
mother O
dragged O
me O
by O
the O
legs O
out O
of O
the O
chimney O
and O
packed O
me O
off O
to O
bed O
, O
though O
it O
was O
only O
two O
o'clock O
in O
the O
afternoon O
of O
the O
21st O
June O
, O
the O
longest O
day O
in O
the O
year O
in O
our O
hemisphere O
. O
I O
felt O
dreadfully O
. O
But O
there O
was O
no O
help O
for O
it O
, O
so O
up O
stairs O
I O
went O
to O
my O
little O
room O
in O
the O
third O
floor O
, O
undressed O
myself O
as O
slowly O
as O
possible O
so O
as O
to O
kill O
time O
, O
and O
with O
a O
bitter O
sigh O
got O
between O
the O
sheets O
. O
I O
lay O
there O
dismally O
calculating O
that O
sixteen O
entire O
hours O
must O
elapse O
before O
I O
could O
hope O
for O
a O
resurrection O
. O
Sixteen O
hours O
in O
bed O
! O
the O
small O
of O
my O
back O
ached O
to O
think O
of O
it O
. O
And O
it O
was O
so O
light O
too O
; O
the O
sun O
shining O
in O
at O
the O
window O
, O
and O
a O
great O
rattling O
of O
coaches O
in O
the O
streets O
, O
and O
the O
sound O
of O
gay O
voices O
all O
over O
the O
house O
. O
I O
felt O
worse O
and O
worse— O
at O
last O
I O
got O
up O
, O
dressed O
, O
and O
softly O
going O
down O
in O
my O
stockinged O
feet O
, O
sought O
out O
my O
stepmother O
, O
and O
suddenly O
threw O
myself O
at O
her O
feet O
, O
beseeching O
her O
as O
a O
particular O
favor O
to O
give O
me O
a O
good O
slippering O
for O
my O
misbehaviour O
: O
anything O
indeed O
but O
condemning O
me O
to O
lie O
abed O
such O
an O
unendurable O
length O
of O
time O
. O
But O
she O
was O
the O
best O
and O
most O
conscientious O
of O
stepmothers O
, O
and O
back O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
my O
room O
. O
For O
several O
hours O
I O
lay O
there O
broad O
awake O
, O
feeling O
a O
great O
deal O
worse O
than O
I O
have O
ever O
done O
since O
, O
even O
from O
the O
greatest O
subsequent O
misfortunes O
. O
At O
last O
I O
must O
have O
fallen O
into O
a O
troubled O
nightmare O
of O
a O
doze O
; O
and O
slowly O
waking O
from O
it—half O
steeped O
in O
dreams—I O
opened O
my O
eyes O
, O
and O
the O
before O
sunlit O
room O
was O
now O
wrapped O
in O
outer O
darkness O
. O
Instantly O
I O
felt O
a O
shock O
running O
through O
all O
my O
frame O
; O
nothing O
was O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
and O
nothing O
was O
to O
be O
heard O
; O
but O
a O
supernatural O
hand O
seemed O
placed O
in O
mine O
. O
My O
arm O
hung O
over O
the O
counterpane O
, O
and O
the O
nameless O
, O
unimaginable O
, O
silent O
form O
or O
phantom O
, O
to O
which O
the O
hand O
belonged O
, O
seemed O
closely O
seated O
by O
my O
bed-side O
. O
For O
what O
seemed O
ages O
piled O
on O
ages O
, O
I O
lay O
there O
, O
frozen O
with O
the O
most O
awful O
fears O
, O
not O
daring O
to O
drag O
away O
my O
hand O
; O
yet O
ever O
thinking O
that O
if O
I O
could O
but O
stir O
it O
one O
single O
inch O
, O
the O
horrid O
spell O
would O
be O
broken O
. O
I O
knew O
not O
how O
this O
consciousness O
at O
last O
glided O
away O
from O
me O
; O
but O
waking O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
I O
shudderingly O
remembered O
it O
all O
, O
and O
for O
days O
and O
weeks O
and O
months O
afterwards O
I O
lost O
myself O
in O
confounding O
attempts O
to O
explain O
the O
mystery O
. O
Nay O
, O
to O
this O
very O
hour O
, O
I O
often O
puzzle O
myself O
with O
it O
. O
Now O
, O
take O
away O
the O
awful O
fear O
, O
and O
my O
sensations O
at O
feeling O
the O
supernatural O
hand O
in O
mine O
were O
very O
similar O
, O
in O
their O
strangeness O
, O
to O
those O
which O
I O
experienced O
on O
waking O
up O
and O
seeing O
Queequeg O
's O
pagan O
arm O
thrown O
round O
me O
. O
But O
at O
length O
all O
the O
past O
night O
's O
events O
soberly O
recurred O
, O
one O
by O
one O
, O
in O
fixed O
reality O
, O
and O
then O
I O
lay O
only O
alive O
to O
the O
comical O
predicament O
. O
For O
though O
I O
tried O
to O
move O
his O
arm— O
unlock O
his O
bridegroom O
clasp—yet O
, O
sleeping O
as O
he O
was O
, O
he O
still O
hugged O
me O
tightly O
, O
as O
though O
naught O
but O
death O
should O
part O
us O
twain O
. O
I O
now O
strove O
to O
rouse O
him— O
" O
Queequeg O
! O
" O
—but O
his O
only O
answer O
was O
a O
snore O
. O
I O
then O
rolled O
over O
, O
my O
neck O
feeling O
as O
if O
it O
were O
in O
a O
horse-collar O
; O
and O
suddenly O
felt O
a O
slight O
scratch O
. O
Throwing O
aside O
the O
counterpane O
, O
there O
lay O
the O
tomahawk O
sleeping O
by O
the O
savage O
's O
side O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
a O
hatchet-faced O
baby O
. O
A O
pretty O
pickle O
, O
truly O
, O
thought O
I O
; O
abed O
here O
in O
a O
strange O
house O
in O
the O
broad O
day O
, O
with O
a O
cannibal O
and O
a O
tomahawk O
! O
" O
Queequeg O
! O
—in O
the O
name O
of O
goodness O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
wake O
! O
" O
At O
length O
, O
by O
dint O
of O
much O
wriggling O
, O
and O
loud O
and O
incessant O
expostulations O
upon O
the O
unbecomingness O
of O
his O
hugging O
a O
fellow O
male O
in O
that O
matrimonial O
sort O
of O
style O
, O
I O
succeeded O
in O
extracting O
a O
grunt O
; O
and O
presently O
, O
he O
drew O
back O
his O
arm O
, O
shook O
himself O
all O
over O
like O
a O
Newfoundland O
dog O
just O
from O
the O
water O
, O
and O
sat O
up O
in O
bed O
, O
stiff O
as O
a O
pike-staff O
, O
looking O
at O
me O
, O
and O
rubbing O
his O
eyes O
as O
if O
he O
did O
not O
altogether O
remember O
how O
I O
came O
to O
be O
there O
, O
though O
a O
dim O
consciousness O
of O
knowing O
something O
about O
me O
seemed O
slowly O
dawning O
over O
him O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
I O
lay O
quietly O
eyeing O
him O
, O
having O
no O
serious O
misgivings O
now O
, O
and O
bent O
upon O
narrowly O
observing O
so O
curious O
a O
creature O
. O
When O
, O
at O
last O
, O
his O
mind O
seemed O
made O
up O
touching O
the O
character O
of O
his O
bedfellow O
, O
and O
he O
became O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
reconciled O
to O
the O
fact O
; O
he O
jumped O
out O
upon O
the O
floor O
, O
and O
by O
certain O
signs O
and O
sounds O
gave O
me O
to O
understand O
that O
, O
if O
it O
pleased O
me O
, O
he O
would O
dress O
first O
and O
then O
leave O
me O
to O
dress O
afterwards O
, O
leaving O
the O
whole O
apartment O
to O
myself O
. O
Thinks O
I O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
this O
is O
a O
very O
civilized O
overture O
; O
but O
, O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
these O
savages O
have O
an O
innate O
sense O
of O
delicacy O
, O
say O
what O
you O
will O
; O
it O
is O
marvellous O
how O
essentially O
polite O
they O
are O
. O
I O
pay O
this O
particular O
compliment O
to O
Queequeg O
, O
because O
he O
treated O
me O
with O
so O
much O
civility O
and O
consideration O
, O
while O
I O
was O
guilty O
of O
great O
rudeness O
; O
staring O
at O
him O
from O
the O
bed O
, O
and O
watching O
all O
his O
toilette O
motions O
; O
for O
the O
time O
my O
curiosity O
getting O
the O
better O
of O
my O
breeding O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
a O
man O
like O
Queequeg O
you O
do O
n't O
see O
every O
day O
, O
he O
and O
his O
ways O
were O
well O
worth O
unusual O
regarding O
. O
He O
commenced O
dressing O
at O
top O
by O
donning O
his O
beaver O
hat O
, O
a O
very O
tall O
one O
, O
by O
the O
by O
, O
and O
then—still O
minus O
his O
trowsers— O
he O
hunted O
up O
his O
boots O
. O
What O
under O
the O
heavens O
he O
did O
it O
for O
, O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
, O
but O
his O
next O
movement O
was O
to O
crush O
himself— O
boots O
in O
hand O
, O
and O
hat O
on—under O
the O
bed O
; O
when O
, O
from O
sundry O
violent O
gaspings O
and O
strainings O
, O
I O
inferred O
he O
was O
hard O
at O
work O
booting O
himself O
; O
though O
by O
no O
law O
of O
propriety O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
, O
is O
any O
man O
required O
to O
be O
private O
when O
putting O
on O
his O
boots O
. O
But O
Queequeg O
, O
do O
you O
see O
, O
was O
a O
creature O
in O
the O
transition O
state— O
neither O
caterpillar O
nor O
butterfly O
. O
He O
was O
just O
enough O
civilized O
to O
show O
off O
his O
outlandishness O
in O
the O
strangest O
possible O
manner O
. O
His O
education O
was O
not O
yet O
completed O
. O
He O
was O
an O
undergraduate O
. O
If O
he O
had O
not O
been O
a O
small O
degree O
civilized O
, O
he O
very O
probably O
would O
not O
have O
troubled O
himself O
with O
boots O
at O
all O
; O
but O
then O
, O
if O
he O
had O
not O
been O
still O
a O
savage O
, O
he O
never O
would O
have O
dreamt O
of O
getting O
under O
the O
bed O
to O
put O
them O
on O
. O
At O
last O
, O
he O
emerged O
with O
his O
hat O
very O
much O
dented O
and O
crushed O
down O
over O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
began O
creaking O
and O
limping O
about O
the O
room O
, O
as O
if O
, O
not O
being O
much O
accustomed O
to O
boots O
, O
his O
pair O
of O
damp O
, O
wrinkled O
cowhide O
ones— O
probably O
not O
made O
to O
order O
either—rather O
pinched O
and O
tormented O
him O
at O
the O
first O
go O
off O
of O
a O
bitter O
cold O
morning O
. O
Seeing O
, O
now O
, O
that O
there O
were O
no O
curtains O
to O
the O
window O
, O
and O
that O
the O
street O
being O
very O
narrow O
, O
the O
house O
opposite O
commanded O
a O
plain O
view O
into O
the O
room O
, O
and O
observing O
more O
and O
more O
the O
indecorous O
figure O
that O
Queequeg O
made O
, O
staving O
about O
with O
little O
else O
but O
his O
hat O
and O
boots O
on O
; O
I O
begged O
him O
as O
well O
as O
I O
could O
, O
to O
accelerate O
his O
toilet O
somewhat O
, O
and O
particularly O
to O
get O
into O
his O
pantaloons O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
. O
He O
complied O
, O
and O
then O
proceeded O
to O
wash O
himself O
. O
At O
that O
time O
in O
the O
morning O
any O
Christian O
would O
have O
washed O
his O
face O
; O
but O
Queequeg O
, O
to O
my O
amazement O
, O
contented O
himself O
with O
restricting O
his O
ablutions O
to O
his O
chest O
, O
arms O
, O
and O
hands O
. O
He O
then O
donned O
his O
waistcoat O
, O
and O
taking O
up O
a O
piece O
of O
hard O
soap O
on O
the O
wash-stand O
centre O
table O
, O
dipped O
it O
into O
water O
and O
commenced O
lathering O
his O
face O
. O
I O
was O
watching O
to O
see O
where O
he O
kept O
his O
razor O
, O
when O
lo O
and O
behold O
, O
he O
takes O
the O
harpoon O
from O
the O
bed O
corner O
, O
slips O
out O
the O
long O
wooden O
stock O
, O
unsheathes O
the O
head O
, O
whets O
it O
a O
little O
on O
his O
boot O
, O
and O
striding O
up O
to O
the O
bit O
of O
mirror O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
begins O
a O
vigorous O
scraping O
, O
or O
rather O
harpooning O
of O
his O
cheeks O
. O
Thinks O
I O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
this O
is O
using O
Rogers O
's O
best O
cutlery O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O
Afterwards O
I O
wondered O
the O
less O
at O
this O
operation O
when O
I O
came O
to O
know O
of O
what O
fine O
steel O
the O
head O
of O
a O
harpoon O
is O
made O
, O
and O
how O
exceedingly O
sharp O
the O
long O
straight O
edges O
are O
always O
kept O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
his O
toilet O
was O
soon O
achieved O
, O
and O
he O
proudly O
marched O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
wrapped O
up O
in O
his O
great O
pilot O
monkey O
jacket O
, O
and O
sporting O
his O
harpoon O
like O
a O
marshal O
's O
baton O
. O
