I O
shall O
ere O
long O
paint O
to O
you O
as O
well O
as O
one O
can O
without O
canvas O
, O
something O
like O
the O
true O
form O
of O
the O
whale O
as O
he O
actually O
appears O
to O
the O
eye O
of O
the O
whaleman O
when O
in O
his O
own O
absolute O
body O
the O
whale O
is O
moored O
alongside O
the O
whaleship O
so O
that O
he O
can O
be O
fairly O
stepped O
upon O
there O
. O
It O
may O
be O
worth O
while O
, O
therefore O
, O
previously O
to O
advert O
to O
those O
curious O
imaginary O
portraits O
of O
him O
which O
even O
down O
to O
the O
present O
day O
confidently O
challenge O
the O
faith O
of O
the O
landsman O
. O
It O
is O
time O
to O
set O
the O
world O
right O
in O
this O
matter O
, O
by O
proving O
such O
pictures O
of O
the O
whale O
all O
wrong O
. O
It O
may O
be O
that O
the O
primal O
source O
of O
all O
those O
pictorial O
delusions O
will O
be O
found O
among O
the O
oldest O
Hindoo O
, O
Egyptian O
, O
and O
Grecian O
sculptures O
. O
For O
ever O
since O
those O
inventive O
but O
unscrupulous O
times O
when O
on O
the O
marble O
panellings O
of O
temples O
, O
the O
pedestals O
of O
statues O
, O
and O
on O
shields O
, O
medallions O
, O
cups O
, O
and O
coins O
, O
the O
dolphin O
was O
drawn O
in O
scales O
of O
chain-armor O
like O
Saladin O
's O
, O
and O
a O
helmeted O
head O
like O
St. O
George O
's O
; O
ever O
since O
then O
has O
something O
of O
the O
same O
sort O
of O
license O
prevailed O
, O
not O
only O
in O
most O
popular O
pictures O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
but O
in O
many O
scientific O
presentations O
of O
him O
. O
Now O
, O
by O
all O
odds O
, O
the O
most O
ancient O
extant O
portrait O
anyways O
purporting O
to O
be O
the O
whale O
's O
, O
is O
to O
be O
found O
in O
the O
famous O
cavern-pagoda O
of O
Elephants O
, O
in O
India O
. O
The O
Brahmins O
maintain O
that O
in O
the O
almost O
endless O
sculptures O
of O
that O
immemorial O
pagoda O
, O
all O
the O
trades O
and O
pursuits O
, O
every O
conceivable O
avocation O
of O
man O
, O
were O
prefigured O
ages O
before O
any O
of O
them O
actually O
came O
into O
being O
. O
No O
wonder O
then O
, O
that O
in O
some O
sort O
our O
noble O
profession O
of O
whaling O
should O
have O
been O
there O
shadowed O
forth O
. O
The O
Hindoo O
whale O
referred O
to O
, O
occurs O
in O
a O
separate O
department O
of O
the O
wall O
, O
depicting O
the O
incarnation O
of O
Vishnu O
in O
the O
form O
of O
leviathan O
, O
learnedly O
known O
as O
the O
Matse O
Avatar O
. O
But O
though O
this O
sculpture O
is O
half O
man O
and O
half O
whale O
, O
so O
as O
only O
to O
give O
the O
tail O
of O
the O
latter O
, O
yet O
that O
small O
section O
of O
him O
is O
all O
wrong O
. O
It O
looks O
more O
like O
the O
tapering O
tail O
of O
an O
anaconda O
, O
than O
the O
broad O
palms O
of O
the O
true O
whale O
's O
majestic O
flukes O
. O
But O
go O
to O
the O
old O
Galleries O
, O
and O
look O
now O
at O
a O
great O
Christian O
painter O
's O
portrait O
of O
this O
fish O
; O
for O
he O
succeeds O
no O
better O
than O
the O
antediluvian O
Hindoo O
. O
It O
is O
Guido O
's O
picture O
of O
Perseus O
rescuing O
Andromeda O
from O
the O
sea-monster O
or O
whale O
. O
Where O
did O
Guido O
get O
the O
model O
of O
such O
a O
strange O
creature O
as O
that O
? O
Nor O
does O
Hogarth O
, O
in O
painting O
the O
same O
scene O
in O
his O
own O
" O
Perseus O
Descending O
, O
" O
make O
out O
one O
whit O
better O
. O
The O
huge O
corpulence O
of O
that O
Hogarthian O
monster O
undulates O
on O
the O
surface O
, O
scarcely O
drawing O
one O
inch O
of O
water O
. O
It O
has O
a O
sort O
of O
howdah O
on O
its O
back O
, O
and O
its O
distended O
tusked O
mouth O
into O
which O
the O
billows O
are O
rolling O
, O
might O
be O
taken O
for O
the O
Traitors O
' O
Gate O
leading O
from O
the O
Thames O
by O
water O
into O
the O
Tower O
. O
Then O
, O
there O
are O
the O
Prodromus O
whales O
of O
the O
old O
Scotch O
Sibbald O
, O
and O
Jonah O
's O
whale O
, O
as O
depicted O
in O
the O
prints O
of O
old O
Bibles O
and O
the O
cuts O
of O
old O
primers O
. O
What O
shall O
be O
said O
of O
these O
? O
As O
for O
the O
book-binder O
's O
whale O
winding O
like O
a O
vine-stalk O
round O
the O
stock O
of O
a O
descending O
anchor— O
as O
stamped O
and O
gilded O
on O
the O
backs O
and O
titlepages O
of O
many O
books O
both O
old O
and O
new—that O
is O
a O
very O
picturesque O
but O
purely O
fabulous O
creature O
, O
imitated O
, O
I O
take O
it O
, O
from O
the O
like O
figures O
on O
antique O
vases O
. O
Though O
universally O
denominated O
a O
dolphin O
, O
I O
nevertheless O
call O
this O
book-binder O
's O
fish O
an O
attempt O
at O
a O
whale O
; O
because O
it O
was O
so O
intended O
when O
the O
device O
was O
first O
introduced O
. O
It O
was O
introduced O
by O
an O
old O
Italian O
publisher O
somewhere O
about O
the O
15th O
century O
, O
during O
the O
Revival O
of O
Learning O
; O
and O
in O
those O
days O
, O
and O
even O
down O
to O
a O
comparatively O
late O
period O
, O
dolphins O
were O
popularly O
supposed O
to O
be O
a O
species O
of O
the O
Leviathan O
. O
In O
the O
vignettes O
and O
other O
embellishments O
of O
some O
ancient O
books O
you O
will O
at O
times O
meet O
with O
very O
curious O
touches O
at O
the O
whale O
, O
where O
all O
manner O
of O
spouts O
, O
jets O
d'eau O
, O
hot O
springs O
and O
cold O
, O
Saratoga O
and O
Baden-Baden O
, O
come O
bubbling O
up O
from O
his O
unexhausted O
brain O
. O
In O
the O
title-page O
of O
the O
original O
edition O
of O
the O
" O
Advancement O
of O
Learning O
" O
you O
will O
find O
some O
curious O
whales O
. O
But O
quitting O
all O
these O
unprofessional O
attempts O
, O
let O
us O
glance O
at O
those O
pictures O
of O
leviathan O
purporting O
to O
be O
sober O
, O
scientific O
delineations O
, O
by O
those O
who O
know O
. O
In O
old O
Harris O
's O
collection O
of O
voyages O
there O
are O
some O
plates O
of O
whales O
extracted O
from O
a O
Dutch O
book O
of O
voyages O
, O
A.D. O
1671 O
, O
entitled O
" O
A O
Whaling O
Voyage O
to O
Spitzbergen O
in O
the O
ship O
Jonas O
in O
the O
Whale O
, O
Peter O
Peterson O
of O
Friesland O
, O
master O
. O
" O
In O
one O
of O
those O
plates O
the O
whales O
, O
like O
great O
rafts O
of O
logs O
, O
are O
represented O
lying O
among O
ice-isles O
, O
with O
white O
bears O
running O
over O
their O
living O
backs O
. O
In O
another O
plate O
, O
the O
prodigious O
blunder O
is O
made O
of O
representing O
the O
whale O
with O
perpendicular O
flukes O
. O
Then O
again O
, O
there O
is O
an O
imposing O
quarto O
, O
written O
by O
one O
Captain O
Colnett O
, O
a O
Post O
Captain O
in O
the O
English O
navy O
, O
entitled O
" O
A O
Voyage O
round O
Cape O
Horn O
into O
the O
South O
Seas O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
extending O
the O
Spermaceti O
Whale O
Fisheries O
. O
" O
In O
this O
book O
is O
an O
outline O
purporting O
to O
be O
a O
" O
Picture O
of O
a O
Physeter O
or O
Spermaceti O
whale O
, O
drawn O
by O
scale O
from O
one O
killed O
on O
the O
coast O
of O
Mexico O
, O
August O
, O
1793 O
, O
and O
hoisted O
on O
deck O
. O
" O
I O
doubt O
not O
the O
captain O
had O
this O
veracious O
picture O
taken O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
his O
marines O
. O
To O
mention O
but O
one O
thing O
about O
it O
, O
let O
me O
say O
that O
it O
has O
an O
eye O
which O
applied O
, O
according O
to O
the O
accompanying O
scale O
, O
to O
a O
full O
grown O
sperm O
whale O
, O
would O
make O
the O
eye O
of O
that O
whale O
a O
bow-window O
some O
five O
feet O
long O
. O
Ah O
, O
my O
gallant O
captain O
, O
why O
did O
ye O
not O
give O
us O
Jonah O
looking O
out O
of O
that O
eye O
! O
Nor O
are O
the O
most O
conscientious O
compilations O
of O
Natural O
History O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
young O
and O
tender O
, O
free O
from O
the O
same O
heinousness O
of O
mistake O
. O
Look O
at O
that O
popular O
work O
" O
Goldsmith O
's O
Animated O
Nature O
. O
" O
In O
the O
abridged O
London O
edition O
of O
1807 O
, O
there O
are O
plates O
of O
an O
alleged O
" O
whale O
" O
and O
a O
" O
narwhale O
. O
" O
I O
do O
not O
wish O
to O
seem O
inelegant O
, O
but O
this O
unsightly O
whale O
looks O
much O
like O
an O
amputated O
sow O
; O
and O
, O
as O
for O
the O
narwhale O
, O
one O
glimpse O
at O
it O
is O
enough O
to O
amaze O
one O
, O
that O
in O
this O
nineteenth O
century O
such O
a O
hippogriff O
could O
be O
palmed O
for O
genuine O
upon O
any O
intelligent O
public O
of O
schoolboys O
. O
Then O
, O
again O
, O
in O
1825 O
, O
Bernard O
Germain O
, O
Count O
de O
Lacepede O
, O
a O
great O
naturalist O
, O
published O
a O
scientific O
systemized O
whale O
book O
, O
wherein O
are O
several O
pictures O
of O
the O
different O
species O
of O
the O
Leviathan O
. O
All O
these O
are O
not O
only O
incorrect O
, O
but O
the O
picture O
of O
the O
Mysticetus O
or O
Greenland O
whale O
( O
that O
is O
to O
say O
the O
Right O
whale O
) O
, O
even O
Scoresby O
, O
a O
long O
experienced O
man O
as O
touching O
that O
species O
, O
declares O
not O
to O
have O
its O
counterpart O
in O
nature O
. O
But O
the O
placing O
of O
the O
cap-sheaf O
to O
all O
this O
blundering O
business O
was O
reserved O
for O
the O
scientific O
Frederick O
Cuvier O
, O
brother O
to O
the O
famous O
Baron O
. O
In O
1836 O
, O
he O
published O
a O
Natural O
History O
of O
Whales O
, O
in O
which O
he O
gives O
what O
he O
calls O
a O
picture O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
. O
Before O
showing O
that O
picture O
to O
any O
Nantucketer O
, O
you O
had O
best O
provide O
for O
your O
summary O
retreat O
from O
Nantucket O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
Frederick O
Cuvier O
's O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
not O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
but O
a O
squash O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
he O
never O
had O
the O
benefit O
of O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
( O
such O
men O
seldom O
have O
) O
, O
but O
whence O
he O
derived O
that O
picture O
, O
who O
can O
tell O
? O
Perhaps O
he O
got O
it O
as O
his O
scientific O
predecessor O
in O
the O
same O
field O
, O
Desmarest O
, O
got O
one O
of O
his O
authentic O
abortions O
; O
that O
is O
, O
from O
a O
Chinese O
drawing O
. O
And O
what O
sort O
of O
lively O
lads O
with O
the O
pencil O
those O
Chinese O
are O
, O
many O
queer O
cups O
and O
saucers O
inform O
us O
. O
As O
for O
the O
sign-painters O
' O
whales O
seen O
in O
the O
streets O
hanging O
over O
the O
shops O
of O
oil-dealers O
, O
what O
shall O
be O
said O
of O
them O
? O
They O
are O
generally O
Richard O
III O
. O
whales O
, O
with O
dromedary O
humps O
, O
and O
very O
savage O
; O
breakfasting O
on O
three O
or O
four O
sailor O
tarts O
, O
that O
is O
whaleboats O
full O
of O
mariners O
: O
their O
deformities O
floundering O
in O
seas O
of O
blood O
and O
blue O
paint O
. O
But O
these O
manifold O
mistakes O
in O
depicting O
the O
whale O
are O
not O
so O
very O
surprising O
after O
all O
. O
Consider O
! O
Most O
of O
the O
scientific O
drawings O
have O
been O
taken O
from O
the O
stranded O
fish O
; O
and O
these O
are O
about O
as O
correct O
as O
a O
drawing O
of O
a O
wrecked O
ship O
, O
with O
broken O
back O
, O
would O
correctly O
represent O
the O
noble O
animal O
itself O
in O
all O
its O
undashed O
pride O
of O
hull O
and O
spars O
. O
Though O
elephants O
have O
stood O
for O
their O
full-lengths O
, O
the O
living O
Leviathan O
has O
never O
yet O
fairly O
floated O
himself O
for O
his O
portrait O
. O
The O
living O
whale O
, O
in O
his O
full O
majesty O
and O
significance O
, O
is O
only O
to O
be O
seen O
at O
sea O
in O
unfathomable O
waters O
; O
and O
afloat O
the O
vast O
bulk O
of O
him O
is O
out O
of O
sight O
, O
like O
a O
launched O
line-of-battle O
ship O
; O
and O
out O
of O
that O
element O
it O
is O
a O
thing O
eternally O
impossible O
for O
mortal O
man O
to O
hoist O
him O
bodily O
into O
the O
air O
, O
so O
as O
to O
preserve O
all O
his O
mighty O
swells O
and O
undulations O
. O
And O
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
highly O
presumable O
difference O
of O
contour O
between O
a O
young O
suckling O
whale O
and O
a O
full-grown O
Platonian O
Leviathan O
; O
yet O
, O
even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
one O
of O
those O
young O
sucking O
whales O
hoisted O
to O
a O
ship O
's O
deck O
, O
such O
is O
then O
the O
outlandish O
, O
eel-like O
, O
limbered O
, O
varying O
shape O
of O
him O
, O
that O
his O
precise O
expression O
the O
devil O
himself O
could O
not O
catch O
. O
But O
it O
may O
be O
fancied O
, O
that O
from O
the O
naked O
skeleton O
of O
the O
stranded O
whale O
, O
accurate O
hints O
may O
be O
derived O
touching O
his O
true O
form O
. O
Not O
at O
all O
. O
For O
it O
is O
one O
of O
the O
more O
curious O
things O
about O
this O
Leviathan O
, O
that O
his O
skeleton O
gives O
very O
little O
idea O
of O
his O
general O
shape O
. O
Though O
Jeremy O
Bentham O
's O
skeleton O
, O
which O
hangs O
for O
candelabra O
in O
the O
library O
of O
one O
of O
his O
executors O
, O
correctly O
conveys O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
burly-browed O
utilitarian O
old O
gentleman O
, O
with O
all O
Jeremy O
's O
other O
leading O
personal O
characteristics O
; O
yet O
nothing O
of O
this O
kind O
could O
be O
inferred O
from O
any O
leviathan O
's O
articulated O
bones O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
as O
the O
great O
Hunter O
says O
, O
the O
mere O
skeleton O
of O
the O
whale O
bears O
the O
same O
relation O
to O
the O
fully O
invested O
and O
padded O
animal O
as O
the O
insect O
does O
to O
the O
chrysalis O
that O
so O
roundingly O
envelopes O
it O
. O
This O
peculiarity O
is O
strikingly O
evinced O
in O
the O
head O
, O
as O
in O
some O
part O
of O
this O
book O
will O
be O
incidentally O
shown O
. O
It O
is O
also O
very O
curiously O
displayed O
in O
the O
side O
fin O
, O
the O
bones O
of O
which O
almost O
exactly O
answer O
to O
the O
bones O
of O
the O
human O
hand O
, O
minus O
only O
the O
thumb O
. O
This O
fin O
has O
four O
regular O
bone-fingers O
, O
the O
index O
, O
middle O
, O
ring O
, O
and O
little O
finger O
. O
But O
all O
these O
are O
permanently O
lodged O
in O
their O
fleshy O
covering O
, O
as O
the O
human O
fingers O
in O
an O
artificial O
covering O
. O
" O
However O
recklessly O
the O
whale O
may O
sometimes O
serve O
us O
, O
" O
said O
humorous O
Stubb O
one O
day O
, O
" O
he O
can O
never O
be O
truly O
said O
to O
handle O
us O
without O
mittens O
. O
" O
For O
all O
these O
reasons O
, O
then O
, O
any O
way O
you O
may O
look O
at O
it O
, O
you O
must O
needs O
conclude O
that O
the O
great O
Leviathan O
is O
that O
one O
creature O
in O
the O
world O
which O
must O
remain O
unpainted O
to O
the O
last O
. O
True O
, O
one O
portrait O
may O
hit O
the O
mark O
much O
nearer O
than O
another O
, O
but O
none O
can O
hit O
it O
with O
any O
very O
considerable O
degree O
of O
exactness O
. O
So O
there O
is O
no O
earthly O
way O
of O
finding O
out O
precisely O
what O
the O
whale O
really O
looks O
like O
. O
And O
the O
only O
mode O
in O
which O
you O
can O
derive O
even O
a O
tolerable O
idea O
of O
his O
living O
contour O
, O
is O
by O
going O
a O
whaling O
yourself O
; O
but O
by O
so O
doing O
, O
you O
run O
no O
small O
risk O
of O
being O
eternally O
stove O
and O
sunk O
by O
him O
. O
Wherefore O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
me O
you O
had O
best O
not O
be O
too O
fastidious O
in O
your O
curiosity O
touching O
this O
Leviathan O
. O
