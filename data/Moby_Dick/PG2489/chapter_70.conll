It O
should O
not O
have O
been O
omitted O
that O
previous O
to O
completely O
stripping O
the O
body O
of O
the O
leviathan O
, O
he O
was O
beheaded O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
beheading O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
a O
scientific O
anatomical O
feat O
, O
upon O
which O
experienced O
whale O
surgeons O
very O
much O
pride O
themselves O
: O
and O
not O
without O
reason O
. O
Consider O
that O
the O
whale O
has O
nothing O
that O
can O
properly O
be O
called O
a O
neck O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
where O
his O
head O
and O
body O
seem O
to O
join O
, O
there O
, O
in O
that O
very O
place O
, O
is O
the O
thickest O
part O
of O
him O
. O
Remember O
, O
also O
, O
that O
the O
surgeon O
must O
operate O
from O
above O
, O
some O
eight O
or O
ten O
feet O
intervening O
between O
him O
and O
his O
subject O
, O
and O
that O
subject O
almost O
hidden O
in O
a O
discolored O
, O
rolling O
, O
and O
oftentimes O
tumultuous O
and O
bursting O
sea O
. O
Bear O
in O
mind O
, O
too O
, O
that O
under O
these O
untoward O
circumstances O
he O
has O
to O
cut O
many O
feet O
deep O
in O
the O
flesh O
; O
and O
in O
that O
subterraneous O
manner O
, O
without O
so O
much O
as O
getting O
one O
single O
peep O
into O
the O
ever-contracting O
gash O
thus O
made O
, O
he O
must O
skilfully O
steer O
clear O
of O
all O
adjacent O
, O
interdicted O
parts O
, O
and O
exactly O
divide O
the O
spine O
at O
a O
critical O
point O
hard O
by O
its O
insertion O
into O
the O
skull O
. O
Do O
you O
not O
marvel O
, O
then O
, O
at O
Stubb O
's O
boast O
, O
that O
he O
demanded O
but O
ten O
minutes O
to O
behead O
a O
sperm O
whale O
? O
When O
first O
severed O
, O
the O
head O
is O
dropped O
astern O
and O
held O
there O
by O
a O
cable O
till O
the O
body O
is O
stripped O
. O
That O
done O
, O
if O
it O
belong O
to O
a O
small O
whale O
it O
is O
hoisted O
on O
deck O
to O
be O
deliberately O
disposed O
of O
. O
But O
, O
with O
a O
full O
grown O
leviathan O
this O
is O
impossible O
; O
for O
the O
sperm O
whale O
's O
head O
embraces O
nearly O
one O
third O
of O
his O
entire O
bulk O
, O
and O
completely O
to O
suspend O
such O
a O
burden O
as O
that O
, O
even O
by O
the O
immense O
tackles O
of O
a O
whaler O
, O
this O
were O
as O
vain O
a O
thing O
as O
to O
attempt O
weighing O
a O
Dutch O
barn O
in O
jewellers O
' O
scales O
. O
The O
Pequod O
's O
whale O
being O
decapitated O
and O
the O
body O
stripped O
, O
the O
head O
was O
hoisted O
against O
the O
ship O
's O
side—about O
half O
way O
out O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
so O
that O
it O
might O
yet O
in O
great O
part O
be O
buoyed O
up O
by O
its O
native O
element O
. O
And O
there O
with O
the O
strained O
craft O
steeply O
leaning O
over O
to O
it O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
the O
enormous O
downward O
drag O
from O
the O
lower O
mast-head O
, O
and O
every O
yard-arm O
on O
that O
side O
projecting O
like O
a O
crane O
over O
the O
waves O
; O
there O
, O
that O
blood-dripping O
head O
hung O
to O
the O
Pequod O
's O
waist O
like O
the O
giant O
Holofernes O
's O
from O
the O
girdle O
of O
Judith O
. O
When O
this O
last O
task O
was O
accomplished O
it O
was O
noon O
, O
and O
the O
seamen O
went O
below O
to O
their O
dinner O
. O
Silence O
reigned O
over O
the O
before O
tumultuous O
but O
now O
deserted O
deck O
. O
An O
intense O
copper O
calm O
, O
like O
a O
universal O
yellow O
lotus O
, O
was O
more O
and O
more O
unfolding O
its O
noiseless O
measureless O
leaves O
upon O
the O
sea O
. O
A O
short O
space O
elapsed O
, O
and O
up O
into O
this O
noiselessness O
came O
Ahab O
alone O
from O
his O
cabin O
. O
Taking O
a O
few O
turns O
on O
the O
quarter-deck O
, O
he O
paused O
to O
gaze O
over O
the O
side O
, O
then O
slowly O
getting O
into O
the O
main-chains O
he O
took O
Stubb O
's O
long O
spade O
still O
remaining O
there O
after O
the O
whale O
's O
decapitation O
and O
striking O
it O
into O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
half-suspended O
mass O
, O
placed O
its O
other O
end O
crutchwise O
under O
one O
arm O
, O
and O
so O
stood O
leaning O
over O
with O
eyes O
attentively O
fixed O
on O
this O
head O
. O
It O
was O
a O
black O
and O
hooded O
head O
; O
and O
hanging O
there O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
so O
intense O
a O
calm O
, O
it O
seemed O
the O
Sphynx O
's O
in O
the O
desert O
. O
" O
Speak O
, O
thou O
vast O
and O
venerable O
head O
, O
" O
muttered O
Ahab O
, O
" O
which O
, O
though O
ungarnished O
with O
a O
beard O
, O
yet O
here O
and O
there O
lookest O
hoary O
with O
mosses O
; O
speak O
, O
mighty O
head O
, O
and O
tell O
us O
the O
secret O
thing O
that O
is O
in O
thee O
. O
Of O
all O
divers O
, O
thou O
hast O
dived O
the O
deepest O
. O
That O
head O
upon O
which O
the O
upper O
sun O
now O
gleams O
, O
has O
moved O
amid O
this O
world O
's O
foundations O
. O
Where O
unrecorded O
names O
and O
navies O
rust O
, O
and O
untold O
hopes O
and O
anchors O
rot O
; O
where O
in O
her O
murderous O
hold O
this O
frigate O
earth O
is O
ballasted O
with O
bones O
of O
millions O
of O
the O
drowned O
; O
there O
, O
in O
that O
awful O
water-land O
, O
there O
was O
thy O
most O
familiar O
home O
. O
Thou O
hast O
been O
where O
bell O
or O
diver O
never O
went O
; O
hast O
slept O
by O
many O
a O
sailor O
's O
side O
, O
where O
sleepless O
mothers O
would O
give O
their O
lives O
to O
lay O
them O
down O
. O
Thou O
saw'st O
the O
locked O
lovers O
when O
leaping O
from O
their O
flaming O
ship O
; O
heart O
to O
heart O
they O
sank O
beneath O
the O
exulting O
wave O
; O
true O
to O
each O
other O
, O
when O
heaven O
seemed O
false O
to O
them O
. O
Thou O
saw'st O
the O
murdered O
mate O
when O
tossed O
by O
pirates O
from O
the O
midnight O
deck O
; O
for O
hours O
he O
fell O
into O
the O
deeper O
midnight O
of O
the O
insatiate O
maw O
; O
and O
his O
murderers O
still O
sailed O
on O
unharmed— O
while O
swift O
lightnings O
shivered O
the O
neighboring O
ship O
that O
would O
have O
borne O
a O
righteous O
husband O
to O
outstretched O
, O
longing O
arms O
. O
O O
head O
! O
thou O
hast O
seen O
enough O
to O
split O
the O
planets O
and O
make O
an O
infidel O
of O
Abraham O
, O
and O
not O
one O
syllable O
is O
thine O
! O
" O
" O
Sail O
ho O
! O
" O
cried O
a O
triumphant O
voice O
from O
the O
main-mast-head O
. O
" O
Aye O
? O
Well O
, O
now O
, O
that O
's O
cheering O
, O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
suddenly O
erecting O
himself O
, O
while O
whole O
thunder-clouds O
swept O
aside O
from O
his O
brow O
. O
" O
That O
lively O
cry O
upon O
this O
deadly O
calm O
might O
almost O
convert O
a O
better O
man.—Where O
away O
? O

Three O
points O
on O

starboard O
bow O

down O
her O
breeze O
to O
us O
! O

Better O
and O
better O

man O

Would O
now O
St. O
Paul O
would O
come O
along O
that O
way O
, O
and O
to O
my O
breezelessness O
bring O
his O
breeze O

how O
far O

your O
