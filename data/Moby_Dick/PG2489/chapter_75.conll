Crossing O
the O
deck O
, O
let O
us O
now O
have O
a O
good O
long O
look O
at O
the O
the O
Right O
Whale O
's O
head O
. O
As O
in O
general O
shape O
the O
noble O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
head O
may O
be O
compared O
to O
a O
Roman O
war-chariot O
( O
especially O
in O
front O
, O
where O
it O
is O
so O
broadly O
rounded O
) O
; O
so O
, O
at O
a O
broad O
view O
, O
the O
Right O
Whale O
's O
head O
bears O
a O
rather O
inelegant O
resemblance O
to O
a O
gigantic O
galliot-toed O
shoe O
. O
Two O
hundred O
years O
ago O
an O
old O
Dutch O
voyager O
likened O
its O
shape O
to O
that O
of O
a O
shoemaker O
's O
last O
. O
And O
in O
this O
same O
last O
or O
shoe O
, O
that O
old O
woman O
of O
the O
nursery O
tale O
with O
the O
swarming O
brood O
, O
might O
very O
comfortably O
be O
lodged O
, O
she O
and O
all O
her O
progeny O
. O
But O
as O
you O
come O
nearer O
to O
this O
great O
head O
it O
begins O
to O
assume O
different O
aspects O
, O
according O
to O
your O
point O
of O
view O
. O
If O
you O
stand O
on O
its O
summit O
and O
look O
at O
these O
two O
f-shaped O
spout-holes O
, O
you O
would O
take O
the O
whole O
head O
for O
an O
enormous O
bass O
viol O
, O
and O
these O
spiracles O
, O
the O
apertures O
in O
its O
soundingboard O
. O
Then O
, O
again O
, O
if O
you O
fix O
your O
eye O
upon O
this O
strange O
, O
crested O
, O
comblike O
incrustation O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
mass—this O
green O
, O
barnacled O
thing O
, O
which O
the O
Greenlanders O
call O
the O
" O
crown O
, O
" O
and O
the O
Southern O
fishers O
the O
" O
bonnet O
" O
of O
the O
Right O
Whale O
; O
fixing O
your O
eyes O
solely O
on O
this O
, O
you O
would O
take O
the O
head O
for O
the O
trunk O
of O
some O
huge O
oak O
, O
with O
a O
bird O
's O
nest O
in O
its O
crotch O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
when O
you O
watch O
those O
live O
crabs O
that O
nestle O
here O
on O
this O
bonnet O
, O
such O
an O
idea O
will O
be O
almost O
sure O
to O
occur O
to O
you O
; O
unless O
, O
indeed O
, O
your O
fancy O
has O
been O
fixed O
by O
the O
technical O
term O
" O
crown O
" O
also O
bestowed O
upon O
it O
; O
in O
which O
case O
you O
will O
take O
great O
interest O
in O
thinking O
how O
this O
mighty O
monster O
is O
actually O
a O
diademed O
king O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
whose O
green O
crown O
has O
been O
put O
together O
for O
him O
in O
this O
marvellous O
manner O
. O
But O
if O
this O
whale O
be O
a O
king O
, O
he O
is O
a O
very O
sulky O
looking O
fellow O
to O
grace O
a O
diadem O
. O
Look O
at O
that O
hanging O
lower O
lip O
! O
what O
a O
huge O
sulk O
and O
pout O
is O
there O
! O
a O
sulk O
and O
pout O
, O
by O
carpenter O
's O
measurement O
, O
about O
twenty O
feet O
long O
and O
five O
feet O
deep O
; O
a O
sulk O
and O
pout O
that O
will O
yield O
you O
some O
500 O
gallons O
of O
oil O
and O
more O
. O
A O
great O
pity O
, O
now O
, O
that O
this O
unfortunate O
whale O
should O
be O
hare-lipped O
. O
The O
fissure O
is O
about O
a O
foot O
across O
. O
Probably O
the O
mother O
during O
an O
important O
interval O
was O
sailing O
down O
the O
Peruvian O
coast O
, O
when O
earthquakes O
caused O
the O
beach O
to O
gape O
. O
Over O
this O
lip O
, O
as O
over O
a O
slippery O
threshold O
, O
we O
now O
slide O
into O
the O
mouth O
. O
Upon O
my O
word O
were O
I O
at O
Mackinaw O
, O
I O
should O
take O
this O
to O
be O
the O
inside O
of O
an O
Indian O
wigwam O
. O
Good O
Lord O
! O
is O
this O
the O
road O
that O
Jonah O
went O
? O
The O
roof O
is O
about O
twelve O
feet O
high O
, O
and O
runs O
to O
a O
pretty O
sharp O
angle O
, O
as O
if O
there O
were O
a O
regular O
ridge-pole O
there O
; O
while O
these O
ribbed O
, O
arched O
, O
hairy O
sides O
, O
present O
us O
with O
those O
wondrous O
, O
half O
vertical O
, O
scimitar-shaped O
slats O
of O
whalebone O
, O
say O
three O
hundred O
on O
a O
side O
, O
which O
depending O
from O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
head O
or O
crown O
bone O
, O
form O
those O
Venetian O
blinds O
which O
have O
elsewhere O
been O
cursorily O
mentioned O
. O
The O
edges O
of O
these O
bones O
are O
fringed O
with O
hairy O
fibres O
, O
through O
which O
the O
Right O
Whale O
strains O
the O
water O
, O
and O
in O
whose O
intricacies O
he O
retains O
the O
small O
fish O
, O
when O
openmouthed O
he O
goes O
through O
the O
seas O
of O
brit O
in O
feeding O
time O
. O
In O
the O
central O
blinds O
of O
bone O
, O
as O
they O
stand O
in O
their O
natural O
order O
, O
there O
are O
certain O
curious O
marks O
, O
curves O
, O
hollows O
, O
and O
ridges O
, O
whereby O
some O
whalemen O
calculate O
the O
creature O
's O
age O
, O
as O
the O
age O
of O
an O
oak O
by O
its O
circular O
rings O
. O
Though O
the O
certainty O
of O
this O
criterion O
is O
far O
from O
demonstrable O
, O
yet O
it O
has O
the O
savor O
of O
analogical O
probability O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
if O
we O
yield O
to O
it O
, O
we O
must O
grant O
a O
far O
greater O
age O
to O
the O
Right O
Whale O
than O
at O
first O
glance O
will O
seem O
reasonable O
. O
In O
old O
times O
, O
there O
seem O
to O
have O
prevailed O
the O
most O
curious O
fancies O
concerning O
these O
blinds O
. O
One O
voyager O
in O
Purchas O
calls O
them O
the O
wondrous O
" O
whiskers O
" O
inside O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
mouth O
; O
* O
another O
, O
" O
hogs O
' O
bristles O
" O
; O
a O
third O
old O
gentleman O
in O
Hackluyt O
uses O
the O
following O
elegant O
language O
: O
" O
There O
are O
about O
two O
hundred O
and O
fifty O
fins O
growing O
on O
each O
side O
of O
his O
upper O
chop O
, O
which O
arch O
over O
his O
tongue O
on O
each O
side O
of O
his O
mouth O
. O
" O
* O
This O
reminds O
us O
that O
the O
Right O
Whale O
really O
has O
a O
sort O
of O
whisker O
, O
or O
rather O
a O
moustache O
, O
consisting O
of O
a O
few O
scattered O
white O
hairs O
on O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
the O
outer O
end O
of O
the O
lower O
jaw O
. O
Sometimes O
these O
tufts O
impart O
a O
rather O
brigandish O
expression O
to O
his O
otherwise O
solemn O
countenance O
. O
As O
every O
one O
knows O
, O
these O
same O
" O
hogs O
' O
bristles O
, O
" O
" O
fins O
, O
" O
" O
whiskers O
, O
" O
" O
blinds O
, O
" O
or O
whatever O
you O
please O
, O
furnish O
to O
the O
ladies O
their O
busks O
and O
other O
stiffening O
contrivances O
. O
But O
in O
this O
particular O
, O
the O
demand O
has O
long O
been O
on O
the O
decline O
. O
It O
was O
in O
Queen O
Anne O
's O
time O
that O
the O
bone O
was O
in O
its O
glory O
, O
the O
farthingale O
being O
then O
all O
the O
fashion O
. O
And O
as O
those O
ancient O
dames O
moved O
about O
gaily O
, O
though O
in O
the O
jaws O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
as O
you O
may O
say O
; O
even O
so O
, O
in O
a O
shower O
, O
with O
the O
like O
thoughtlessness O
, O
do O
we O
nowadays O
fly O
under O
the O
same O
jaws O
for O
protection O
; O
the O
umbrella O
being O
a O
tent O
spread O
over O
the O
same O
bone O
. O
But O
now O
forget O
all O
about O
blinds O
and O
whiskers O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
, O
standing O
in O
the O
Right O
Whale O
's O
mouth O
, O
look O
around O
you O
afresh O
. O
Seeing O
all O
these O
colonnades O
of O
bone O
so O
methodically O
ranged O
about O
, O
would O
you O
not O
think O
you O
were O
inside O
of O
the O
great O
Haarlem O
organ O
, O
and O
gazing O
upon O
its O
thousand O
pipes O
? O
For O
a O
carpet O
to O
the O
organ O
we O
have O
a O
rug O
of O
the O
softest O
Turkey—the O
tongue O
, O
which O
is O
glued O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
to O
the O
floor O
of O
the O
mouth O
. O
It O
is O
very O
fat O
and O
tender O
, O
and O
apt O
to O
tear O
in O
pieces O
in O
hoisting O
it O
on O
deck O
. O
This O
particular O
tongue O
now O
before O
us O
; O
at O
a O
passing O
glance O
I O
should O
say O
it O
was O
a O
six-barreler O
; O
that O
is O
, O
it O
will O
yield O
you O
about O
that O
amount O
of O
oil O
. O
Ere O
this O
, O
you O
must O
have O
plainly O
seen O
the O
truth O
of O
what O
I O
started O
with— O
that O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
and O
the O
Right O
Whale O
have O
almost O
entirely O
different O
heads O
. O
To O
sum O
up O
, O
then O
: O
in O
the O
Right O
Whale O
's O
there O
is O
no O
great O
well O
of O
sperm O
; O
no O
ivory O
teeth O
at O
all O
; O
no O
long O
, O
slender O
mandible O
of O
a O
lower O
jaw O
, O
like O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
. O
Nor O
in O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
are O
there O
any O
of O
those O
blinds O
of O
bone O
; O
no O
huge O
lower O
lip O
; O
and O
scarcely O
anything O
of O
a O
tongue O
. O
Again O
, O
the O
Right O
Whale O
has O
two O
external O
spout-holes O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
only O
one O
. O
Look O
your O
last O
now O
, O
on O
these O
venerable O
hooded O
heads O
, O
while O
they O
yet O
lie O
together O
; O
for O
one O
will O
soon O
sink O
, O
unrecorded O
, O
in O
the O
sea O
; O
the O
other O
will O
not O
be O
very O
long O
in O
following O
. O
Can O
you O
catch O
the O
expression O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
there O
? O
It O
is O
the O
same O
he O
died O
with O
, O
only O
some O
of O
the O
longer O
wrinkles O
in O
the O
forehead O
seem O
now O
faded O
away O
. O
I O
think O
his O
broad O
brow O
to O
be O
full O
of O
a O
prairie-like O
placidity O
, O
born O
of O
a O
speculative O
indifference O
as O
to O
death O
. O
But O
mark O
the O
other O
head O
's O
expression O
. O
See O
that O
amazing O
lower O
lip O
, O
pressed O
by O
accident O
against O
the O
vessel O
's O
side O
, O
so O
as O
firmly O
to O
embrace O
the O
jaw O
. O
Does O
not O
this O
whole O
head O
seem O
to O
speak O
of O
an O
enormous O
practical O
resolution O
in O
facing O
death O
? O
This O
Right O
Whale O
I O
take O
to O
have O
been O
a O
Stoic O
; O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
a O
Platonian O
, O
who O
might O
have O
taken O
up O
Spinoza O
in O
his O
latter O
years O
. O
