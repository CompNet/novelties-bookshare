When O
Stubb O
had O
departed O
, O
Ahab O
stood O
for O
a O
while O
leaning O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
; O
and O
then O
, O
as O
had O
been O
usual O
with O
him O
of O
late O
, O
calling O
a O
sailor O
of O
the O
watch O
, O
he O
sent O
him O
below O
for O
his O
ivory O
stool O
, O
and O
also O
his O
pipe O
. O
Lighting O
the O
pipe O
at O
the O
binnacle O
lamp O
and O
planting O
the O
stool O
on O
the O
weather O
side O
of O
the O
deck O
, O
he O
sat O
and O
smoked O
. O
In O
old O
Norse O
times O
, O
the O
thrones O
of O
the O
sea-loving O
Danish O
kings O
were O
fabricated O
, O
saith O
tradition O
, O
of O
the O
tusks O
of O
the O
narwhale O
. O
How O
could O
one O
look O
at O
Ahab O
then O
, O
seated O
on O
that O
tripod O
of O
bones O
, O
without O
bethinking O
him O
of O
the O
royalty O
it O
symbolized O
? O
For O
a O
Khan O
of O
the O
plank O
, O
and O
a O
king O
of O
the O
sea O
and O
a O
great O
lord O
of O
Leviathans O
was O
Ahab O
. O
Some O
moments O
passed O
, O
during O
which O
the O
thick O
vapor O
came O
from O
his O
mouth O
in O
quick O
and O
constant O
puffs O
, O
which O
blew O
back O
again O
into O
his O
face O
. O
" O
How O
now O
, O
" O
he O
soliloquized O
at O
last O
, O
withdrawing O
the O
tube O
, O
" O
this O
smoking O
no O
longer O
soothes O
. O
Oh O
, O
my O
pipe O
! O
hard O
must O
it O
go O
with O
me O
if O
thy O
charm O
be O
gone O
! O
Here O
have O
I O
been O
unconsciously O
toiling O
, O
not O
pleasuringâ€” O
aye O
, O
and O
ignorantly O
smoking O
to O
windward O
all O
the O
while O
; O
to O
windward O
, O
and O
with O
such O
nervous O
whiffs O
, O
as O
if O
, O
like O
the O
dying O
whale O
, O
my O
final O
jets O
were O
the O
strongest O
and O
fullest O
of O
trouble O
. O
What O
business O
have O
I O
with O
this O
pipe O
? O
This O
thing O
that O
is O
meant O
for O
sereneness O
, O
to O
send O
up O
mild O
white O
vapors O
among O
mild O
white O
hairs O
, O
not O
among O
torn O
iron-grey O
locks O
like O
mine O
. O
I O
'll O
smoke O
no O
more- O
" O
He O
tossed O
the O
still O
lighted O
pipe O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
The O
fire O
hissed O
in O
the O
waves O
; O
the O
same O
instant O
the O
ship O
shot O
by O
the O
bubble O
the O
sinking O
pipe O
made O
. O
With O
slouched O
hat O
, O
Ahab O
lurchingly O
paced O
the O
planks O
