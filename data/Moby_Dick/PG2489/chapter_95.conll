Had O
you O
stepped O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod O
at O
a O
certain O
juncture O
of O
this O
post-mortemizing O
of O
the O
whale O
; O
and O
had O
you O
strolled O
forward O
nigh O
the O
windlass O
, O
pretty O
sure O
am O
I O
that O
you O
would O
have O
scanned O
with O
no O
small O
curiosity O
a O
very O
strange O
, O
enigmatical O
object O
, O
which O
you O
would O
have O
seen O
there O
, O
lying O
along O
lengthwise O
in O
the O
lee O
scuppers O
. O
Not O
the O
wondrous O
cistern O
in O
the O
whale O
's O
huge O
head O
; O
not O
the O
prodigy O
of O
his O
unhinged O
lower O
jaw O
; O
not O
the O
miracle O
of O
his O
symmetrical O
tail O
; O
none O
of O
these O
would O
so O
surprise O
you O
, O
as O
half O
a O
glimpse O
of O
that O
unaccountable O
cone O
, O
â€”longer O
than O
a O
Kentuckian O
is O
tall O
, O
nigh O
a O
foot O
in O
diameter O
at O
the O
base O
, O
and O
jet-black O
as O
Yojo O
, O
the O
ebony O
idol O
of O
Queequeg O
. O
And O
an O
idol O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
is O
; O
or O
rather O
, O
in O
old O
times O
, O
its O
likeness O
was O
. O
Such O
an O
idol O
as O
that O
found O
in O
the O
secret O
groves O
of O
Queen O
Maachah O
in O
Judea O
; O
and O
for O
worshipping O
which O
, O
King O
Asa O
, O
her O
son O
, O
did O
depose O
her O
, O
and O
destroyed O
the O
idol O
, O
and O
burnt O
it O
for O
an O
abomination O
at O
the O
brook O
Kedron O
, O
as O
darkly O
set O
forth O
in O
the O
15th O
chapter O
of O
the O
First O
Book O
of O
Kings O
. O
Look O
at O
the O
sailor O
, O
called O
the O
mincer O
, O
who O
now O
comes O
along O
, O
and O
assisted O
by O
two O
allies O
, O
heavily O
backs O
the O
grandissimus O
, O
as O
the O
mariners O
call O
it O
, O
and O
with O
bowed O
shoulders O
, O
staggers O
off O
with O
it O
as O
if O
he O
were O
a O
grenadier O
carrying O
a O
dead O
comrade O
from O
the O
field O
. O
Extending O
it O
upon O
the O
forecastle O
deck O
, O
he O
now O
proceeds O
cylindrically O
to O
remove O
its O
dark O
pelt O
, O
as O
an O
African O
hunter O
the O
pelt O
of O
a O
boa O
. O
This O
done O
he O
turns O
the O
pelt O
inside O
out O
, O
like O
a O
pantaloon O
leg O
; O
gives O
it O
a O
good O
stretching O
, O
so O
as O
almost O
to O
double O
its O
diameter O
; O
and O
at O
last O
hangs O
it O
, O
well O
spread O
, O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
to O
dry O
. O
Ere O
long O
, O
it O
is O
taken O
down O
; O
when O
removing O
some O
three O
feet O
of O
it O
, O
towards O
the O
pointed O
extremity O
, O
and O
then O
cutting O
two O
slits O
for O
arm-holes O
at O
the O
other O
end O
, O
he O
lengthwise O
slips O
himself O
bodily O
into O
it O
. O
The O
mincer O
now O
stands O
before O
you O
invested O
in O
the O
full O
canonicals O
of O
his O
calling O
. O
Immemorial O
to O
all O
his O
order O
, O
this O
investiture O
alone O
will O
adequately O
protect O
him O
, O
while O
employed O
in O
the O
peculiar O
functions O
of O
his O
office O
. O
That O
office O
consists O
in O
mincing O
the O
horse-pieces O
of O
blubber O
for O
the O
pots O
; O
an O
operation O
which O
is O
conducted O
at O
a O
curious O
wooden O
horse O
, O
planted O
endwise O
against O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
with O
a O
capacious O
tub O
beneath O
it O
, O
into O
which O
the O
minced O
pieces O
drop O
, O
fast O
as O
the O
sheets O
from O
a O
rapt O
orator O
's O
desk O
. O
Arrayed O
in O
decent O
black O
; O
occupying O
a O
conspicuous O
pulpit O
; O
intent O
on O
bible O
leaves O
; O
what O
a O
candidate O
for O
an O
archbishopric O
, O
what O
a O
lad O
for O
a O
Pope O
were O
this O
mincer O
! O

Bible O

Bible O

This O
is O
the O
invariable O
cry O
from O
the O
mates O
to O
the O
mincer O
. O
It O
enjoins O
him O
to O
be O
careful O
, O
and O
cut O
his O
work O
into O
as O
thin O
slices O
as O
possible O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
by O
so O
doing O
the O
business O
of O
boiling O
out O
the O
oil O
is O
much O
accelerated O
, O
and O
its O
quantity O
considerably O
increased O
, O
besides O
perhaps O
improving O
it O
in O
quality O
. O
