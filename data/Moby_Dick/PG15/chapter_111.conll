When O
gliding O
by O
the O
Bashee O
isles O
we O
emerged O
at O
last O
upon O
the O
great O
South O
Sea O
; O
were O
it O
not O
for O
other O
things O
, O
I O
could O
have O
greeted O
my O
dear O
Pacific O
with O
uncounted O
thanks O
, O
for O
now O
the O
long O
supplication O
of O
my O
youth O
was O
answered O
; O
that O
serene O
ocean O
rolled O
eastwards O
from O
me O
a O
thousand O
leagues O
of O
blue O
. O
There O
is O
, O
one O
knows O
not O
what O
sweet O
mystery O
about O
this O
sea O
, O
whose O
gently O
awful O
stirrings O
seem O
to O
speak O
of O
some O
hidden O
soul O
beneath O
; O
like O
those O
fabled O
undulations O
of O
the O
Ephesian O
sod O
over O
the O
buried O
Evangelist O
St O
. O
John O
. O
And O
meet O
it O
is O
, O
that O
over O
these O
sea-pastures O
, O
wide-rolling O
watery O
prairies O
and O
Potters O
' O
Fields O
of O
all O
four O
continents O
, O
the O
waves O
should O
rise O
and O
fall O
, O
and O
ebb O
and O
flow O
unceasingly O
; O
for O
here O
, O
millions O
of O
mixed O
shades O
and O
shadows O
, O
drowned O
dreams O
, O
somnambulisms O
, O
reveries O
; O
all O
that O
we O
call O
lives O
and O
souls O
, O
lie O
dreaming O
, O
dreaming O
, O
still O
; O
tossing O
like O
slumberers O
in O
their O
beds O
; O
the O
ever-rolling O
waves O
but O
made O
so O
by O
their O
restlessness O
. O
To O
any O
meditative O
Magian O
rover O
, O
this O
serene O
Pacific O
, O
once O
beheld O
, O
must O
ever O
after O
be O
the O
sea O
of O
his O
adoption O
. O
It O
rolls O
the O
midmost O
waters O
of O
the O
world O
, O
the O
Indian O
ocean O
and O
Atlantic O
being O
but O
its O
arms O
. O
The O
same O
waves O
wash O
the O
moles O
of O
the O
new-built O
Californian O
towns O
, O
but O
yesterday O
planted O
by O
the O
recentest O
race O
of O
men O
, O
and O
lave O
the O
faded O
but O
still O
gorgeous O
skirts O
of O
Asiatic O
lands O
, O
older O
than O
Abraham O
; O
while O
all O
between O
float O
milky-ways O
of O
coral O
isles O
, O
and O
low-lying O
, O
endless O
, O
unknown O
Archipelagoes O
, O
and O
impenetrable O
Japans O
. O
Thus O
this O
mysterious O
, O
divine O
Pacific O
zones O
the O
world O
's O
whole O
bulk O
about O
; O
makes O
all O
coasts O
one O
bay O
to O
it O
; O
seems O
the O
tide-beating O
heart O
of O
earth O
. O
Lifted O
by O
those O
eternal O
swells O
, O
you O
needs O
must O
own O
the O
seductive O
god O
, O
bowing O
your O
head O
to O
Pan O
. O
But O
few O
thoughts O
of O
Pan O
stirred O
Ahab O
's O
brain O
, O
as O
standing O
like O
an O
iron O
statue O
at O
his O
accustomed O
place O
beside O
the O
mizen O
rigging O
, O
with O
one O
nostril O
he O
unthinkingly O
snuffed O
the O
sugary O
musk O
from O
the O
Bashee O
isles O
( O
in O
whose O
sweet O
woods O
mild O
lovers O
must O
be O
walking O
) O
, O
and O
with O
the O
other O
consciously O
inhaled O
the O
salt O
breath O
of O
the O
new O
found O
sea O
; O
that O
sea O
in O
which O
the O
hated O
White O
Whale O
must O
even O
then O
be O
swimming O
. O
Launched O
at O
length O
upon O
these O
almost O
final O
waters O
, O
and O
gliding O
towards O
the O
Japanese O
cruising-ground O
, O
the O
old O
man O
's O
purpose O
intensified O
itself O
. O
His O
firm O
lips O
met O
like O
the O
lips O
of O
a O
vice O
; O
the O
Delta O
of O
his O
forehead O
's O
veins O
swelled O
like O
overladen O
brooks O
; O
in O
his O
very O
sleep O
, O
his O
ringing O
cry O
ran O
through O
the O
vaulted O
hull O
, O
" O
Stern O
all O
! O
the O
White O
Whale O
spouts O
thick O
blood O
! O
