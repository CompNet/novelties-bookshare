The O
allusion O
to O
the O
waifs O
and O
waif-poles O
in O
the O
last O
chapter O
but O
one O
, O
necessitates O
some O
account O
of O
the O
laws O
and O
regulations O
of O
the O
whale O
fishery O
, O
of O
which O
the O
waif O
may O
be O
deemed O
the O
grand O
symbol O
and O
badge O
. O
It O
frequently O
happens O
that O
when O
several O
ships O
are O
cruising O
in O
company O
, O
a O
whale O
may O
be O
struck O
by O
one O
vessel O
, O
then O
escape O
, O
and O
be O
finally O
killed O
and O
captured O
by O
another O
vessel O
; O
and O
herein O
are O
indirectly O
comprised O
many O
minor O
contingencies O
, O
all O
partaking O
of O
this O
one O
grand O
feature O
. O
For O
example O
, O
—after O
a O
weary O
and O
perilous O
chase O
and O
capture O
of O
a O
whale O
, O
the O
body O
may O
get O
loose O
from O
the O
ship O
by O
reason O
of O
a O
violent O
storm O
; O
and O
drifting O
far O
away O
to O
leeward O
, O
be O
retaken O
by O
a O
second O
whaler O
, O
who O
, O
in O
a O
calm O
, O
snugly O
tows O
it O
alongside O
, O
without O
risk O
of O
life O
or O
line O
. O
Thus O
the O
most O
vexatious O
and O
violent O
disputes O
would O
often O
arise O
between O
the O
fishermen O
, O
were O
there O
not O
some O
written O
or O
unwritten O
, O
universal O
, O
undisputed O
law O
applicable O
to O
all O
cases O
. O
Perhaps O
the O
only O
formal O
whaling O
code O
authorized O
by O
legislative O
enactment O
, O
was O
that O
of O
Holland O
. O
It O
was O
decreed O
by O
the O
States-General O
in O
A. O
D. O
1695 O
. O
But O
though O
no O
other O
nation O
has O
ever O
had O
any O
written O
whaling O
law O
, O
yet O
the O
American O
fishermen O
have O
been O
their O
own O
legislators O
and O
lawyers O
in O
this O
matter O
. O
They O
have O
provided O
a O
system O
which O
for O
terse O
comprehensiveness O
surpasses O
Justinian O
's O
Pandects O
and O
the O
By-laws O
of O
the O
Chinese O
Society O
for O
the O
Suppression O
of O
Meddling O
with O
other O
People O
's O
Business O
. O
Yes O
; O
these O
laws O
might O
be O
engraven O
on O
a O
Queen O
Anne O
's O
farthing O
, O
or O
the O
barb O
of O
a O
harpoon O
, O
and O
worn O
round O
the O
neck O
, O
so O
small O
are O
they O
. O
I O
. O
A O
Fast-Fish O
belongs O
to O
the O
party O
fast O
to O
it O
. O
II O
. O
A O
Loose-Fish O
is O
fair O
game O
for O
anybody O
who O
can O
soonest O
catch O
it O
. O
But O
what O
plays O
the O
mischief O
with O
this O
masterly O
code O
is O
the O
admirable O
brevity O
of O
it O
, O
which O
necessitates O
a O
vast O
volume O
of O
commentaries O
to O
expound O
it O
. O
First O
: O
What O
is O
a O
Fast-Fish O
? O
Alive O
or O
dead O
a O
fish O
is O
technically O
fast O
, O
when O
it O
is O
connected O
with O
an O
occupied O
ship O
or O
boat O
, O
by O
any O
medium O
at O
all O
controllable O
by O
the O
occupant O
or O
occupants O
, O
—a O
mast O
, O
an O
oar O
, O
a O
nine-inch O
cable O
, O
a O
telegraph O
wire O
, O
or O
a O
strand O
of O
cobweb O
, O
it O
is O
all O
the O
same O
. O
Likewise O
a O
fish O
is O
technically O
fast O
when O
it O
bears O
a O
waif O
, O
or O
any O
other O
recognised O
symbol O
of O
possession O
; O
so O
long O
as O
the O
party O
waifing O
it O
plainly O
evince O
their O
ability O
at O
any O
time O
to O
take O
it O
alongside O
, O
as O
well O
as O
their O
intention O
so O
to O
do O
. O
These O
are O
scientific O
commentaries O
; O
but O
the O
commentaries O
of O
the O
whalemen O
themselves O
sometimes O
consist O
in O
hard O
words O
and O
harder O
knocks—the O
Coke-upon-Littleton O
of O
the O
fist O
. O
True O
, O
among O
the O
more O
upright O
and O
honorable O
whalemen O
allowances O
are O
always O
made O
for O
peculiar O
cases O
, O
where O
it O
would O
be O
an O
outrageous O
moral O
injustice O
for O
one O
party O
to O
claim O
possession O
of O
a O
whale O
previously O
chased O
or O
killed O
by O
another O
party O
. O
But O
others O
are O
by O
no O
means O
so O
scrupulous O
. O
Some O
fifty O
years O
ago O
there O
was O
a O
curious O
case O
of O
whale-trover O
litigated O
in O
England O
, O
wherein O
the O
plaintiffs O
set O
forth O
that O
after O
a O
hard O
chase O
of O
a O
whale O
in O
the O
Northern O
seas O
; O
and O
when O
indeed O
they O
( O
the O
plaintiffs O
) O
had O
succeeded O
in O
harpooning O
the O
fish O
; O
they O
were O
at O
last O
, O
through O
peril O
of O
their O
lives O
, O
obliged O
to O
forsake O
not O
only O
their O
lines O
, O
but O
their O
boat O
itself O
. O
Ultimately O
the O
defendants O
( O
the O
crew O
of O
another O
ship O
) O
came O
up O
with O
the O
whale O
, O
struck O
, O
killed O
, O
seized O
, O
and O
finally O
appropriated O
it O
before O
the O
very O
eyes O
of O
the O
plaintiffs O
. O
And O
when O
those O
defendants O
were O
remonstrated O
with O
, O
their O
captain O
snapped O
his O
fingers O
in O
the O
plaintiffs O
' O
teeth O
, O
and O
assured O
them O
that O
by O
way O
of O
doxology O
to O
the O
deed O
he O
had O
done O
, O
he O
would O
now O
retain O
their O
line O
, O
harpoons O
, O
and O
boat O
, O
which O
had O
remained O
attached O
to O
the O
whale O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
seizure O
. O
Wherefore O
the O
plaintiffs O
now O
sued O
for O
the O
recovery O
of O
the O
value O
of O
their O
whale O
, O
line O
, O
harpoons O
, O
and O
boat O
. O
Mr. O
Erskine O
was O
counsel O
for O
the O
defendants O
; O
Lord O
Ellenborough O
was O
the O
judge O
. O
In O
the O
course O
of O
the O
defence O
, O
the O
witty O
Erskine O
went O
on O
to O
illustrate O
his O
position O
, O
by O
alluding O
to O
a O
recent O
crim O
. O
con O
. O
case O
, O
wherein O
a O
gentleman O
, O
after O
in O
vain O
trying O
to O
bridle O
his O
wife O
's O
viciousness O
, O
had O
at O
last O
abandoned O
her O
upon O
the O
seas O
of O
life O
; O
but O
in O
the O
course O
of O
years O
, O
repenting O
of O
that O
step O
, O
he O
instituted O
an O
action O
to O
recover O
possession O
of O
her O
. O
Erskine O
was O
on O
the O
other O
side O
; O
and O
he O
then O
supported O
it O
by O
saying O
, O
that O
though O
the O
gentleman O
had O
originally O
harpooned O
the O
lady O
, O
and O
had O
once O
had O
her O
fast O
, O
and O
only O
by O
reason O
of O
the O
great O
stress O
of O
her O
plunging O
viciousness O
, O
had O
at O
last O
abandoned O
her O
; O
yet O
abandon O
her O
he O
did O
, O
so O
that O
she O
became O
a O
loose-fish O
; O
and O
therefore O
when O
a O
subsequent O
gentleman O
re-harpooned O
her O
, O
the O
lady O
then O
became O
that O
subsequent O
gentleman O
's O
property O
, O
along O
with O
whatever O
harpoon O
might O
have O
been O
found O
sticking O
in O
her O
. O
Now O
in O
the O
present O
case O
Erskine O
contended O
that O
the O
examples O
of O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
lady O
were O
reciprocally O
illustrative O
of O
each O
other O
. O
These O
pleadings O
, O
and O
the O
counter O
pleadings O
, O
being O
duly O
heard O
, O
the O
very O
learned O
judge O
in O
set O
terms O
decided O
, O
to O
wit O
, O
—That O
as O
for O
the O
boat O
, O
he O
awarded O
it O
to O
the O
plaintiffs O
, O
because O
they O
had O
merely O
abandoned O
it O
to O
save O
their O
lives O
; O
but O
that O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
controverted O
whale O
, O
harpoons O
, O
and O
line O
, O
they O
belonged O
to O
the O
defendants O
; O
the O
whale O
, O
because O
it O
was O
a O
Loose-Fish O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
final O
capture O
; O
and O
the O
harpoons O
and O
line O
because O
when O
the O
fish O
made O
off O
with O
them O
, O
it O
( O
the O
fish O
) O
acquired O
a O
property O
in O
those O
articles O
; O
and O
hence O
anybody O
who O
afterwards O
took O
the O
fish O
had O
a O
right O
to O
them O
. O
Now O
the O
defendants O
afterwards O
took O
the O
fish O
; O
ergo O
, O
the O
aforesaid O
articles O
were O
theirs O
. O
A O
common O
man O
looking O
at O
this O
decision O
of O
the O
very O
learned O
Judge O
, O
might O
possibly O
object O
to O
it O
. O
But O
ploughed O
up O
to O
the O
primary O
rock O
of O
the O
matter O
, O
the O
two O
great O
principles O
laid O
down O
in O
the O
twin O
whaling O
laws O
previously O
quoted O
, O
and O
applied O
and O
elucidated O
by O
Lord O
Ellenborough O
in O
the O
above O
cited O
case O
; O
these O
two O
laws O
touching O
Fast-Fish O
and O
Loose-Fish O
, O
I O
say O
, O
will O
, O
on O
reflection O
, O
be O
found O
the O
fundamentals O
of O
all O
human O
jurisprudence O
; O
for O
notwithstanding O
its O
complicated O
tracery O
of O
sculpture O
, O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Law O
, O
like O
the O
Temple O
of O
the O
Philistines O
, O
has O
but O
two O
props O
to O
stand O
on O
. O
Is O
it O
not O
a O
saying O
in O
every O
one O
's O
mouth O
, O
Possession O
is O
half O
of O
the O
law O
: O
that O
is O
, O
regardless O
of O
how O
the O
thing O
came O
into O
possession O
? O
But O
often O
possession O
is O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
law O
. O
What O
are O
the O
sinews O
and O
souls O
of O
Russian O
serfs O
and O
Republican O
slaves O
but O
Fast-Fish O
, O
whereof O
possession O
is O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
law O
? O
What O
to O
the O
rapacious O
landlord O
is O
the O
widow O
's O
last O
mite O
but O
a O
Fast-Fish O
? O
What O
is O
yonder O
undetected O
villain O
's O
marble O
mansion O
with O
a O
door-plate O
for O
a O
waif O
; O
what O
is O
that O
but O
a O
Fast-Fish O
? O
What O
is O
the O
ruinous O
discount O
which O
Mordecai O
, O
the O
broker O
, O
gets O
from O
poor O
Woebegone O
, O
the O
bankrupt O
, O
on O
a O
loan O
to O
keep O
Woebegone O
's O
family O
from O
starvation O
; O
what O
is O
that O
ruinous O
discount O
but O
a O
Fast-Fish O
? O
What O
is O
the O
Archbishop O
of O
Savesoul O
's O
income O
of O
£100,000 O
seized O
from O

what O
is O
that O

What O

the O
Duke O

? O
And O
concerning O
all O
these O
, O
is O
not O
Possession O
the O
whole O
of O

law O
? O
But O
if O
the O
doctrine O
of O
Fast-Fish O

pretty O
generally O
applicable O

the O
kindred O
doctrine O

Loose-Fish O

still O
more O
widely O
