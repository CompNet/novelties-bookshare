I O
quickly O
followed O
suit O
, O
and O
descending O
into O
the O
bar-room O
accosted O
the O
grinning O
landlord O
very O
pleasantly O
. O
I O
cherished O
no O
malice O
towards O
him O
, O
though O
he O
had O
been O
skylarking O
with O
me O
not O
a O
little O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
my O
bedfellow O
. O
However O
, O
a O
good O
laugh O
is O
a O
mighty O
good O
thing O
, O
and O
rather O
too O
scarce O
a O
good O
thing O
; O
the O
more O
's O
the O
pity O
. O
So O
, O
if O
any O
one O
man O
, O
in O
his O
own O
proper O
person O
, O
afford O
stuff O
for O
a O
good O
joke O
to O
anybody O
, O
let O
him O
not O
be O
backward O
, O
but O
let O
him O
cheerfully O
allow O
himself O
to O
spend O
and O
be O
spent O
in O
that O
way O
. O
And O
the O
man O
that O
has O
anything O
bountifully O
laughable O
about O
him O
, O
be O
sure O
there O
is O
more O
in O
that O
man O
than O
you O
perhaps O
think O
for O
. O
The O
bar-room O
was O
now O
full O
of O
the O
boarders O
who O
had O
been O
dropping O
in O
the O
night O
previous O
, O
and O
whom O
I O
had O
not O
as O
yet O
had O
a O
good O
look O
at O
. O
They O
were O
nearly O
all O
whalemen O
; O
chief O
mates O
, O
and O
second O
mates O
, O
and O
third O
mates O
, O
and O
sea O
carpenters O
, O
and O
sea O
coopers O
, O
and O
sea O
blacksmiths O
, O
and O
harpooneers O
, O
and O
ship O
keepers O
; O
a O
brown O
and O
brawny O
company O
, O
with O
bosky O
beards O
; O
an O
unshorn O
, O
shaggy O
set O
, O
all O
wearing O
monkey O
jackets O
for O
morning O
gowns O
. O
You O
could O
pretty O
plainly O
tell O
how O
long O
each O
one O
had O
been O
ashore O
. O
This O
young O
fellow O
's O
healthy O
cheek O
is O
like O
a O
sun-toasted O
pear O
in O
hue O
, O
and O
would O
seem O
to O
smell O
almost O
as O
musky O
; O
he O
can O
not O
have O
been O
three O
days O
landed O
from O
his O
Indian O
voyage O
. O
That O
man O
next O
him O
looks O
a O
few O
shades O
lighter O
; O
you O
might O
say O
a O
touch O
of O
satin O
wood O
is O
in O
him O
. O
In O
the O
complexion O
of O
a O
third O
still O
lingers O
a O
tropic O
tawn O
, O
but O
slightly O
bleached O
withal O
; O
he O
doubtless O
has O
tarried O
whole O
weeks O
ashore O
. O
But O
who O
could O
show O
a O
cheek O
like O
Queequeg O
? O
which O
, O
barred O
with O
various O
tints O
, O
seemed O
like O
the O
Andes O
' O
western O
slope O
, O
to O
show O
forth O
in O
one O
array O
, O
contrasting O
climates O
, O
zone O
by O
zone O
. O
" O
Grub O
, O
ho O
! O
" O
now O
cried O
the O
landlord O
, O
flinging O
open O
a O
door O
, O
and O
in O
we O
went O
to O
breakfast O
. O
They O
say O
that O
men O
who O
have O
seen O
the O
world O
, O
thereby O
become O
quite O
at O
ease O
in O
manner O
, O
quite O
self-possessed O
in O
company O
. O
Not O
always O
, O
though O
: O
Ledyard O
, O
the O
great O
New O
England O
traveller O
, O
and O
Mungo O
Park O
, O
the O
Scotch O
one O
; O
of O
all O
men O
, O
they O
possessed O
the O
least O
assurance O
in O
the O
parlor O
. O
But O
perhaps O
the O
mere O
crossing O
of O
Siberia O
in O
a O
sledge O
drawn O
by O
dogs O
as O
Ledyard O
did O
, O
or O
the O
taking O
a O
long O
solitary O
walk O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
, O
in O
the O
negro O
heart O
of O
Africa O
, O
which O
was O
the O
sum O
of O
poor O
Mungo O
's O
performances—this O
kind O
of O
travel O
, O
I O
say O
, O
may O
not O
be O
the O
very O
best O
mode O
of O
attaining O
a O
high O
social O
polish O
. O
Still O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
is O
to O
be O
had O
anywhere O
. O
These O
reflections O
just O
here O
are O
occasioned O
by O
the O
circumstance O
that O
after O
we O
were O
all O
seated O
at O
the O
table O
, O
and O
I O
was O
preparing O
to O
hear O
some O
good O
stories O
about O
whaling O
; O
to O
my O
no O
small O
surprise O
, O
nearly O
every O
man O
maintained O
a O
profound O
silence O
. O
And O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
they O
looked O
embarrassed O
. O
Yes O
, O
here O
were O
a O
set O
of O
sea-dogs O
, O
many O
of O
whom O
without O
the O
slightest O
bashfulness O
had O
boarded O
great O
whales O
on O
the O
high O
seas—entire O
strangers O
to O
them—and O
duelled O
them O
dead O
without O
winking O
; O
and O
yet O
, O
here O
they O
sat O
at O
a O
social O
breakfast O
table—all O
of O
the O
same O
calling O
, O
all O
of O
kindred O
tastes—looking O
round O
as O
sheepishly O
at O
each O
other O
as O
though O
they O
had O
never O
been O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
some O
sheepfold O
among O
the O
Green O
Mountains O
. O
A O
curious O
sight O
; O
these O
bashful O
bears O
, O
these O
timid O
warrior O
whalemen O
! O
But O
as O
for O
Queequeg—why O
, O
Queequeg O
sat O
there O
among O
them—at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
table O
, O
too O
, O
it O
so O
chanced O
; O
as O
cool O
as O
an O
icicle O
. O
To O
be O
sure O
I O
can O
not O
say O
much O
for O
his O
breeding O
. O
His O
greatest O
admirer O
could O
not O
have O
cordially O
justified O
his O
bringing O
his O
harpoon O
into O
breakfast O
with O
him O
, O
and O
using O
it O
there O
without O
ceremony O
; O
reaching O
over O
the O
table O
with O
it O
, O
to O
the O
imminent O
jeopardy O
of O
many O
heads O
, O
and O
grappling O
the O
beefsteaks O
towards O
him O
. O
But O
_that_ O
was O
certainly O
very O
coolly O
done O
by O
him O
, O
and O
every O
one O
knows O
that O
in O
most O
people O
's O
estimation O
, O
to O
do O
anything O
coolly O
is O
to O
do O
it O
genteelly O
. O
We O
will O
not O
speak O
of O
all O
Queequeg O
's O
peculiarities O
here O
; O
how O
he O
eschewed O
coffee O
and O
hot O
rolls O
, O
and O
applied O
his O
undivided O
attention O
to O
beefsteaks O
, O
done O
rare O
. O
Enough O
, O
that O
when O
breakfast O
was O
over O
he O
withdrew O
like O
the O
rest O
into O
the O
public O
room O
, O
lighted O
his O
tomahawk-pipe O
, O
and O
was O
sitting O
there O
quietly O
digesting O
and O
smoking O
with O
his O
inseparable O
hat O
on O
, O
when O
I O
sallied O
out O
for O
a O
stroll O
. O
