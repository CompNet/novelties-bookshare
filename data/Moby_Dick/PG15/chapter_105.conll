Inasmuch O
, O
then O
, O
as O
this O
Leviathan O
comes O
floundering O
down O
upon O
us O
from O
the O
head-waters O
of O
the O
Eternities O
, O
it O
may O
be O
fitly O
inquired O
, O
whether O
, O
in O
the O
long O
course O
of O
his O
generations O
, O
he O
has O
not O
degenerated O
from O
the O
original O
bulk O
of O
his O
sires O
. O
But O
upon O
investigation O
we O
find O
, O
that O
not O
only O
are O
the O
whales O
of O
the O
present O
day O
superior O
in O
magnitude O
to O
those O
whose O
fossil O
remains O
are O
found O
in O
the O
Tertiary O
system O
( O
embracing O
a O
distinct O
geological O
period O
prior O
to O
man O
) O
, O
but O
of O
the O
whales O
found O
in O
that O
Tertiary O
system O
, O
those O
belonging O
to O
its O
latter O
formations O
exceed O
in O
size O
those O
of O
its O
earlier O
ones O
. O
Of O
all O
the O
pre-adamite O
whales O
yet O
exhumed O
, O
by O
far O
the O
largest O
is O
the O
Alabama O
one O
mentioned O
in O
the O
last O
chapter O
, O
and O
that O
was O
less O
than O
seventy O
feet O
in O
length O
in O
the O
skeleton O
. O
Whereas O
, O
we O
have O
already O
seen O
, O
that O
the O
tape-measure O
gives O
seventy-two O
feet O
for O
the O
skeleton O
of O
a O
large O
sized O
modern O
whale O
. O
And O
I O
have O
heard O
, O
on O
whalemen O
's O
authority O
, O
that O
Sperm O
Whales O
have O
been O
captured O
near O
a O
hundred O
feet O
long O
at O
the O
time O
of O
capture O
. O
But O
may O
it O
not O
be O
, O
that O
while O
the O
whales O
of O
the O
present O
hour O
are O
an O
advance O
in O
magnitude O
upon O
those O
of O
all O
previous O
geological O
periods O
; O
may O
it O
not O
be O
, O
that O
since O
Adam O
's O
time O
they O
have O
degenerated O
? O
Assuredly O
, O
we O
must O
conclude O
so O
, O
if O
we O
are O
to O
credit O
the O
accounts O
of O
such O
gentlemen O
as O
Pliny O
, O
and O
the O
ancient O
naturalists O
generally O
. O
For O
Pliny O
tells O
us O
of O
whales O
that O
embraced O
acres O
of O
living O
bulk O
, O
and O
Aldrovandus O
of O
others O
which O
measured O
eight O
hundred O
feet O
in O
length—Rope O
Walks O
and O
Thames O
Tunnels O
of O
Whales O
! O
And O
even O
in O
the O
days O
of O
Banks O
and O
Solander O
, O
Cooke O
's O
naturalists O
, O
we O
find O
a O
Danish O
member O
of O
the O
Academy O
of O
Sciences O
setting O
down O
certain O
Iceland O
Whales O
( O
reydan-siskur O
, O
or O
Wrinkled O
Bellies O
) O
at O
one O
hundred O
and O
twenty O
yards O
; O
that O
is O
, O
three O
hundred O
and O
sixty O
feet O
. O
And O
Lacépède O
, O
the O
French O
naturalist O
, O
in O
his O
elaborate O
history O
of O
whales O
, O
in O
the O
very O
beginning O
of O
his O
work O
( O
page O
3 O
) O
, O
sets O
down O
the O
Right O
Whale O
at O
one O
hundred O
metres O
, O
three O
hundred O
and O
twenty-eight O
feet O
. O
And O
this O
work O
was O
published O
so O
late O
as O
A. O
D. O
1825 O
. O
But O
will O
any O
whaleman O
believe O
these O
stories O
? O
No O
. O
The O
whale O
of O
to-day O
is O
as O
big O
as O
his O
ancestors O
in O
Pliny O
's O
time O
. O
And O
if O
ever O
I O
go O
where O
Pliny O
is O
, O
I O
, O
a O
whaleman O
( O
more O
than O
he O
was O
) O
, O
will O
make O
bold O
to O
tell O
him O
so O
. O
Because O
I O
can O
not O
understand O
how O
it O
is O
, O
that O
while O
the O
Egyptian O
mummies O
that O
were O
buried O
thousands O
of O
years O
before O
even O
Pliny O
was O
born O
, O
do O
not O
measure O
so O
much O
in O
their O
coffins O
as O
a O
modern O
Kentuckian O
in O
his O
socks O
; O
and O
while O
the O
cattle O
and O
other O
animals O
sculptured O
on O
the O
oldest O
Egyptian O
and O
Nineveh O
tablets O
, O
by O
the O
relative O
proportions O
in O
which O
they O
are O
drawn O
, O
just O
as O
plainly O
prove O
that O
the O
high-bred O
, O
stall-fed O
, O
prize O
cattle O
of O
Smithfield O
, O
not O
only O
equal O
, O
but O
far O
exceed O
in O
magnitude O
the O
fattest O
of O
Pharaoh O
's O
fat O
kine O
; O
in O
the O
face O
of O
all O
this O
, O
I O
will O
not O
admit O
that O
of O
all O
animals O
the O
whale O
alone O
should O
have O
degenerated O
. O
But O
still O
another O
inquiry O
remains O
; O
one O
often O
agitated O
by O
the O
more O
recondite O
Nantucketers O
. O
Whether O
owing O
to O
the O
almost O
omniscient O
look-outs O
at O
the O
mast-heads O
of O
the O
whale-ships O
, O
now O
penetrating O
even O
through O
Behring O
's O
straits O
, O
and O
into O
the O
remotest O
secret O
drawers O
and O
lockers O
of O
the O
world O
; O
and O
the O
thousand O
harpoons O
and O
lances O
darted O
along O
all O
continental O
coasts O
; O
the O
moot O
point O
is O
, O
whether O
Leviathan O
can O
long O
endure O
so O
wide O
a O
chase O
, O
and O
so O
remorseless O
a O
havoc O
; O
whether O
he O
must O
not O
at O
last O
be O
exterminated O
from O
the O
waters O
, O
and O
the O
last O
whale O
, O
like O
the O
last O
man O
, O
smoke O
his O
last O
pipe O
, O
and O
then O
himself O
evaporate O
in O
the O
final O
puff O
. O
Comparing O
the O
humped O
herds O
of O
whales O
with O
the O
humped O
herds O
of O
buffalo O
, O
which O
, O
not O
forty O
years O
ago O
, O
overspread O
by O
tens O
of O
thousands O
the O
prairies O
of O
Illinois O
and O
Missouri O
, O
and O
shook O
their O
iron O
manes O
and O
scowled O
with O
their O
thunder-clotted O
brows O
upon O
the O
sites O
of O
populous O
river-capitals O
, O
where O
now O
the O
polite O
broker O
sells O
you O
land O
at O
a O
dollar O
an O
inch O
; O
in O
such O
a O
comparison O
an O
irresistible O
argument O
would O
seem O
furnished O
, O
to O
show O
that O
the O
hunted O
whale O
can O
not O
now O
escape O
speedy O
extinction O
. O
But O
you O
must O
look O
at O
this O
matter O
in O
every O
light O
. O
Though O
so O
short O
a O
period O
ago—not O
a O
good O
life-time—the O
census O
of O
the O
buffalo O
in O
Illinois O
exceeded O
the O
census O
of O
men O
now O
in O
London O
, O
and O
though O
at O
the O
present O
day O
not O
one O
horn O
or O
hoof O
of O
them O
remains O
in O
all O
that O
region O
; O
and O
though O
the O
cause O
of O
this O
wondrous O
extermination O
was O
the O
spear O
of O
man O
; O
yet O
the O
far O
different O
nature O
of O
the O
whale-hunt O
peremptorily O
forbids O
so O
inglorious O
an O
end O
to O
the O
Leviathan O
. O
Forty O
men O
in O
one O
ship O
hunting O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
for O
forty-eight O
months O
think O
they O
have O
done O
extremely O
well O
, O
and O
thank O
God O
, O
if O
at O
last O
they O
carry O
home O
the O
oil O
of O
forty O
fish O
. O
Whereas O
, O
in O
the O
days O
of O
the O
old O
Canadian O
and O
Indian O
hunters O
and O
trappers O
of O
the O
West O
, O
when O
the O
far O
west O
( O
in O
whose O
sunset O
suns O
still O
rise O
) O
was O
a O
wilderness O
and O
a O
virgin O
, O
the O
same O
number O
of O
moccasined O
men O
, O
for O
the O
same O
number O
of O
months O
, O
mounted O
on O
horse O
instead O
of O
sailing O
in O
ships O
, O
would O
have O
slain O
not O
forty O
, O
but O
forty O
thousand O
and O
more O
buffaloes O
; O
a O
fact O
that O
, O
if O
need O
were O
, O
could O
be O
statistically O
stated O
. O
Nor O
, O
considered O
aright O
, O
does O
it O
seem O
any O
argument O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
gradual O
extinction O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
for O
example O
, O
that O
in O
former O
years O
( O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
the O
last O
century O
, O
say O
) O
these O
Leviathans O
, O
in O
small O
pods O
, O
were O
encountered O
much O
oftener O
than O
at O
present O
, O
and O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
the O
voyages O
were O
not O
so O
prolonged O
, O
and O
were O
also O
much O
more O
remunerative O
. O
Because O
, O
as O
has O
been O
elsewhere O
noticed O
, O
those O
whales O
, O
influenced O
by O
some O
views O
to O
safety O
, O
now O
swim O
the O
seas O
in O
immense O
caravans O
, O
so O
that O
to O
a O
large O
degree O
the O
scattered O
solitaries O
, O
yokes O
, O
and O
pods O
, O
and O
schools O
of O
other O
days O
are O
now O
aggregated O
into O
vast O
but O
widely O
separated O
, O
unfrequent O
armies O
. O
That O
is O
all O
. O
And O
equally O
fallacious O
seems O
the O
conceit O
, O
that O
because O
the O
so-called O
whale-bone O
whales O
no O
longer O
haunt O
many O
grounds O
in O
former O
years O
abounding O
with O
them O
, O
hence O
that O
species O
also O
is O
declining O
. O
For O
they O
are O
only O
being O
driven O
from O
promontory O
to O
cape O
; O
and O
if O
one O
coast O
is O
no O
longer O
enlivened O
with O
their O
jets O
, O
then O
, O
be O
sure O
, O
some O
other O
and O
remoter O
strand O
has O
been O
very O
recently O
startled O
by O
the O
unfamiliar O
spectacle O
. O
Furthermore O
: O
concerning O
these O
last O
mentioned O
Leviathans O
, O
they O
have O
two O
firm O
fortresses O
, O
which O
, O
in O
all O
human O
probability O
, O
will O
for O
ever O
remain O
impregnable O
. O
And O
as O
upon O
the O
invasion O
of O
their O
valleys O
, O
the O
frosty O
Swiss O
have O
retreated O
to O
their O
mountains O
; O
so O
, O
hunted O
from O
the O
savannas O
and O
glades O
of O
the O
middle O
seas O
, O
the O
whale-bone O
whales O
can O
at O
last O
resort O
to O
their O
Polar O
citadels O
, O
and O
diving O
under O
the O
ultimate O
glassy O
barriers O
and O
walls O
there O
, O
come O
up O
among O
icy O
fields O
and O
floes O
; O
and O
in O
a O
charmed O
circle O
of O
everlasting O
December O
, O
bid O
defiance O
to O
all O
pursuit O
from O
man O
. O
But O
as O
perhaps O
fifty O
of O
these O
whale-bone O
whales O
are O
harpooned O
for O
one O
cachalot O
, O
some O
philosophers O
of O
the O
forecastle O
have O
concluded O
that O
this O
positive O
havoc O
has O
already O
very O
seriously O
diminished O
their O
battalions O
. O
But O
though O
for O
some O
time O
past O
a O
number O
of O
these O
whales O
, O
not O
less O
than O
13,000 O
, O
have O
been O
annually O
slain O
on O
the O
nor O
' O
west O
coast O
by O
the O
Americans O
alone O
; O
yet O
there O
are O
considerations O
which O
render O
even O
this O
circumstance O
of O
little O
or O
no O
account O
as O
an O
opposing O
argument O
in O
this O
matter O
. O
Natural O
as O
it O
is O
to O
be O
somewhat O
incredulous O
concerning O
the O
populousness O
of O
the O
more O
enormous O
creatures O
of O
the O
globe O
, O
yet O
what O
shall O
we O
say O
to O
Harto O
, O
the O
historian O
of O
Goa O
, O
when O
he O
tells O
us O
that O
at O
one O
hunting O
the O
King O
of O
Siam O
took O
4000 O
elephants O
; O
that O
in O
those O
regions O
elephants O
are O
numerous O
as O
droves O
of O
cattle O
in O
the O
temperate O
climes O
. O
And O
there O
seems O
no O
reason O
to O
doubt O
that O
if O
these O
elephants O
, O
which O
have O
now O
been O
hunted O
for O
thousands O
of O
years O
, O
by O
Semiramis O
, O
by O
Porus O
, O
by O
Hannibal O
, O
and O
by O
all O
the O
successive O
monarchs O
of O
the O
East—if O
they O
still O
survive O
there O
in O
great O
numbers O
, O
much O
more O
may O
the O
great O
whale O
outlast O
all O
hunting O
, O
since O
he O
has O
a O
pasture O
to O
expatiate O
in O
, O
which O
is O
precisely O
twice O
as O
large O
as O
all O
Asia O
, O
both O
Americas O
, O
Europe O
and O
Africa O
, O
New O
Holland O
, O
and O
all O
the O
Isles O
of O
the O
sea O
combined O
. O
Moreover O
: O
we O
are O
to O
consider O
, O
that O
from O
the O
presumed O
great O
longevity O
of O
whales O
, O
their O
probably O
attaining O
the O
age O
of O
a O
century O
and O
more O
, O
therefore O
at O
any O
one O
period O
of O
time O
, O
several O
distinct O
adult O
generations O
must O
be O
contemporary O
. O
And O
what O
that O
is O
, O
we O
may O
soon O
gain O
some O
idea O
of O
, O
by O
imagining O
all O
the O
grave-yards O
, O
cemeteries O
, O
and O
family O
vaults O
of O
creation O
yielding O
up O
the O
live O
bodies O
of O
all O
the O
men O
, O
women O
, O
and O
children O
who O
were O
alive O
seventy-five O
years O
ago O
; O
and O
adding O
this O
countless O
host O
to O
the O
present O
human O
population O
of O
the O
globe O
. O
Wherefore O
, O
for O
all O
these O
things O
, O
we O
account O
the O
whale O
immortal O
in O
his O
species O
, O
however O
perishable O
in O
his O
individuality O
. O
He O
swam O
the O
seas O
before O
the O
continents O
broke O
water O
; O
he O
once O
swam O
over O
the O
site O
of O
the O
Tuileries O
, O
and O
Windsor O
Castle O
, O
and O
the O
Kremlin O
. O
In O
Noah O
's O
flood O
he O
despised O
Noah O
's O
Ark O
; O
and O
if O
ever O
the O
world O
is O
to O
be O
again O
flooded O
, O
like O
the O
Netherlands O
, O
to O
kill O
off O
its O
rats O
, O
then O
the O
eternal O
whale O
will O
still O
survive O
, O
and O
rearing O
upon O
the O
topmost O
crest O
of O
the O
equatorial O
flood O
, O
spout O
his O
frothed O
defiance O
to O
the O
skies O
. O
