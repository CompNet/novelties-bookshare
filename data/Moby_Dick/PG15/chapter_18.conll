As O
we O
were O
walking O
down O
the O
end O
of O
the O
wharf O
towards O
the O
ship O
, O
Queequeg O
carrying O
his O
harpoon O
, O
Captain O
Peleg O
in O
his O
gruff O
voice O
loudly O
hailed O
us O
from O
his O
wigwam O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
not O
suspected O
my O
friend O
was O
a O
cannibal O
, O
and O
furthermore O
announcing O
that O
he O
let O
no O
cannibals O
on O
board O
that O
craft O
, O
unless O
they O
previously O
produced O
their O
papers O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
, O
Captain O
Peleg O
? O
" O
said O
I O
, O
now O
jumping O
on O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
leaving O
my O
comrade O
standing O
on O
the O
wharf O
. O
" O
I O
mean O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
he O
must O
show O
his O
papers O
. O
" O
" O
Yea O
, O
" O
said O
Captain O
Bildad O
in O
his O
hollow O
voice O
, O
sticking O
his O
head O
from O
behind O
Peleg O
's O
, O
out O
of O
the O
wigwam O
. O
" O
He O
must O
show O
that O
he O
's O
converted O
. O
Son O
of O
darkness O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
turning O
to O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
art O
thou O
at O
present O
in O
communion O
with O
any O
christian O
church O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
he O
's O
a O
member O
of O
the O
first O
Congregational O
Church O
. O
" O
Here O
be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
many O
tattooed O
savages O
sailing O
in O
Nantucket O
ships O
at O
last O
come O
to O
be O
converted O
into O
the O
churches O
. O
" O
First O
Congregational O
Church O
, O
" O
cried O
Bildad O
, O
" O
what O
! O
that O
worships O
in O
Deacon O
Deuteronomy O
Coleman O
's O
meeting-house O
? O
" O
and O
so O
saying O
, O
taking O
out O
his O
spectacles O
, O
he O
rubbed O
them O
with O
his O
great O
yellow O
bandana O
handkerchief O
, O
and O
putting O
them O
on O
very O
carefully O
, O
came O
out O
of O
the O
wigwam O
, O
and O
leaning O
stiffly O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
took O
a O
good O
long O
look O
at O
Queequeg O
. O
" O
How O
long O
hath O
he O
been O
a O
member O
? O
" O
he O
then O
said O
, O
turning O
to O
me O
; O
" O
not O
very O
long O
, O
I O
rather O
guess O
, O
young O
man O
. O
" O
" O
No O
, O
" O
said O
Peleg O
, O
" O
and O
he O
has O
n't O
been O
baptized O
right O
either O
, O
or O
it O
would O
have O
washed O
some O
of O
that O
devil O
's O
blue O
off O
his O
face O
. O
" O
" O
Do O
tell O
, O
now O
, O
" O
cried O
Bildad O
, O
" O
is O
this O
Philistine O
a O
regular O
member O
of O
Deacon O
Deuteronomy O
's O
meeting O
? O
I O
never O
saw O
him O
going O
there O
, O
and O
I O
pass O
it O
every O
Lord O
's O
day O
. O
" O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
about O
Deacon O
Deuteronomy O
or O
his O
meeting O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
all O
I O
know O
is O
, O
that O
Queequeg O
here O
is O
a O
born O
member O
of O
the O
First O
Congregational O
Church O
. O
He O
is O
a O
deacon O
himself O
, O
Queequeg O
is O
. O
" O
" O
Young O
man O
, O
" O
said O
Bildad O
sternly O
, O
" O
thou O
art O
skylarking O
with O
me—explain O
thyself O
, O
thou O
young O
Hittite O
. O
What O
church O
dost O
thee O
mean O
? O
answer O
me O
. O
" O
Finding O
myself O
thus O
hard O
pushed O
, O
I O
replied O
. O
" O
I O
mean O
, O
sir O
, O
the O
same O
ancient O
Catholic O
Church O
to O
which O
you O
and O
I O
, O
and O
Captain O
Peleg O
there O
, O
and O
Queequeg O
here O
, O
and O
all O
of O
us O
, O
and O
every O
mother O
's O
son O
and O
soul O
of O
us O
belong O
; O
the O
great O
and O
everlasting O
First O
Congregation O
of O
this O
whole O
worshipping O
world O
; O
we O
all O
belong O
to O
that O
; O
only O
some O
of O
us O
cherish O
some O
queer O
crotchets O
noways O
touching O
the O
grand O
belief O
; O
in O
_that_ O
we O
all O
join O
hands O
. O
" O
" O
Splice O
, O
thou O
mean'st O
_splice_ O
hands O
, O
" O
cried O
Peleg O
, O
drawing O
nearer O
. O
" O
Young O
man O
, O
you O
'd O
better O
ship O
for O
a O
missionary O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
fore-mast O
hand O
; O
I O
never O
heard O
a O
better O
sermon O
. O
Deacon O
Deuteronomy—why O
Father O
Mapple O
himself O
could O
n't O
beat O
it O
, O
and O
he O
's O
reckoned O
something O
. O
Come O
aboard O
, O
come O
aboard O
; O
never O
mind O
about O
the O
papers O
. O
I O
say O
, O
tell O
Quohog O
there—what O
's O
that O
you O
call O
him O
? O
tell O
Quohog O
to O
step O
along O
. O
By O
the O
great O
anchor O
, O
what O
a O
harpoon O
he O
's O
got O
there O
! O
looks O
like O
good O
stuff O
that O
; O
and O
he O
handles O
it O
about O
right O
. O
I O
say O
, O
Quohog O
, O
or O
whatever O
your O
name O
is O
, O
did O
you O
ever O
stand O
in O
the O
head O
of O
a O
whale-boat O
? O
did O
you O
ever O
strike O
a O
fish O
? O
" O
Without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
in O
his O
wild O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
jumped O
upon O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
from O
thence O
into O
the O
bows O
of O
one O
of O
the O
whale-boats O
hanging O
to O
the O
side O
; O
and O
then O
bracing O
his O
left O
knee O
, O
and O
poising O
his O
harpoon O
, O
cried O
out O
in O
some O
such O
way O
as O
this O
: O
— O
" O
Cap'ain O
, O
you O
see O
him O
small O
drop O
tar O
on O
water O
dere O
? O
You O
see O
him O
? O
well O
, O
spose O
him O
one O
whale O
eye O
, O
well O
, O
den O
! O
" O
and O
taking O
sharp O
aim O
at O
it O
, O
he O
darted O
the O
iron O
right O
over O
old O
Bildad O
's O
broad O
brim O
, O
clean O
across O
the O
ship O
's O
decks O
, O
and O
struck O
the O
glistening O
tar O
spot O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
" O
said O
Queequeg O
, O
quietly O
hauling O
in O
the O
line O
, O
" O
spos-ee O
him O
whale-e O
eye O
; O
why O
, O
dad O
whale O
dead O
. O
" O
" O
Quick O
, O
Bildad O
, O
" O
said O
Peleg O
, O
his O
partner O
, O
who O
, O
aghast O
at O
the O
close O
vicinity O
of O
the O
flying O
harpoon O
, O
had O
retreated O
towards O
the O
cabin O
gangway O
. O
" O
Quick O
, O
I O
say O
, O
you O
Bildad O
, O
and O
get O
the O
ship O
's O
papers O
. O
We O
must O
have O
Hedgehog O
there O
, O
I O
mean O
Quohog O
, O
in O
one O
of O
our O
boats O
. O
Look O
ye O
, O
Quohog O
, O
we O
'll O
give O
ye O
the O
ninetieth O
lay O
, O
and O
that O
's O
more O
than O
ever O
was O
given O
a O
harpooneer O
yet O
out O
of O
Nantucket O
. O
" O
So O
down O
we O
went O
into O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
to O
my O
great O
joy O
Queequeg O
was O
soon O
enrolled O
among O
the O
same O
ship O
's O
company O
to O
which O
I O
myself O
belonged O
. O
When O
all O
preliminaries O
were O
over O
and O
Peleg O
had O
got O
everything O
ready O
for O
signing O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
me O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
guess O
, O
Quohog O
there O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
write O
, O
does O
he O
? O
I O
say O
, O
Quohog O
, O
blast O
ye O
! O
dost O
thou O
sign O
thy O
name O
or O
make O
thy O
mark O
? O
" O
But O
at O
this O
question O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
who O
had O
twice O
or O
thrice O
before O
taken O
part O
in O
similar O
ceremonies O
, O
looked O
no O
ways O
abashed O
; O
but O
taking O
the O
offered O
pen O
, O
copied O
upon O
the O
paper O
, O
in O
the O
proper O
place O
, O
an O
exact O
counterpart O
of O
a O
queer O
round O
figure O
which O
was O
tattooed O
upon O
his O
arm O
; O
so O
that O
through O
Captain O
Peleg O
's O
obstinate O
mistake O
touching O
his O
appellative O
, O
it O
stood O
something O
like O
this O
: O
— O
Quohog O
. O
his O
✠ O
mark O
. O
Meanwhile O
Captain O
Bildad O
sat O
earnestly O
and O
steadfastly O
eyeing O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
at O
last O
rising O
solemnly O
and O
fumbling O
in O
the O
huge O
pockets O
of O
his O
broad-skirted O
drab O
coat O
, O
took O
out O
a O
bundle O
of O
tracts O
, O
and O
selecting O
one O
entitled O
" O
The O
Latter O
Day O
Coming O
; O
or O
No O
Time O
to O
Lose O
, O
" O
placed O
it O
in O
Queequeg O
's O
hands O
, O
and O
then O
grasping O
them O
and O
the O
book O
with O
both O
his O
, O
looked O
earnestly O
into O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Son O
of O
darkness O
, O
I O
must O
do O
my O
duty O
by O
thee O
; O
I O
am O
part O
owner O
of O
this O
ship O
, O
and O
feel O
concerned O
for O
the O
souls O
of O
all O
its O
crew O
; O
if O
thou O
still O
clingest O
to O
thy O
Pagan O
ways O
, O
which O
I O
sadly O
fear O
, O
I O
beseech O
thee O
, O
remain O
not O
for O
aye O
a O
Belial O
bondsman O
. O
Spurn O
the O
idol O
Bell O
, O
and O
the O
hideous O
dragon O
; O
turn O
from O
the O
wrath O
to O
come O
; O
mind O
thine O
eye O
, O
I O
say O
; O
oh O
! O
goodness O
gracious O
! O
steer O
clear O
of O
the O
fiery O
pit O
! O
" O
Something O
of O
the O
salt O
sea O
yet O
lingered O
in O
old O
Bildad O
's O
language O
, O
heterogeneously O
mixed O
with O
Scriptural O
and O
domestic O
phrases O
. O
" O
Avast O
there O
, O
avast O
there O
, O
Bildad O
, O
avast O
now O
spoiling O
our O
harpooneer O
, O
" O
cried O
Peleg O
. O
" O
Pious O
harpooneers O
never O
make O
good O
voyagers—it O
takes O
the O
shark O
out O
of O
'em O
; O
no O
harpooneer O
is O
worth O
a O
straw O
who O
aint O
pretty O
sharkish O
. O
There O
was O
young O
Nat O
Swaine O
, O
once O
the O
bravest O
boat-header O
out O
of O
all O
Nantucket O
and O
the O
Vineyard O
; O
he O
joined O
the O
meeting O
, O
and O
never O
came O
to O
good O
. O
He O
got O
so O
frightened O
about O
his O
plaguy O
soul O
, O
that O
he O
shrinked O
and O
sheered O
away O
from O
whales O
, O
for O
fear O
of O
after-claps O
, O
in O
case O
he O
got O
stove O
and O
went O
to O
Davy O
Jones O
. O
" O
" O
Peleg O
! O
Peleg O
! O
" O
said O
Bildad O
, O
lifting O
his O
eyes O
and O
hands O
, O
" O
thou O
thyself O
, O
as O
I O
myself O
, O
hast O
seen O
many O
a O
perilous O
time O
; O
thou O
knowest O
, O
Peleg O
, O
what O
it O
is O
to O
have O
the O
fear O
of O
death O
; O
how O
, O
then O
, O
can'st O
thou O
prate O
in O
this O
ungodly O
guise O
. O
Thou O
beliest O
thine O
own O
heart O
, O
Peleg O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
when O
this O
same O
Pequod O
here O
had O
her O
three O
masts O
overboard O
in O
that O
typhoon O
on O
Japan O
, O
that O
same O
voyage O
when O
thou O
went O
mate O
with O
Captain O
Ahab O
, O
did'st O
thou O
not O
think O
of O
Death O
and O
the O
Judgment O
then O
? O
" O
" O
Hear O
him O
, O
hear O
him O
now O
, O
" O
cried O
Peleg O
, O
marching O
across O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
thrusting O
his O
hands O
far O
down O
into O
his O
pockets O
, O
— O
" O
hear O
him O
, O
all O
of O
ye O
. O
Think O
of O
that O
! O
When O
every O
moment O
we O
thought O
the O
ship O
would O
sink O
! O
Death O
and O
the O
Judgment O
then O
? O
What O
? O
With O
all O
three O
masts O
making O
such O
an O
everlasting O
thundering O
against O
the O
side O
; O
and O
every O
sea O
breaking O
over O
us O
, O
fore O
and O
aft O
. O
Think O
of O
Death O
and O
the O
Judgment O
then O
? O
No O
! O
no O
time O
to O
think O
about O
Death O
then O
. O
Life O
was O
what O
Captain O
Ahab O
and O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
; O
and O
how O
to O
save O
all O
hands—how O
to O
rig O
jury-masts—how O
to O
get O
into O
the O
nearest O
port O
; O
that O
was O
what O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
. O
" O
Bildad O
said O
no O
more O
, O
but O
buttoning O
up O
his O
coat O
, O
stalked O
on O
deck O
, O
where O
we O
followed O
him O
. O
There O
he O
stood O
, O
very O
quietly O
overlooking O
some O
sail-makers O
who O
were O
mending O
a O
top-sail O
in O
the O
waist O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
he O
stooped O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
patch O
, O
or O
save O
an O
end O
of O
tarred O
twine O
, O
which O
otherwise O
might O
have O
been O
wasted O
. O
