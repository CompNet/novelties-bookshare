Nimble O
as O
a O
cat O
, O
Tashtego O
mounts O
aloft O
; O
and O
without O
altering O
his O
erect O
posture O
, O
runs O
straight O
out O
upon O
the O
overhanging O
main-yard-arm O
, O
to O
the O
part O
where O
it O
exactly O
projects O
over O
the O
hoisted O
Tun O
. O
He O
has O
carried O
with O
him O
a O
light O
tackle O
called O
a O
whip O
, O
consisting O
of O
only O
two O
parts O
, O
travelling O
through O
a O
single-sheaved O
block O
. O
Securing O
this O
block O
, O
so O
that O
it O
hangs O
down O
from O
the O
yard-arm O
, O
he O
swings O
one O
end O
of O
the O
rope O
, O
till O
it O
is O
caught O
and O
firmly O
held O
by O
a O
hand O
on O
deck O
. O
Then O
, O
hand-over-hand O
, O
down O
the O
other O
part O
, O
the O
Indian O
drops O
through O
the O
air O
, O
till O
dexterously O
he O
lands O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
head O
. O
There—still O
high O
elevated O
above O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
company O
, O
to O
whom O
he O
vivaciously O
cries—he O
seems O
some O
Turkish O
Muezzin O
calling O
the O
good O
people O
to O
prayers O
from O
the O
top O
of O
a O
tower O
. O
A O
short-handled O
sharp O
spade O
being O
sent O
up O
to O
him O
, O
he O
diligently O
searches O
for O
the O
proper O
place O
to O
begin O
breaking O
into O
the O
Tun O
. O
In O
this O
business O
he O
proceeds O
very O
heedfully O
, O
like O
a O
treasure-hunter O
in O
some O
old O
house O
, O
sounding O
the O
walls O
to O
find O
where O
the O
gold O
is O
masoned O
in O
. O
By O
the O
time O
this O
cautious O
search O
is O
over O
, O
a O
stout O
iron-bound O
bucket O
, O
precisely O
like O
a O
well-bucket O
, O
has O
been O
attached O
to O
one O
end O
of O
the O
whip O
; O
while O
the O
other O
end O
, O
being O
stretched O
across O
the O
deck O
, O
is O
there O
held O
by O
two O
or O
three O
alert O
hands O
. O
These O
last O
now O
hoist O
the O
bucket O
within O
grasp O
of O
the O
Indian O
, O
to O
whom O
another O
person O
has O
reached O
up O
a O
very O
long O
pole O
. O
Inserting O
this O
pole O
into O
the O
bucket O
, O
Tashtego O
downward O
guides O
the O
bucket O
into O
the O
Tun O
, O
till O
it O
entirely O
disappears O
; O
then O
giving O
the O
word O
to O
the O
seamen O
at O
the O
whip O
, O
up O
comes O
the O
bucket O
again O
, O
all O
bubbling O
like O
a O
dairy-maid O
's O
pail O
of O
new O
milk O
. O
Carefully O
lowered O
from O
its O
height O
, O
the O
full-freighted O
vessel O
is O
caught O
by O
an O
appointed O
hand O
, O
and O
quickly O
emptied O
into O
a O
large O
tub O
. O
Then O
re-mounting O
aloft O
, O
it O
again O
goes O
through O
the O
same O
round O
until O
the O
deep O
cistern O
will O
yield O
no O
more O
. O
Towards O
the O
end O
, O
Tashtego O
has O
to O
ram O
his O
long O
pole O
harder O
and O
harder O
, O
and O
deeper O
and O
deeper O
into O
the O
Tun O
, O
until O
some O
twenty O
feet O
of O
the O
pole O
have O
gone O
down O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
people O
of O
the O
Pequod O
had O
been O
baling O
some O
time O
in O
this O
way O
; O
several O
tubs O
had O
been O
filled O
with O
the O
fragrant O
sperm O
; O
when O
all O
at O
once O
a O
queer O
accident O
happened O
. O
Whether O
it O
was O
that O
Tashtego O
, O
that O
wild O
Indian O
, O
was O
so O
heedless O
and O
reckless O
as O
to O
let O
go O
for O
a O
moment O
his O
one-handed O
hold O
on O
the O
great O
cabled O
tackles O
suspending O
the O
head O
; O
or O
whether O
the O
place O
where O
he O
stood O
was O
so O
treacherous O
and O
oozy O
; O
or O
whether O
the O
Evil O
One O
himself O
would O
have O
it O
to O
fall O
out O
so O
, O
without O
stating O
his O
particular O
reasons O
; O
how O
it O
was O
exactly O
, O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
now O
; O
but O
, O
on O
a O
sudden O
, O
as O
the O
eightieth O
or O
ninetieth O
bucket O
came O
suckingly O
up—my O
God O
! O
poor O
Tashtego—like O
the O
twin O
reciprocating O
bucket O
in O
a O
veritable O
well O
, O
dropped O
head-foremost O
down O
into O
this O
great O
Tun O
of O
Heidelburgh O
, O
and O
with O
a O
horrible O
oily O
gurgling O
, O
went O
clean O
out O
of O
sight O
! O
" O
Man O
overboard O
! O
" O
cried O
Daggoo O
, O
who O
amid O
the O
general O
consternation O
first O
came O
to O
his O
senses O
. O
" O
Swing O
the O
bucket O
this O
way O
! O
" O
and O
putting O
one O
foot O
into O
it O
, O
so O
as O
the O
better O
to O
secure O
his O
slippery O
hand-hold O
on O
the O
whip O
itself O
, O
the O
hoisters O
ran O
him O
high O
up O
to O
the O
top O
of O
the O
head O
, O
almost O
before O
Tashtego O
could O
have O
reached O
its O
interior O
bottom O
. O
Meantime O
, O
there O
was O
a O
terrible O
tumult O
. O
Looking O
over O
the O
side O
, O
they O
saw O
the O
before O
lifeless O
head O
throbbing O
and O
heaving O
just O
below O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
as O
if O
that O
moment O
seized O
with O
some O
momentous O
idea O
; O
whereas O
it O
was O
only O
the O
poor O
Indian O
unconsciously O
revealing O
by O
those O
struggles O
the O
perilous O
depth O
to O
which O
he O
had O
sunk O
. O
At O
this O
instant O
, O
while O
Daggoo O
, O
on O
the O
summit O
of O
the O
head O
, O
was O
clearing O
the O
whip—which O
had O
somehow O
got O
foul O
of O
the O
great O
cutting O
tackles—a O
sharp O
cracking O
noise O
was O
heard O
; O
and O
to O
the O
unspeakable O
horror O
of O
all O
, O
one O
of O
the O
two O
enormous O
hooks O
suspending O
the O
head O
tore O
out O
, O
and O
with O
a O
vast O
vibration O
the O
enormous O
mass O
sideways O
swung O
, O
till O
the O
drunk O
ship O
reeled O
and O
shook O
as O
if O
smitten O
by O
an O
iceberg O
. O
The O
one O
remaining O
hook O
, O
upon O
which O
the O
entire O
strain O
now O
depended O
, O
seemed O
every O
instant O
to O
be O
on O
the O
point O
of O
giving O
way O
; O
an O
event O
still O
more O
likely O
from O
the O
violent O
motions O
of O
the O
head O
. O
" O
Come O
down O
, O
come O
down O
! O
" O
yelled O
the O
seamen O
to O
Daggoo O
, O
but O
with O
one O
hand O
holding O
on O
to O
the O
heavy O
tackles O
, O
so O
that O
if O
the O
head O
should O
drop O
, O
he O
would O
still O
remain O
suspended O
; O
the O
negro O
having O
cleared O
the O
foul O
line O
, O
rammed O
down O
the O
bucket O
into O
the O
now O
collapsed O
well O
, O
meaning O
that O
the O
buried O
harpooneer O
should O
grasp O
it O
, O
and O
so O
be O
hoisted O
out O
. O
" O
In O
heaven O
's O
name O
, O
man O
, O
" O
cried O
Stubb O
, O
" O
are O
you O
ramming O
home O
a O
cartridge O
there O
? O
—Avast O
! O
How O
will O
that O
help O
him O
; O
jamming O
that O
iron-bound O
bucket O
on O
top O
of O
his O
head O
? O
Avast O
, O
will O
ye O
! O
" O
" O
Stand O
clear O
of O
the O
tackle O
! O
" O
cried O
a O
voice O
like O
the O
bursting O
of O
a O
rocket O
. O
Almost O
in O
the O
same O
instant O
, O
with O
a O
thunder-boom O
, O
the O
enormous O
mass O
dropped O
into O
the O
sea O
, O
like O
Niagara O
's O
Table-Rock O
into O
the O
whirlpool O
; O
the O
suddenly O
relieved O
hull O
rolled O
away O
from O
it O
, O
to O
far O
down O
her O
glittering O
copper O
; O
and O
all O
caught O
their O
breath O
, O
as O
half O
swinging—now O
over O
the O
sailors O
' O
heads O
, O
and O
now O
over O
the O
water—Daggoo O
, O
through O
a O
thick O
mist O
of O
spray O
, O
was O
dimly O
beheld O
clinging O
to O
the O
pendulous O
tackles O
, O
while O
poor O
, O
buried-alive O
Tashtego O
was O
sinking O
utterly O
down O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
! O
But O
hardly O
had O
the O
blinding O
vapor O
cleared O
away O
, O
when O
a O
naked O
figure O
with O
a O
boarding-sword O
in O
its O
hand O
, O
was O
for O
one O
swift O
moment O
seen O
hovering O
over O
the O
bulwarks O
. O
The O
next O
, O
a O
loud O
splash O
announced O
that O
my O
brave O
Queequeg O
had O
dived O
to O
the O
rescue O
. O
One O
packed O
rush O
was O
made O
to O
the O
side O
, O
and O
every O
eye O
counted O
every O
ripple O
, O
as O
moment O
followed O
moment O
, O
and O
no O
sign O
of O
either O
the O
sinker O
or O
the O
diver O
could O
be O
seen O
. O
Some O
hands O
now O
jumped O
into O
a O
boat O
alongside O
, O
and O
pushed O
a O
little O
off O
from O
the O
ship O
. O
" O
Ha O
! O
ha O
! O
" O
cried O
Daggoo O
, O
all O
at O
once O
, O
from O
his O
now O
quiet O
, O
swinging O
perch O
overhead O
; O
and O
looking O
further O
off O
from O
the O
side O
, O
we O
saw O
an O
arm O
thrust O
upright O
from O
the O
blue O
waves O
; O
a O
sight O
strange O
to O
see O
, O
as O
an O
arm O
thrust O
forth O
from O
the O
grass O
over O
a O
grave O
. O
" O
Both O
! O
both O
! O
—it O
is O
both O
! O
" O
—cried O
Daggoo O
again O
with O
a O
joyful O
shout O
; O
and O
soon O
after O
, O
Queequeg O
was O
seen O
boldly O
striking O
out O
with O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
with O
the O
other O
clutching O
the O
long O
hair O
of O
the O
Indian O
. O
Drawn O
into O
the O
waiting O
boat O
, O
they O
were O
quickly O
brought O
to O
the O
deck O
; O
but O
Tashtego O
was O
long O
in O
coming O
to O
, O
and O
Queequeg O
did O
not O
look O
very O
brisk O
. O
Now O
, O
how O
had O
this O
noble O
rescue O
been O
accomplished O
? O
Why O
, O
diving O
after O
the O
slowly O
descending O
head O
, O
Queequeg O
with O
his O
keen O
sword O
had O
made O
side O
lunges O
near O
its O
bottom O
, O
so O
as O
to O
scuttle O
a O
large O
hole O
there O
; O
then O
dropping O
his O
sword O
, O
had O
thrust O
his O
long O
arm O
far O
inwards O
and O
upwards O
, O
and O
so O
hauled O
out O
our O
poor O
Tash O
by O
the O
head O
. O
He O
averred O
, O
that O
upon O
first O
thrusting O
in O
for O
him O
, O
a O
leg O
was O
presented O
; O
but O
well O
knowing O
that O
that O
was O
not O
as O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
and O
might O
occasion O
great O
trouble O
; O
—he O
had O
thrust O
back O
the O
leg O
, O
and O
by O
a O
dexterous O
heave O
and O
toss O
, O
had O
wrought O
a O
somerset O
upon O
the O
Indian O
; O
so O
that O
with O
the O
next O
trial O
, O
he O
came O
forth O
in O
the O
good O
old O
way—head O
foremost O
. O
As O
for O
the O
great O
head O
itself O
, O
that O
was O
doing O
as O
well O
as O
could O
be O
expected O
. O
And O
thus O
, O
through O
the O
courage O
and O
great O
skill O
in O
obstetrics O
of O
Queequeg O
, O
the O
deliverance O
, O
or O
rather O
, O
delivery O
of O
Tashtego O
, O
was O
successfully O
accomplished O
, O
in O
the O
teeth O
, O
too O
, O
of O
the O
most O
untoward O
and O
apparently O
hopeless O
impediments O
; O
which O
is O
a O
lesson O
by O
no O
means O
to O
be O
forgotten O
. O
Midwifery O
should O
be O
taught O
in O
the O
same O
course O
with O
fencing O
and O
boxing O
, O
riding O
and O
rowing O
. O
I O
know O
that O
this O
queer O
adventure O
of O
the O
Gay-Header O
's O
will O
be O
sure O
to O
seem O
incredible O
to O
some O
landsmen O
, O
though O
they O
themselves O
may O
have O
either O
seen O
or O
heard O
of O
some O
one O
's O
falling O
into O
a O
cistern O
ashore O
; O
an O
accident O
which O
not O
seldom O
happens O
, O
and O
with O
much O
less O
reason O
too O
than O
the O
Indian O
's O
, O
considering O
the O
exceeding O
slipperiness O
of O
the O
curb O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
well O
. O
But O
, O
peradventure O
, O
it O
may O
be O
sagaciously O
urged O
, O
how O
is O
this O
? O
We O
thought O
the O
tissued O
, O
infiltrated O
head O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
was O
the O
lightest O
and O
most O
corky O
part O
about O
him O
; O
and O
yet O
thou O
makest O
it O
sink O
in O
an O
element O
of O
a O
far O
greater O
specific O
gravity O
than O
itself O
. O
We O
have O
thee O
there O
. O
Not O
at O
all O
, O
but O
I O
have O
ye O
; O
for O
at O
the O
time O
poor O
Tash O
fell O
in O
, O
the O
case O
had O
been O
nearly O
emptied O
of O
its O
lighter O
contents O
, O
leaving O
little O
but O
the O
dense O
tendinous O
wall O
of O
the O
well—a O
double O
welded O
, O
hammered O
substance O
, O
as O
I O
have O
before O
said O
, O
much O
heavier O
than O
the O
sea O
water O
, O
and O
a O
lump O
of O
which O
sinks O
in O
it O
like O
lead O
almost O
. O
But O
the O
tendency O
to O
rapid O
sinking O
in O
this O
substance O
was O
in O
the O
present O
instance O
materially O
counteracted O
by O
the O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
head O
remaining O
undetached O
from O
it O
, O
so O
that O
it O
sank O
very O
slowly O
and O
deliberately O
indeed O
, O
affording O
Queequeg O
a O
fair O
chance O
for O
performing O
his O
agile O
obstetrics O
on O
the O
run O
, O
as O
you O
may O
say O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
was O
a O
running O
delivery O
, O
so O
it O
was O
. O
Now O
, O
had O
Tashtego O
perished O
in O
that O
head O
, O
it O
had O
been O
a O
very O
precious O
perishing O
; O
smothered O
in O
the O
very O
whitest O
and O
daintiest O
of O
fragrant O
spermaceti O
; O
coffined O
, O
hearsed O
, O
and O
tombed O
in O
the O
secret O
inner O
chamber O
and O
sanctum O
sanctorum O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
Only O
one O
sweeter O
end O
can O
readily O
be O
recalled—the O
delicious O
death O
of O
an O
Ohio O
honey-hunter O
, O
who O
seeking O
honey O
in O
the O
crotch O
of O
a O
hollow O
tree O
, O
found O
such O
exceeding O
store O
of O
it O
, O
that O
leaning O
too O
far O
over O
, O
it O
sucked O
him O
in O
, O
so O
that O
he O
died O
embalmed O
. O
How O
many O
, O
think O
ye O
, O
have O
likewise O
fallen O
into O
Plato O
's O
honey O
head O
, O
and O
sweetly O
perished O
there O
? O
