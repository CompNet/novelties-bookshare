Queequeg O
was O
a O
native O
of O
Rokovoko O
, O
an O
island O
far O
away O
to O
the O
West O
and O
South O
. O
It O
is O
not O
down O
in O
any O
map O
; O
true O
places O
never O
are O
. O
When O
a O
new-hatched O
savage O
running O
wild O
about O
his O
native O
woodlands O
in O
a O
grass O
clout O
, O
followed O
by O
the O
nibbling O
goats O
, O
as O
if O
he O
were O
a O
green O
sapling O
; O
even O
then O
, O
in O
Queequeg O
's O
ambitious O
soul O
, O
lurked O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
see O
something O
more O
of O
Christendom O
than O
a O
specimen O
whaler O
or O
two O
. O
His O
father O
was O
a O
High O
Chief O
, O
a O
King O
; O
his O
uncle O
a O
High O
Priest O
; O
and O
on O
the O
maternal O
side O
he O
boasted O
aunts O
who O
were O
the O
wives O
of O
unconquerable O
warriors O
. O
There O
was O
excellent O
blood O
in O
his O
veins—royal O
stuff O
; O
though O
sadly O
vitiated O
, O
I O
fear O
, O
by O
the O
cannibal O
propensity O
he O
nourished O
in O
his O
untutored O
youth O
. O
A O
Sag O
Harbor O
ship O
visited O
his O
father O
's O
bay O
, O
and O
Queequeg O
sought O
a O
passage O
to O
Christian O
lands O
. O
But O
the O
ship O
, O
having O
her O
full O
complement O
of O
seamen O
, O
spurned O
his O
suit O
; O
and O
not O
all O
the O
King O
his O
father O
's O
influence O
could O
prevail O
. O
But O
Queequeg O
vowed O
a O
vow O
. O
Alone O
in O
his O
canoe O
, O
he O
paddled O
off O
to O
a O
distant O
strait O
, O
which O
he O
knew O
the O
ship O
must O
pass O
through O
when O
she O
quitted O
the O
island O
. O
On O
one O
side O
was O
a O
coral O
reef O
; O
on O
the O
other O
a O
low O
tongue O
of O
land O
, O
covered O
with O
mangrove O
thickets O
that O
grew O
out O
into O
the O
water O
. O
Hiding O
his O
canoe O
, O
still O
afloat O
, O
among O
these O
thickets O
, O
with O
its O
prow O
seaward O
, O
he O
sat O
down O
in O
the O
stern O
, O
paddle O
low O
in O
hand O
; O
and O
when O
the O
ship O
was O
gliding O
by O
, O
like O
a O
flash O
he O
darted O
out O
; O
gained O
her O
side O
; O
with O
one O
backward O
dash O
of O
his O
foot O
capsized O
and O
sank O
his O
canoe O
; O
climbed O
up O
the O
chains O
; O
and O
throwing O
himself O
at O
full O
length O
upon O
the O
deck O
, O
grappled O
a O
ring-bolt O
there O
, O
and O
swore O
not O
to O
let O
it O
go O
, O
though O
hacked O
in O
pieces O
. O
In O
vain O
the O
captain O
threatened O
to O
throw O
him O
overboard O
; O
suspended O
a O
cutlass O
over O
his O
naked O
wrists O
; O
Queequeg O
was O
the O
son O
of O
a O
King O
, O
and O
Queequeg O
budged O
not O
. O
Struck O
by O
his O
desperate O
dauntlessness O
, O
and O
his O
wild O
desire O
to O
visit O
Christendom O
, O
the O
captain O
at O
last O
relented O
, O
and O
told O
him O
he O
might O
make O
himself O
at O
home O
. O
But O
this O
fine O
young O
savage—this O
sea O
Prince O
of O
Wales O
, O
never O
saw O
the O
captain O
's O
cabin O
. O
They O
put O
him O
down O
among O
the O
sailors O
, O
and O
made O
a O
whaleman O
of O
him O
. O
But O
like O
Czar O
Peter O
content O
to O
toil O
in O
the O
shipyards O
of O
foreign O
cities O
, O
Queequeg O
disdained O
no O
seeming O
ignominy O
, O
if O
thereby O
he O
might O
happily O
gain O
the O
power O
of O
enlightening O
his O
untutored O
countrymen O
. O
For O
at O
bottom—so O
he O
told O
me—he O
was O
actuated O
by O
a O
profound O
desire O
to O
learn O
among O
the O
Christians O
, O
the O
arts O
whereby O
to O
make O
his O
people O
still O
happier O
than O
they O
were O
; O
and O
more O
than O
that O
, O
still O
better O
than O
they O
were O
. O
But O
, O
alas O
! O
the O
practices O
of O
whalemen O
soon O
convinced O
him O
that O
even O
Christians O
could O
be O
both O
miserable O
and O
wicked O
; O
infinitely O
more O
so O
, O
than O
all O
his O
father O
's O
heathens O
. O
Arrived O
at O
last O
in O
old O
Sag O
Harbor O
; O
and O
seeing O
what O
the O
sailors O
did O
there O
; O
and O
then O
going O
on O
to O
Nantucket O
, O
and O
seeing O
how O
they O
spent O
their O
wages O
in O
_that_ O
place O
also O
, O
poor O
Queequeg O
gave O
it O
up O
for O
lost O
. O
Thought O
he O
, O
it O
's O
a O
wicked O
world O
in O
all O
meridians O
; O
I O
'll O
die O
a O
pagan O
. O
And O
thus O
an O
old O
idolator O
at O
heart O
, O
he O
yet O
lived O
among O
these O
Christians O
, O
wore O
their O
clothes O
, O
and O
tried O
to O
talk O
their O
gibberish O
. O
Hence O
the O
queer O
ways O
about O
him O
, O
though O
now O
some O
time O
from O
home O
. O
By O
hints O
, O
I O
asked O
him O
whether O
he O
did O
not O
propose O
going O
back O
, O
and O
having O
a O
coronation O
; O
since O
he O
might O
now O
consider O
his O
father O
dead O
and O
gone O
, O
he O
being O
very O
old O
and O
feeble O
at O
the O
last O
accounts O
. O
He O
answered O
no O
, O
not O
yet O
; O
and O
added O
that O
he O
was O
fearful O
Christianity O
, O
or O
rather O
Christians O
, O
had O
unfitted O
him O
for O
ascending O
the O
pure O
and O
undefiled O
throne O
of O
thirty O
pagan O
Kings O
before O
him O
. O
But O
by O
and O
by O
, O
he O
said O
, O
he O
would O
return O
, O
—as O
soon O
as O
he O
felt O
himself O
baptized O
again O
. O
For O
the O
nonce O
, O
however O
, O
he O
proposed O
to O
sail O
about O
, O
and O
sow O
his O
wild O
oats O
in O
all O
four O
oceans O
. O
They O
had O
made O
a O
harpooneer O
of O
him O
, O
and O
that O
barbed O
iron O
was O
in O
lieu O
of O
a O
sceptre O
now O
. O
I O
asked O
him O
what O
might O
be O
his O
immediate O
purpose O
, O
touching O
his O
future O
movements O
. O
He O
answered O
, O
to O
go O
to O
sea O
again O
, O
in O
his O
old O
vocation O
. O
Upon O
this O
, O
I O
told O
him O
that O
whaling O
was O
my O
own O
design O
, O
and O
informed O
him O
of O
my O
intention O
to O
sail O
out O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
as O
being O
the O
most O
promising O
port O
for O
an O
adventurous O
whaleman O
to O
embark O
from O
. O
He O
at O
once O
resolved O
to O
accompany O
me O
to O
that O
island O
, O
ship O
aboard O
the O
same O
vessel O
, O
get O
into O
the O
same O
watch O
, O
the O
same O
boat O
, O
the O
same O
mess O
with O
me O
, O
in O
short O
to O
share O
my O
every O
hap O
; O
with O
both O
my O
hands O
in O
his O
, O
boldly O
dip O
into O
the O
Potluck O
of O
both O
worlds O
. O
To O
all O
this O
I O
joyously O
assented O
; O
for O
besides O
the O
affection O
I O
now O
felt O
for O
Queequeg O
, O
he O
was O
an O
experienced O
harpooneer O
, O
and O
as O
such O
, O
could O
not O
fail O
to O
be O
of O
great O
usefulness O
to O
one O
, O
who O
, O
like O
me O
, O
was O
wholly O
ignorant O
of O
the O
mysteries O
of O
whaling O
, O
though O
well O
acquainted O
with O
the O
sea O
, O
as O
known O
to O
merchant O
seamen O
. O
His O
story O
being O
ended O
with O
his O
pipe O
's O
last O
dying O
puff O
, O
Queequeg O
embraced O
me O
, O
pressed O
his O
forehead O
against O
mine O
, O
and O
blowing O
out O
the O
light O
, O
we O
rolled O
over O
from O
each O
other O
, O
this O
way O
and O
that O
, O
and O
very O
soon O
were O
sleeping O
. O
