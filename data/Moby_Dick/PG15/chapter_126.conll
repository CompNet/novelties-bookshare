Steering O
now O
south-eastward O
by O
Ahab O
's O
levelled O
steel O
, O
and O
her O
progress O
solely O
determined O
by O
Ahab O
's O
level O
log O
and O
line O
; O
the O
Pequod O
held O
on O
her O
path O
towards O
the O
Equator O
. O
Making O
so O
long O
a O
passage O
through O
such O
unfrequented O
waters O
, O
descrying O
no O
ships O
, O
and O
ere O
long O
, O
sideways O
impelled O
by O
unvarying O
trade O
winds O
, O
over O
waves O
monotonously O
mild O
; O
all O
these O
seemed O
the O
strange O
calm O
things O
preluding O
some O
riotous O
and O
desperate O
scene O
. O
At O
last O
, O
when O
the O
ship O
drew O
near O
to O
the O
outskirts O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
of O
the O
Equatorial O
fishing-ground O
, O
and O
in O
the O
deep O
darkness O
that O
goes O
before O
the O
dawn O
, O
was O
sailing O
by O
a O
cluster O
of O
rocky O
islets O
; O
the O
watch—then O
headed O
by O
Flask—was O
startled O
by O
a O
cry O
so O
plaintively O
wild O
and O
unearthly—like O
half-articulated O
wailings O
of O
the O
ghosts O
of O
all O
Herod O
's O
murdered O
Innocents—that O
one O
and O
all O
, O
they O
started O
from O
their O
reveries O
, O
and O
for O
the O
space O
of O
some O
moments O
stood O
, O
or O
sat O
, O
or O
leaned O
all O
transfixedly O
listening O
, O
like O
the O
carved O
Roman O
slave O
, O
while O
that O
wild O
cry O
remained O
within O
hearing O
. O
The O
Christian O
or O
civilized O
part O
of O
the O
crew O
said O
it O
was O
mermaids O
, O
and O
shuddered O
; O
but O
the O
pagan O
harpooneers O
remained O
unappalled O
. O
Yet O
the O
grey O
Manxman—the O
oldest O
mariner O
of O
all—declared O
that O
the O
wild O
thrilling O
sounds O
that O
were O
heard O
, O
were O
the O
voices O
of O
newly O
drowned O
men O
in O
the O
sea O
. O
Below O
in O
his O
hammock O
, O
Ahab O
did O
not O
hear O
of O
this O
till O
grey O
dawn O
, O
when O
he O
came O
to O
the O
deck O
; O
it O
was O
then O
recounted O
to O
him O
by O
Flask O
, O
not O
unaccompanied O
with O
hinted O
dark O
meanings O
. O
He O
hollowly O
laughed O
, O
and O
thus O
explained O
the O
wonder O
. O
Those O
rocky O
islands O
the O
ship O
had O
passed O
were O
the O
resort O
of O
great O
numbers O
of O
seals O
, O
and O
some O
young O
seals O
that O
had O
lost O
their O
dams O
, O
or O
some O
dams O
that O
had O
lost O
their O
cubs O
, O
must O
have O
risen O
nigh O
the O
ship O
and O
kept O
company O
with O
her O
, O
crying O
and O
sobbing O
with O
their O
human O
sort O
of O
wail O
. O
But O
this O
only O
the O
more O
affected O
some O
of O
them O
, O
because O
most O
mariners O
cherish O
a O
very O
superstitious O
feeling O
about O
seals O
, O
arising O
not O
only O
from O
their O
peculiar O
tones O
when O
in O
distress O
, O
but O
also O
from O
the O
human O
look O
of O
their O
round O
heads O
and O
semi-intelligent O
faces O
, O
seen O
peeringly O
uprising O
from O
the O
water O
alongside O
. O
In O
the O
sea O
, O
under O
certain O
circumstances O
, O
seals O
have O
more O
than O
once O
been O
mistaken O
for O
men O
. O
But O
the O
bodings O
of O
the O
crew O
were O
destined O
to O
receive O
a O
most O
plausible O
confirmation O
in O
the O
fate O
of O
one O
of O
their O
number O
that O
morning O
. O
At O
sun-rise O
this O
man O
went O
from O
his O
hammock O
to O
his O
mast-head O
at O
the O
fore O
; O
and O
whether O
it O
was O
that O
he O
was O
not O
yet O
half O
waked O
from O
his O
sleep O
( O
for O
sailors O
sometimes O
go O
aloft O
in O
a O
transition O
state O
) O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
thus O
with O
the O
man O
, O
there O
is O
now O
no O
telling O
; O
but O
, O
be O
that O
as O
it O
may O
, O
he O
had O
not O
been O
long O
at O
his O
perch O
, O
when O
a O
cry O
was O
heard—a O
cry O
and O
a O
rushing—and O
looking O
up O
, O
they O
saw O
a O
falling O
phantom O
in O
the O
air O
; O
and O
looking O
down O
, O
a O
little O
tossed O
heap O
of O
white O
bubbles O
in O
the O
blue O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
The O
life-buoy—a O
long O
slender O
cask—was O
dropped O
from O
the O
stern O
, O
where O
it O
always O
hung O
obedient O
to O
a O
cunning O
spring O
; O
but O
no O
hand O
rose O
to O
seize O
it O
, O
and O
the O
sun O
having O
long O
beat O
upon O
this O
cask O
it O
had O
shrunken O
, O
so O
that O
it O
slowly O
filled O
, O
and O
the O
parched O
wood O
also O
filled O
at O
its O
every O
pore O
; O
and O
the O
studded O
iron-bound O
cask O
followed O
the O
sailor O
to O
the O
bottom O
, O
as O
if O
to O
yield O
him O
his O
pillow O
, O
though O
in O
sooth O
but O
a O
hard O
one O
. O
And O
thus O
the O
first O
man O
of O
the O
Pequod O
that O
mounted O
the O
mast O
to O
look O
out O
for O
the O
White O
Whale O
, O
on O
the O
White O
Whale O
's O
own O
peculiar O
ground O
; O
that O
man O
was O
swallowed O
up O
in O
the O
deep O
. O
But O
few O
, O
perhaps O
, O
thought O
of O
that O
at O
the O
time O
. O
Indeed O
, O
in O
some O
sort O
, O
they O
were O
not O
grieved O
at O
this O
event O
, O
at O
least O
as O
a O
portent O
; O
for O
they O
regarded O
it O
, O
not O
as O
a O
foreshadowing O
of O
evil O
in O
the O
future O
, O
but O
as O
the O
fulfilment O
of O
an O
evil O
already O
presaged O
. O
They O
declared O
that O
now O
they O
knew O
the O
reason O
of O
those O
wild O
shrieks O
they O
had O
heard O
the O
night O
before O
. O
But O
again O
the O
old O
Manxman O
said O
nay O
. O
The O
lost O
life-buoy O
was O
now O
to O
be O
replaced O
; O
Starbuck O
was O
directed O
to O
see O
to O
it O
; O
but O
as O
no O
cask O
of O
sufficient O
lightness O
could O
be O
found O
, O
and O
as O
in O
the O
feverish O
eagerness O
of O
what O
seemed O
the O
approaching O
crisis O
of O
the O
voyage O
, O
all O
hands O
were O
impatient O
of O
any O
toil O
but O
what O
was O
directly O
connected O
with O
its O
final O
end O
, O
whatever O
that O
might O
prove O
to O
be O
; O
therefore O
, O
they O
were O
going O
to O
leave O
the O
ship O
's O
stern O
unprovided O
with O
a O
buoy O
, O
when O
by O
certain O
strange O
signs O
and O
inuendoes O
Queequeg O
hinted O
a O
hint O
concerning O
his O
coffin O
. O
" O
A O
life-buoy O
of O
a O
coffin O
! O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
, O
starting O
. O
" O
Rather O
queer O
, O
that O
, O
I O
should O
say O
, O
" O
said O
Stubb O
. O
" O
It O
will O
make O
a O
good O
enough O
one O
, O
" O
said O
Flask O
, O
" O
the O
carpenter O
here O
can O
arrange O
it O
easily O
. O
" O
" O
Bring O
it O
up O
; O
there O
's O
nothing O
else O
for O
it O
, O
" O
said O
Starbuck O
, O
after O
a O
melancholy O
pause O
. O
" O
Rig O
it O
, O
carpenter O
; O
do O
not O
look O
at O
me O
so—the O
coffin O
, O
I O
mean O
. O
Dost O
thou O
hear O
me O
? O
Rig O
it O
. O
" O
" O
And O
shall O
I O
nail O
down O
the O
lid O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
moving O
his O
hand O
as O
with O
a O
hammer O
. O
" O
Aye O
. O
" O
" O
And O
shall O
I O
caulk O
the O
seams O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
moving O
his O
hand O
as O
with O
a O
caulking-iron O
. O
" O
Aye O
. O
" O
" O
And O
shall O
I O
then O
pay O
over O
the O
same O
with O
pitch O
, O
sir O
? O
" O
moving O
his O
hand O
as O
with O
a O
pitch-pot O
. O
" O
Away O
! O
what O
possesses O
thee O
to O
this O
? O
Make O
a O
life-buoy O
of O
the O
coffin O
, O
and O
no O
more.—Mr O
. O
Stubb O
, O
Mr. O
Flask O
, O
come O
forward O
with O
me O
. O
" O
" O
He O
goes O
off O
in O
a O
huff O
. O
The O
whole O
he O
can O
endure O
; O
at O
the O
parts O
he O
baulks O
. O
Now O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
. O
I O
make O
a O
leg O
for O
Captain O
Ahab O
, O
and O
he O
wears O
it O
like O
a O
gentleman O
; O
but O
I O
make O
a O
bandbox O
for O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
he O
wont O
put O
his O
head O
into O
it O
. O
Are O
all O
my O
pains O
to O
go O
for O
nothing O
with O
that O
coffin O
? O
And O
now O
I O
'm O
ordered O
to O
make O
a O
life-buoy O
of O
it O
. O
It O
's O
like O
turning O
an O
old O
coat O
; O
going O
to O
bring O
the O
flesh O
on O
the O
other O
side O
now O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
this O
cobbling O
sort O
of O
business—I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
at O
all O
; O
it O
's O
undignified O
; O
it O
's O
not O
my O
place O
. O
Let O
tinkers O
' O
brats O
do O
tinkerings O
; O
we O
are O
their O
betters O
. O
I O
like O
to O
take O
in O
hand O
none O
but O
clean O
, O
virgin O
, O
fair-and-square O
mathematical O
jobs O
, O
something O
that O
regularly O
begins O
at O
the O
beginning O
, O
and O
is O
at O
the O
middle O
when O
midway O
, O
and O
comes O
to O
an O
end O
at O
the O
conclusion O
; O
not O
a O
cobbler O
's O
job O
, O
that O
's O
at O
an O
end O
in O
the O
middle O
, O
and O
at O
the O
beginning O
at O
the O
end O
. O
It O
's O
the O
old O
woman O
's O
tricks O
to O
be O
giving O
cobbling O
jobs O
. O
Lord O
! O
what O
an O
affection O
all O
old O
women O
have O
for O
tinkers O
. O
I O
know O
an O
old O
woman O
of O
sixty-five O
who O
ran O
away O
with O
a O
bald-headed O
young O
tinker O
once O
. O
And O
that O
's O
the O
reason O
I O
never O
would O
work O
for O
lonely O
widow O
old O
women O
ashore O
, O
when O
I O
kept O
my O
job-shop O
in O
the O
Vineyard O
; O
they O
might O
have O
taken O
it O
into O
their O
lonely O
old O
heads O
to O
run O
off O
with O
me O
. O
But O
heigh-ho O
! O
there O
are O
no O
caps O
at O
sea O
but O
snow-caps O
. O
Let O
me O
see O
. O
Nail O
down O
the O
lid O
; O
caulk O
the O
seams O
; O
pay O
over O
the O
same O
with O
pitch O
; O
batten O
them O
down O
tight O
, O
and O
hang O
it O
with O
the O
snap-spring O
over O
the O
ship O
's O
stern O
. O
Were O
ever O
such O
things O
done O
before O
with O
a O
coffin O
? O
Some O
superstitious O
old O
carpenters O
, O
now O
, O
would O
be O
tied O
up O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
ere O
they O
would O
do O
the O
job O
. O
But O
I O
'm O
made O
of O
knotty O
Aroostook O
hemlock O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
budge O
. O
Cruppered O
with O
a O
coffin O
! O
Sailing O
about O
with O
a O
grave-yard O
tray O
! O
But O
never O
mind O
. O
We O
workers O
in O
woods O
make O
bridal-bedsteads O
and O
card-tables O
, O
as O
well O
as O
coffins O
and O
hearses O
. O
We O
work O
by O
the O
month O
, O
or O
by O
the O
job O
, O
or O
by O
the O
profit O
; O
not O
for O
us O
to O
ask O
the O
why O
and O
wherefore O
of O
our O
work O
, O
unless O
it O
be O
too O
confounded O
cobbling O
, O
and O
then O
we O
stash O
it O
if O
we O
can O
. O
Hem O
! O
I O
'll O
do O
the O
job O
, O
now O
, O
tenderly O
. O
I O
'll O
have O
me—let O
's O
see—how O
many O
in O
the O
ship O
's O
company O
, O
all O
told O
? O
But O
I O
've O
forgotten O
. O
Any O
way O
, O
I O
'll O
have O
me O
thirty O
separate O
, O
Turk's-headed O
life-lines O
, O
each O
three O
feet O
long O
hanging O
all O
round O
to O
the O
coffin O
. O
Then O
, O
if O
the O
hull O
go O
down O
, O
there O
'll O
be O
thirty O
lively O
fellows O
all O
fighting O
for O
one O
coffin O
, O
a O
sight O
not O
seen O
very O
often O

the O
sun O
