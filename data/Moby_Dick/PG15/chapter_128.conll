Next O
day O
, O
a O
large O
ship O
, O
the O
Rachel O
, O
was O
descried O
, O
bearing O
directly O
down O
upon O
the O
Pequod O
, O
all O
her O
spars O
thickly O
clustering O
with O
men O
. O
At O
the O
time O
the O
Pequod O
was O
making O
good O
speed O
through O
the O
water O
; O
but O
as O
the O
broad-winged O
windward O
stranger O
shot O
nigh O
to O
her O
, O
the O
boastful O
sails O
all O
fell O
together O
as O
blank O
bladders O
that O
are O
burst O
, O
and O
all O
life O
fled O
from O
the O
smitten O
hull O
. O
" O
Bad O
news O
; O
she O
brings O
bad O
news O
, O
" O
muttered O
the O
old O
Manxman O
. O
But O
ere O
her O
commander O
, O
who O
, O
with O
trumpet O
to O
mouth O
, O
stood O
up O
in O
his O
boat O
; O
ere O
he O
could O
hopefully O
hail O
, O
Ahab O
's O
voice O
was O
heard O
. O
" O
Hast O
seen O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
yesterday O
. O
Have O
ye O
seen O
a O
whale-boat O
adrift O
? O
" O
Throttling O
his O
joy O
, O
Ahab O
negatively O
answered O
this O
unexpected O
question O
; O
and O
would O
then O
have O
fain O
boarded O
the O
stranger O
, O
when O
the O
stranger O
captain O
himself O
, O
having O
stopped O
his O
vessel O
's O
way O
, O
was O
seen O
descending O
her O
side O
. O
A O
few O
keen O
pulls O
, O
and O
his O
boat-hook O
soon O
clinched O
the O
Pequod O
's O
main-chains O
, O
and O
he O
sprang O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
Immediately O
he O
was O
recognized O
by O
Ahab O
for O
a O
Nantucketer O
he O
knew O
. O
But O
no O
formal O
salutation O
was O
exchanged O
. O
" O
Where O
was O
he O
? O
—not O
killed O
! O
—not O
killed O
! O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
closely O
advancing O
. O
" O
How O
was O
it O
? O
" O
It O
seemed O
that O
somewhat O
late O
on O
the O
afternoon O
of O
the O
day O
previous O
, O
while O
three O
of O
the O
stranger O
's O
boats O
were O
engaged O
with O
a O
shoal O
of O
whales O
, O
which O
had O
led O
them O
some O
four O
or O
five O
miles O
from O
the O
ship O
; O
and O
while O
they O
were O
yet O
in O
swift O
chase O
to O
windward O
, O
the O
white O
hump O
and O
head O
of O
Moby O
Dick O
had O
suddenly O
loomed O
up O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
water O
, O
not O
very O
far O
to O
leeward O
; O
whereupon O
, O
the O
fourth O
rigged O
boat—a O
reserved O
one—had O
been O
instantly O
lowered O
in O
chase O
. O
After O
a O
keen O
sail O
before O
the O
wind O
, O
this O
fourth O
boat—the O
swiftest O
keeled O
of O
all—seemed O
to O
have O
succeeded O
in O
fastening—at O
least O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
man O
at O
the O
mast-head O
could O
tell O
anything O
about O
it O
. O
In O
the O
distance O
he O
saw O
the O
diminished O
dotted O
boat O
; O
and O
then O
a O
swift O
gleam O
of O
bubbling O
white O
water O
; O
and O
after O
that O
nothing O
more O
; O
whence O
it O
was O
concluded O
that O
the O
stricken O
whale O
must O
have O
indefinitely O
run O
away O
with O
his O
pursuers O
, O
as O
often O
happens O
. O
There O
was O
some O
apprehension O
, O
but O
no O
positive O
alarm O
, O
as O
yet O
. O
The O
recall O
signals O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
rigging O
; O
darkness O
came O
on O
; O
and O
forced O
to O
pick O
up O
her O
three O
far O
to O
windward O
boats—ere O
going O
in O
quest O
of O
the O
fourth O
one O
in O
the O
precisely O
opposite O
direction—the O
ship O
had O
not O
only O
been O
necessitated O
to O
leave O
that O
boat O
to O
its O
fate O
till O
near O
midnight O
, O
but O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
to O
increase O
her O
distance O
from O
it O
. O
But O
the O
rest O
of O
her O
crew O
being O
at O
last O
safe O
aboard O
, O
she O
crowded O
all O
sail—stunsail O
on O
stunsail—after O
the O
missing O
boat O
; O
kindling O
a O
fire O
in O
her O
try-pots O
for O
a O
beacon O
; O
and O
every O
other O
man O
aloft O
on O
the O
look-out O
. O
But O
though O
when O
she O
had O
thus O
sailed O
a O
sufficient O
distance O
to O
gain O
the O
presumed O
place O
of O
the O
absent O
ones O
when O
last O
seen O
; O
though O
she O
then O
paused O
to O
lower O
her O
spare O
boats O
to O
pull O
all O
around O
her O
; O
and O
not O
finding O
anything O
, O
had O
again O
dashed O
on O
; O
again O
paused O
, O
and O
lowered O
her O
boats O
; O
and O
though O
she O
had O
thus O
continued O
doing O
till O
day O
light O
; O
yet O
not O
the O
least O
glimpse O
of O
the O
missing O
keel O
had O
been O
seen O
. O
The O
story O
told O
, O
the O
stranger O
Captain O
immediately O
went O
on O
to O
reveal O
his O
object O
in O
boarding O
the O
Pequod O
. O
He O
desired O
that O
ship O
to O
unite O
with O
his O
own O
in O
the O
search O
; O
by O
sailing O
over O
the O
sea O
some O
four O
or O
five O
miles O
apart O
, O
on O
parallel O
lines O
, O
and O
so O
sweeping O
a O
double O
horizon O
, O
as O
it O
were O
. O
" O
I O
will O
wager O
something O
now O
, O
" O
whispered O
Stubb O
to O
Flask O
, O
" O
that O
some O
one O
in O
that O
missing O
boat O
wore O
off O
that O
Captain O
's O
best O
coat O
; O
mayhap O
, O
his O
watch—he O
's O
so O
cursed O
anxious O
to O
get O
it O
back O
. O
Who O
ever O
heard O
of O
two O
pious O
whale-ships O
cruising O
after O
one O
missing O
whale-boat O
in O
the O
height O
of O
the O
whaling O
season O
? O
See O
, O
Flask O
, O
only O
see O
how O
pale O
he O
looks—pale O
in O
the O
very O
buttons O
of O
his O
eyes—look—it O
was O
n't O
the O
coat—it O
must O
have O
been O
the— O
" O
" O
My O
boy O
, O
my O
own O
boy O
is O
among O
them O
. O
For O
God O
's O
sake—I O
beg O
, O
I O
conjure O
" O
—here O
exclaimed O
the O
stranger O
Captain O
to O
Ahab O
, O
who O
thus O
far O
had O
but O
icily O
received O
his O
petition O
. O
" O
For O
eight-and-forty O
hours O
let O
me O
charter O
your O
ship—I O
will O
gladly O
pay O
for O
it O
, O
and O
roundly O
pay O
for O
it—if O
there O
be O
no O
other O
way—for O
eight-and-forty O
hours O
only—only O
that—you O
must O
, O
oh O
, O
you O
must O
, O
and O
you O
_shall_ O
do O
this O
thing O
. O
" O
" O
His O
son O
! O
" O
cried O
Stubb O
, O
" O
oh O
, O
it O
's O
his O
son O
he O
's O
lost O
! O
I O
take O
back O
the O
coat O
and O
watch—what O
says O
Ahab O
? O
We O
must O
save O
that O
boy O
. O
" O
" O
He O
's O
drowned O
with O
the O
rest O
on O
'em O
, O
last O
night O
, O
" O
said O
the O
old O
Manx O
sailor O
standing O
behind O
them O
; O
" O
I O
heard O
; O
all O
of O
ye O
heard O
their O
spirits O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
as O
it O
shortly O
turned O
out O
, O
what O
made O
this O
incident O
of O
the O
Rachel O
's O
the O
more O
melancholy O
, O
was O
the O
circumstance O
, O
that O
not O
only O
was O
one O
of O
the O
Captain O
's O
sons O
among O
the O
number O
of O
the O
missing O
boat O
's O
crew O
; O
but O
among O
the O
number O
of O
the O
other O
boat O
's O
crews O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
separated O
from O
the O
ship O
during O
the O
dark O
vicissitudes O
of O
the O
chase O
, O
there O
had O
been O
still O
another O
son O
; O
as O
that O
for O
a O
time O
, O
the O
wretched O
father O
was O
plunged O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
cruellest O
perplexity O
; O
which O
was O
only O
solved O
for O
him O
by O
his O
chief O
mate O
's O
instinctively O
adopting O
the O
ordinary O
procedure O
of O
a O
whale-ship O
in O
such O
emergencies O
, O
that O
is O
, O
when O
placed O
between O
jeopardized O
but O
divided O
boats O
, O
always O
to O
pick O
up O
the O
majority O
first O
. O
But O
the O
captain O
, O
for O
some O
unknown O
constitutional O
reason O
, O
had O
refrained O
from O
mentioning O
all O
this O
, O
and O
not O
till O
forced O
to O
it O
by O
Ahab O
's O
iciness O
did O
he O
allude O
to O
his O
one O
yet O
missing O
boy O
; O
a O
little O
lad O
, O
but O
twelve O
years O
old O
, O
whose O
father O
with O
the O
earnest O
but O
unmisgiving O
hardihood O
of O
a O
Nantucketer O
's O
paternal O
love O
, O
had O
thus O
early O
sought O
to O
initiate O
him O
in O
the O
perils O
and O
wonders O
of O
a O
vocation O
almost O
immemorially O
the O
destiny O
of O
all O
his O
race O
. O
Nor O
does O
it O
unfrequently O
occur O
, O
that O
Nantucket O
captains O
will O
send O
a O
son O
of O
such O
tender O
age O
away O
from O
them O
, O
for O
a O
protracted O
three O
or O
four O
years O
' O
voyage O
in O
some O
other O
ship O
than O
their O
own O
; O
so O
that O
their O
first O
knowledge O
of O
a O
whaleman O
's O
career O
shall O
be O
unenervated O
by O
any O
chance O
display O
of O
a O
father O
's O
natural O
but O
untimely O
partiality O
, O
or O
undue O
apprehensiveness O
and O
concern O
. O
Meantime O
, O
now O
the O
stranger O
was O
still O
beseeching O
his O
poor O
boon O
of O
Ahab O
; O
and O
Ahab O
still O
stood O
like O
an O
anvil O
, O
receiving O
every O
shock O
, O
but O
without O
the O
least O
quivering O
of O
his O
own O
. O
" O
I O
will O
not O
go O
, O
" O
said O
the O
stranger O
, O
" O
till O
you O
say O
_aye_ O
to O
me O
. O
Do O
to O
me O
as O
you O
would O
have O
me O
do O
to O
you O
in O
the O
like O
case O
. O
For O
_you_ O
too O
have O
a O
boy O
, O
Captain O
Ahab—though O
but O
a O
child O
, O
and O
nestling O
safely O
at O
home O
now—a O
child O
of O
your O
old O
age O
too—Yes O
, O
yes O
, O
you O
relent O
; O
I O
see O
it—run O
, O
run O
, O
men O
, O
now O
, O
and O
stand O
by O
to O
square O
in O
the O
yards O
. O
" O
" O
Avast O
, O
" O
cried O
Ahab— O
" O
touch O
not O
a O
rope-yarn O
; O
" O
then O
in O
a O
voice O
that O
prolongingly O
moulded O
every O
word— O
" O
Captain O
Gardiner O
, O
I O
will O
not O
do O
it O
. O
Even O
now O
I O
lose O
time O
. O
Good O
bye O
, O
good O
bye O
. O
God O
bless O
ye O
, O
man O
, O
and O
may O
I O
forgive O
myself O
, O
but O
I O
must O
go O
. O
Mr. O
Starbuck O
, O
look O
at O
the O
binnacle O
watch O
, O
and O
in O
three O
minutes O
from O
this O
present O
instant O
warn O
off O
all O
strangers O
: O
then O
brace O
forward O
again O
, O
and O
let O
the O
ship O
sail O
as O
before O
. O
" O
Hurriedly O
turning O
, O
with O
averted O
face O
, O
he O
descended O
into O
his O
cabin O
, O
leaving O
the O
strange O
captain O
transfixed O
at O
this O
unconditional O
and O
utter O
rejection O
of O
his O
so O
earnest O
suit O
. O
But O
starting O
from O
his O
enchantment O
, O
Gardiner O
silently O
hurried O
to O
the O
side O
; O
more O
fell O
than O
stepped O
into O
his O
boat O
, O
and O
returned O
to O
his O
ship O
. O
Soon O
the O
two O
ships O
diverged O
their O
wakes O
; O
and O
long O
as O
the O
strange O
vessel O
was O
in O
view O
, O
she O
was O
seen O
to O
yaw O
hither O
and O
thither O
at O
every O
dark O
spot O
, O
however O
small O
, O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
This O
way O
and O
that O
her O
yards O
were O
swung O
round O
; O
starboard O
and O
larboard O
, O
she O
continued O
to O
tack O
; O
now O
she O
beat O
against O
a O
head O
sea O
; O
and O
again O
it O
pushed O
her O
before O
it O
; O
while O
all O
the O
while O
, O
her O
masts O
and O
yards O
were O
thickly O
clustered O
with O
men O
, O
as O
three O
tall O
cherry O
trees O
, O
when O
the O
boys O
are O
cherrying O
among O
the O
boughs O
. O
But O
by O
her O
still O
halting O
course O
and O
winding O
, O
woful O
way O
, O
you O
plainly O
saw O
that O
this O
ship O
that O
so O
wept O
with O
spray O
, O
still O
remained O
without O
comfort O
. O
She O
was O
Rachel O
, O
weeping O
for O
her O
children O
, O
because O
they O
were O
not O
. O
