I O
, O
Ishmael O
, O
was O
one O
of O
that O
crew O
; O
my O
shouts O
had O
gone O
up O
with O
the O
rest O
; O
my O
oath O
had O
been O
welded O
with O
theirs O
; O
and O
stronger O
I O
shouted O
, O
and O
more O
did O
I O
hammer O
and O
clinch O
my O
oath O
, O
because O
of O
the O
dread O
in O
my O
soul O
. O
A O
wild O
, O
mystical O
, O
sympathetical O
feeling O
was O
in O
me O
; O
Ahab O
's O
quenchless O
feud O
seemed O
mine O
. O
With O
greedy O
ears O
I O
learned O
the O
history O
of O
that O
murderous O
monster O
against O
whom O
I O
and O
all O
the O
others O
had O
taken O
our O
oaths O
of O
violence O
and O
revenge O
. O
For O
some O
time O
past O
, O
though O
at O
intervals O
only O
, O
the O
unaccompanied O
, O
secluded O
White O
Whale O
had O
haunted O
those O
uncivilized O
seas O
mostly O
frequented O
by O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
fishermen O
. O
But O
not O
all O
of O
them O
knew O
of O
his O
existence O
; O
only O
a O
few O
of O
them O
, O
comparatively O
, O
had O
knowingly O
seen O
him O
; O
while O
the O
number O
who O
as O
yet O
had O
actually O
and O
knowingly O
given O
battle O
to O
him O
, O
was O
small O
indeed O
. O
For O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
large O
number O
of O
whale-cruisers O
; O
the O
disorderly O
way O
they O
were O
sprinkled O
over O
the O
entire O
watery O
circumference O
, O
many O
of O
them O
adventurously O
pushing O
their O
quest O
along O
solitary O
latitudes O
, O
so O
as O
seldom O
or O
never O
for O
a O
whole O
twelvemonth O
or O
more O
on O
a O
stretch O
, O
to O
encounter O
a O
single O
news-telling O
sail O
of O
any O
sort O
; O
the O
inordinate O
length O
of O
each O
separate O
voyage O
; O
the O
irregularity O
of O
the O
times O
of O
sailing O
from O
home O
; O
all O
these O
, O
with O
other O
circumstances O
, O
direct O
and O
indirect O
, O
long O
obstructed O
the O
spread O
through O
the O
whole O
world-wide O
whaling-fleet O
of O
the O
special O
individualizing O
tidings O
concerning O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
It O
was O
hardly O
to O
be O
doubted O
, O
that O
several O
vessels O
reported O
to O
have O
encountered O
, O
at O
such O
or O
such O
a O
time O
, O
or O
on O
such O
or O
such O
a O
meridian O
, O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
of O
uncommon O
magnitude O
and O
malignity O
, O
which O
whale O
, O
after O
doing O
great O
mischief O
to O
his O
assailants O
, O
has O
completely O
escaped O
them O
; O
to O
some O
minds O
it O
was O
not O
an O
unfair O
presumption O
, O
I O
say O
, O
that O
the O
whale O
in O
question O
must O
have O
been O
no O
other O
than O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
Yet O
as O
of O
late O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
fishery O
had O
been O
marked O
by O
various O
and O
not O
unfrequent O
instances O
of O
great O
ferocity O
, O
cunning O
, O
and O
malice O
in O
the O
monster O
attacked O
; O
therefore O
it O
was O
, O
that O
those O
who O
by O
accident O
ignorantly O
gave O
battle O
to O
Moby O
Dick O
; O
such O
hunters O
, O
perhaps O
, O
for O
the O
most O
part O
, O
were O
content O
to O
ascribe O
the O
peculiar O
terror O
he O
bred O
, O
more O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
to O
the O
perils O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
fishery O
at O
large O
, O
than O
to O
the O
individual O
cause O
. O
In O
that O
way O
, O
mostly O
, O
the O
disastrous O
encounter O
between O
Ahab O
and O
the O
whale O
had O
hitherto O
been O
popularly O
regarded O
. O
And O
as O
for O
those O
who O
, O
previously O
hearing O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
, O
by O
chance O
caught O
sight O
of O
him O
; O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
thing O
they O
had O
every O
one O
of O
them O
, O
almost O
, O
as O
boldly O
and O
fearlessly O
lowered O
for O
him O
, O
as O
for O
any O
other O
whale O
of O
that O
species O
. O
But O
at O
length O
, O
such O
calamities O
did O
ensue O
in O
these O
assaults—not O
restricted O
to O
sprained O
wrists O
and O
ankles O
, O
broken O
limbs O
, O
or O
devouring O
amputations—but O
fatal O
to O
the O
last O
degree O
of O
fatality O
; O
those O
repeated O
disastrous O
repulses O
, O
all O
accumulating O
and O
piling O
their O
terrors O
upon O
Moby O
Dick O
; O
those O
things O
had O
gone O
far O
to O
shake O
the O
fortitude O
of O
many O
brave O
hunters O
, O
to O
whom O
the O
story O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
had O
eventually O
come O
. O
Nor O
did O
wild O
rumors O
of O
all O
sorts O
fail O
to O
exaggerate O
, O
and O
still O
the O
more O
horrify O
the O
true O
histories O
of O
these O
deadly O
encounters O
. O
For O
not O
only O
do O
fabulous O
rumors O
naturally O
grow O
out O
of O
the O
very O
body O
of O
all O
surprising O
terrible O
events O
, O
—as O
the O
smitten O
tree O
gives O
birth O
to O
its O
fungi O
; O
but O
, O
in O
maritime O
life O
, O
far O
more O
than O
in O
that O
of O
terra O
firma O
, O
wild O
rumors O
abound O
, O
wherever O
there O
is O
any O
adequate O
reality O
for O
them O
to O
cling O
to O
. O
And O
as O
the O
sea O
surpasses O
the O
land O
in O
this O
matter O
, O
so O
the O
whale O
fishery O
surpasses O
every O
other O
sort O
of O
maritime O
life O
, O
in O
the O
wonderfulness O
and O
fearfulness O
of O
the O
rumors O
which O
sometimes O
circulate O
there O
. O
For O
not O
only O
are O
whalemen O
as O
a O
body O
unexempt O
from O
that O
ignorance O
and O
superstitiousness O
hereditary O
to O
all O
sailors O
; O
but O
of O
all O
sailors O
, O
they O
are O
by O
all O
odds O
the O
most O
directly O
brought O
into O
contact O
with O
whatever O
is O
appallingly O
astonishing O
in O
the O
sea O
; O
face O
to O
face O
they O
not O
only O
eye O
its O
greatest O
marvels O
, O
but O
, O
hand O
to O
jaw O
, O
give O
battle O
to O
them O
. O
Alone O
, O
in O
such O
remotest O
waters O
, O
that O
though O
you O
sailed O
a O
thousand O
miles O
, O
and O
passed O
a O
thousand O
shores O
, O
you O
would O
not O
come O
to O
any O
chiselled O
hearthstone O
, O
or O
aught O
hospitable O
beneath O
that O
part O
of O
the O
sun O
; O
in O
such O
latitudes O
and O
longitudes O
, O
pursuing O
too O
such O
a O
calling O
as O
he O
does O
, O
the O
whaleman O
is O
wrapped O
by O
influences O
all O
tending O
to O
make O
his O
fancy O
pregnant O
with O
many O
a O
mighty O
birth O
. O
No O
wonder O
, O
then O
, O
that O
ever O
gathering O
volume O
from O
the O
mere O
transit O
over O
the O
wildest O
watery O
spaces O
, O
the O
outblown O
rumors O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
did O
in O
the O
end O
incorporate O
with O
themselves O
all O
manner O
of O
morbid O
hints O
, O
and O
half-formed O
foetal O
suggestions O
of O
supernatural O
agencies O
, O
which O
eventually O
invested O
Moby O
Dick O
with O
new O
terrors O
unborrowed O
from O
anything O
that O
visibly O
appears O
. O
So O
that O
in O
many O
cases O
such O
a O
panic O
did O
he O
finally O
strike O
, O
that O
few O
who O
by O
those O
rumors O
, O
at O
least O
, O
had O
heard O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
, O
few O
of O
those O
hunters O
were O
willing O
to O
encounter O
the O
perils O
of O
his O
jaw O
. O
But O
there O
were O
still O
other O
and O
more O
vital O
practical O
influences O
at O
work O
. O
Nor O
even O
at O
the O
present O
day O
has O
the O
original O
prestige O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
as O
fearfully O
distinguished O
from O
all O
other O
species O
of O
the O
leviathan O
, O
died O
out O
of O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
whalemen O
as O
a O
body O
. O
There O
are O
those O
this O
day O
among O
them O
, O
who O
, O
though O
intelligent O
and O
courageous O
enough O
in O
offering O
battle O
to O
the O
Greenland O
or O
Right O
whale O
, O
would O
perhaps—either O
from O
professional O
inexperience O
, O
or O
incompetency O
, O
or O
timidity O
, O
decline O
a O
contest O
with O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
; O
at O
any O
rate O
, O
there O
are O
plenty O
of O
whalemen O
, O
especially O
among O
those O
whaling O
nations O
not O
sailing O
under O
the O
American O
flag O
, O
who O
have O
never O
hostilely O
encountered O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
but O
whose O
sole O
knowledge O
of O
the O
leviathan O
is O
restricted O
to O
the O
ignoble O
monster O
primitively O
pursued O
in O
the O
North O
; O
seated O
on O
their O
hatches O
, O
these O
men O
will O
hearken O
with O
a O
childish O
fireside O
interest O
and O
awe O
, O
to O
the O
wild O
, O
strange O
tales O
of O
Southern O
whaling O
. O
Nor O
is O
the O
preeminent O
tremendousness O
of O
the O
great O
Sperm O
Whale O
anywhere O
more O
feelingly O
comprehended O
, O
than O
on O
board O
of O
those O
prows O
which O
stem O
him O
. O
And O
as O
if O
the O
now O
tested O
reality O
of O
his O
might O
had O
in O
former O
legendary O
times O
thrown O
its O
shadow O
before O
it O
; O
we O
find O
some O
book O
naturalists—Olassen O
and O
Povelson—declaring O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
not O
only O
to O
be O
a O
consternation O
to O
every O
other O
creature O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
but O
also O
to O
be O
so O
incredibly O
ferocious O
as O
continually O
to O
be O
athirst O
for O
human O
blood O
. O
Nor O
even O
down O
to O
so O
late O
a O
time O
as O
Cuvier O
's O
, O
were O
these O
or O
almost O
similar O
impressions O
effaced O
. O
For O
in O
his O
Natural O
History O
, O
the O
Baron O
himself O
affirms O
that O
at O
sight O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
all O
fish O
( O
sharks O
included O
) O
are O
" O
struck O
with O
the O
most O
lively O
terrors O
, O
" O
and O
" O
often O
in O
the O
precipitancy O
of O
their O
flight O
dash O
themselves O
against O
the O
rocks O
with O
such O
violence O
as O
to O
cause O
instantaneous O
death O
. O
" O
And O
however O
the O
general O
experiences O
in O
the O
fishery O
may O
amend O
such O
reports O
as O
these O
; O
yet O
in O
their O
full O
terribleness O
, O
even O
to O
the O
bloodthirsty O
item O
of O
Povelson O
, O
the O
superstitious O
belief O
in O
them O
is O
, O
in O
some O
vicissitudes O
of O
their O
vocation O
, O
revived O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
hunters O
. O
So O
that O
overawed O
by O
the O
rumors O
and O
portents O
concerning O
him O
, O
not O
a O
few O
of O
the O
fishermen O
recalled O
, O
in O
reference O
to O
Moby O
Dick O
, O
the O
earlier O
days O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
fishery O
, O
when O
it O
was O
oftentimes O
hard O
to O
induce O
long O
practised O
Right O
whalemen O
to O
embark O
in O
the O
perils O
of O
this O
new O
and O
daring O
warfare O
; O
such O
men O
protesting O
that O
although O
other O
leviathans O
might O
be O
hopefully O
pursued O
, O
yet O
to O
chase O
and O
point O
lances O
at O
such O
an O
apparition O
as O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
was O
not O
for O
mortal O
man O
. O
That O
to O
attempt O
it O
, O
would O
be O
inevitably O
to O
be O
torn O
into O
a O
quick O
eternity O
. O
On O
this O
head O
, O
there O
are O
some O
remarkable O
documents O
that O
may O
be O
consulted O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
some O
there O
were O
, O
who O
even O
in O
the O
face O
of O
these O
things O
were O
ready O
to O
give O
chase O
to O
Moby O
Dick O
; O
and O
a O
still O
greater O
number O
who O
, O
chancing O
only O
to O
hear O
of O
him O
distantly O
and O
vaguely O
, O
without O
the O
specific O
details O
of O
any O
certain O
calamity O
, O
and O
without O
superstitious O
accompaniments O
, O
were O
sufficiently O
hardy O
not O
to O
flee O
from O
the O
battle O
if O
offered O
. O
One O
of O
the O
wild O
suggestions O
referred O
to O
, O
as O
at O
last O
coming O
to O
be O
linked O
with O
the O
White O
Whale O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
superstitiously O
inclined O
, O
was O
the O
unearthly O
conceit O
that O
Moby O
Dick O
was O
ubiquitous O
; O
that O
he O
had O
actually O
been O
encountered O
in O
opposite O
latitudes O
at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
instant O
of O
time O
. O
Nor O
, O
credulous O
as O
such O
minds O
must O
have O
been O
, O
was O
this O
conceit O
altogether O
without O
some O
faint O
show O
of O
superstitious O
probability O
. O
For O
as O
the O
secrets O
of O
the O
currents O
in O
the O
seas O
have O
never O
yet O
been O
divulged O
, O
even O
to O
the O
most O
erudite O
research O
; O
so O
the O
hidden O
ways O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
when O
beneath O
the O
surface O
remain O
, O
in O
great O
part O
, O
unaccountable O
to O
his O
pursuers O
; O
and O
from O
time O
to O
time O
have O
originated O
the O
most O
curious O
and O
contradictory O
speculations O
regarding O
them O
, O
especially O
concerning O
the O
mystic O
modes O
whereby O
, O
after O
sounding O
to O
a O
great O
depth O
, O
he O
transports O
himself O
with O
such O
vast O
swiftness O
to O
the O
most O
widely O
distant O
points O
. O
It O
is O
a O
thing O
well O
known O
to O
both O
American O
and O
English O
whale-ships O
, O
and O
as O
well O
a O
thing O
placed O
upon O
authoritative O
record O
years O
ago O
by O
Scoresby O
, O
that O
some O
whales O
have O
been O
captured O
far O
north O
in O
the O
Pacific O
, O
in O
whose O
bodies O
have O
been O
found O
the O
barbs O
of O
harpoons O
darted O
in O
the O
Greenland O
seas O
. O
Nor O
is O
it O
to O
be O
gainsaid O
, O
that O
in O
some O
of O
these O
instances O
it O
has O
been O
declared O
that O
the O
interval O
of O
time O
between O
the O
two O
assaults O
could O
not O
have O
exceeded O
very O
many O
days O
. O
Hence O
, O
by O
inference O
, O
it O
has O
been O
believed O
by O
some O
whalemen O
, O
that O
the O
Nor O
' O
West O
Passage O
, O
so O
long O
a O
problem O
to O
man O
, O
was O
never O
a O
problem O
to O
the O
whale O
. O
So O
that O
here O
, O
in O
the O
real O
living O
experience O
of O
living O
men O
, O
the O
prodigies O
related O
in O
old O
times O
of O
the O
inland O
Strello O
mountain O
in O
Portugal O
( O
near O
whose O
top O
there O
was O
said O
to O
be O
a O
lake O
in O
which O
the O
wrecks O
of O
ships O
floated O
up O
to O
the O
surface O
) O
; O
and O
that O
still O
more O
wonderful O
story O
of O
the O
Arethusa O
fountain O
near O
Syracuse O
( O
whose O
waters O
were O
believed O
to O
have O
come O
from O
the O
Holy O
Land O
by O
an O
underground O
passage O
) O
; O
these O
fabulous O
narrations O
are O
almost O
fully O
equalled O
by O
the O
realities O
of O
the O
whalemen O
. O
Forced O
into O
familiarity O
, O
then O
, O
with O
such O
prodigies O
as O
these O
; O
and O
knowing O
that O
after O
repeated O
, O
intrepid O
assaults O
, O
the O
White O
Whale O
had O
escaped O
alive O
; O
it O
can O
not O
be O
much O
matter O
of O
surprise O
that O
some O
whalemen O
should O
go O
still O
further O
in O
their O
superstitions O
; O
declaring O
Moby O
Dick O
not O
only O
ubiquitous O
, O
but O
immortal O
( O
for O
immortality O
is O
but O
ubiquity O
in O
time O
) O
; O
that O
though O
groves O
of O
spears O
should O
be O
planted O
in O
his O
flanks O
, O
he O
would O
still O
swim O
away O
unharmed O
; O
or O
if O
indeed O
he O
should O
ever O
be O
made O
to O
spout O
thick O
blood O
, O
such O
a O
sight O
would O
be O
but O
a O
ghastly O
deception O
; O
for O
again O
in O
unensanguined O
billows O
hundreds O
of O
leagues O
away O
, O
his O
unsullied O
jet O
would O
once O
more O
be O
seen O
. O
But O
even O
stripped O
of O
these O
supernatural O
surmisings O
, O
there O
was O
enough O
in O
the O
earthly O
make O
and O
incontestable O
character O
of O
the O
monster O
to O
strike O
the O
imagination O
with O
unwonted O
power O
. O
For O
, O
it O
was O
not O
so O
much O
his O
uncommon O
bulk O
that O
so O
much O
distinguished O
him O
from O
other O
sperm O
whales O
, O
but O
, O
as O
was O
elsewhere O
thrown O
out—a O
peculiar O
snow-white O
wrinkled O
forehead O
, O
and O
a O
high O
, O
pyramidical O
white O
hump O
. O
These O
were O
his O
prominent O
features O
; O
the O
tokens O
whereby O
, O
even O
in O
the O
limitless O
, O
uncharted O
seas O
, O
he O
revealed O
his O
identity O
, O
at O
a O
long O
distance O
, O
to O
those O
who O
knew O
him O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
his O
body O
was O
so O
streaked O
, O
and O
spotted O
, O
and O
marbled O
with O
the O
same O
shrouded O
hue O
, O
that O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
he O
had O
gained O
his O
distinctive O
appellation O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
; O
a O
name O
, O
indeed O
, O
literally O
justified O
by O
his O
vivid O
aspect O
, O
when O
seen O
gliding O
at O
high O
noon O
through O
a O
dark O
blue O
sea O
, O
leaving O
a O
milky-way O
wake O
of O
creamy O
foam O
, O
all O
spangled O
with O
golden O
gleamings O
. O
Nor O
was O
it O
his O
unwonted O
magnitude O
, O
nor O
his O
remarkable O
hue O
, O
nor O
yet O
his O
deformed O
lower O
jaw O
, O
that O
so O
much O
invested O
the O
whale O
with O
natural O
terror O
, O
as O
that O
unexampled O
, O
intelligent O
malignity O
which O
, O
according O
to O
specific O
accounts O
, O
he O
had O
over O
and O
over O
again O
evinced O
in O
his O
assaults O
. O
More O
than O
all O
, O
his O
treacherous O
retreats O
struck O
more O
of O
dismay O
than O
perhaps O
aught O
else O
. O
For O
, O
when O
swimming O
before O
his O
exulting O
pursuers O
, O
with O
every O
apparent O
symptom O
of O
alarm O
, O
he O
had O
several O
times O
been O
known O
to O
turn O
around O
suddenly O
, O
and O
, O
bearing O
down O
upon O
them O
, O
either O
stave O
their O
boats O
to O
splinters O
, O
or O
drive O
them O
back O
in O
consternation O
to O
their O
ship O
. O
Already O
several O
fatalities O
had O
attended O
his O
chase O
. O
But O
though O
similar O
disasters O
, O
however O
little O
bruited O
ashore O
, O
were O
by O
no O
means O
unusual O
in O
the O
fishery O
; O
yet O
, O
in O
most O
instances O
, O
such O
seemed O
the O
White O
Whale O
's O
infernal O
aforethought O
of O
ferocity O
, O
that O
every O
dismembering O
or O
death O
that O
he O
caused O
, O
was O
not O
wholly O
regarded O
as O
having O
been O
inflicted O
by O
an O
unintelligent O
agent O
. O
Judge O
, O
then O
, O
to O
what O
pitches O
of O
inflamed O
, O
distracted O
fury O
the O
minds O
of O
his O
more O
desperate O
hunters O
were O
impelled O
, O
when O
amid O
the O
chips O
of O
chewed O
boats O
, O
and O
the O
sinking O
limbs O
of O
torn O
comrades O
, O
they O
swam O
out O
of O
the O
white O
curds O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
direful O
wrath O
into O
the O
serene O
, O
exasperating O
sunlight O
, O
that O
smiled O
on O
, O
as O
if O
at O
a O
birth O
or O
a O
bridal O
. O
His O
three O
boats O
stove O
around O
him O
, O
and O
oars O
and O
men O
both O
whirling O
in O
the O
eddies O
; O
one O
captain O
, O
seizing O
the O
line-knife O
from O
his O
broken O
prow O
, O
had O
dashed O
at O
the O
whale O
, O
as O
an O
Arkansas O
duellist O
at O
his O
foe O
, O
blindly O
seeking O
with O
a O
six O
inch O
blade O
to O
reach O
the O
fathom-deep O
life O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
That O
captain O
was O
Ahab O
. O
And O
then O
it O
was O
, O
that O
suddenly O
sweeping O
his O
sickle-shaped O
lower O
jaw O
beneath O
him O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
had O
reaped O
away O
Ahab O
's O
leg O
, O
as O
a O
mower O
a O
blade O
of O
grass O
in O
the O
field O
. O
No O
turbaned O
Turk O
, O
no O
hired O
Venetian O
or O
Malay O
, O
could O
have O
smote O
him O
with O
more O
seeming O
malice O
. O
Small O
reason O
was O
there O
to O
doubt O
, O
then O
, O
that O
ever O
since O
that O
almost O
fatal O
encounter O
, O
Ahab O
had O
cherished O
a O
wild O
vindictiveness O
against O
the O
whale O
, O
all O
the O
more O
fell O
for O
that O
in O
his O
frantic O
morbidness O
he O
at O
last O
came O
to O
identify O
with O
him O
, O
not O
only O
all O
his O
bodily O
woes O
, O
but O
all O
his O
intellectual O
and O
spiritual O
exasperations O
. O
The O
White O
Whale O
swam O
before O
him O
as O
the O
monomaniac O
incarnation O
of O
all O
those O
malicious O
agencies O
which O
some O
deep O
men O
feel O
eating O
in O
them O
, O
till O
they O
are O
left O
living O
on O
with O
half O
a O
heart O
and O
half O
a O
lung O
. O
That O
intangible O
malignity O
which O
has O
been O
from O
the O
beginning O
; O
to O
whose O
dominion O
even O
the O
modern O
Christians O
ascribe O
one-half O
of O
the O
worlds O
; O
which O
the O
ancient O
Ophites O
of O
the O
east O
reverenced O
in O
their O
statue O
devil O
; O
—Ahab O
did O
not O
fall O
down O
and O
worship O
it O
like O
them O
; O
but O
deliriously O
transferring O
its O
idea O
to O
the O
abhorred O
white O
whale O
, O
he O
pitted O
himself O
, O
all O
mutilated O
, O
against O
it O
. O
All O
that O
most O
maddens O
and O
torments O
; O
all O
that O
stirs O
up O
the O
lees O
of O
things O
; O
all O
truth O
with O
malice O
in O
it O
; O
all O
that O
cracks O
the O
sinews O
and O
cakes O
the O
brain O
; O
all O
the O
subtle O
demonisms O
of O
life O
and O
thought O
; O
all O
evil O
, O
to O
crazy O
Ahab O
, O
were O
visibly O
personified O
, O
and O
made O
practically O
assailable O
in O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
He O
piled O
upon O
the O
whale O
's O
white O
hump O
the O
sum O
of O
all O
the O
general O
rage O
and O
hate O
felt O
by O
his O
whole O
race O
from O
Adam O
down O
; O
and O
then O
, O
as O
if O
his O
chest O
had O
been O
a O
mortar O
, O
he O
burst O
his O
hot O
heart O
's O
shell O
upon O
it O
. O
It O
is O
not O
probable O
that O
this O
monomania O
in O
him O
took O
its O
instant O
rise O
at O
the O
precise O
time O
of O
his O
bodily O
dismemberment O
. O
Then O
, O
in O
darting O
at O
the O
monster O
, O
knife O
in O
hand O
, O
he O
had O
but O
given O
loose O
to O
a O
sudden O
, O
passionate O
, O
corporal O
animosity O
; O
and O
when O
he O
received O
the O
stroke O
that O
tore O
him O
, O
he O
probably O
but O
felt O
the O
agonizing O
bodily O
laceration O
, O
but O
nothing O
more O
. O
Yet O
, O
when O
by O
this O
collision O
forced O
to O
turn O
towards O
home O
, O
and O
for O
long O
months O
of O
days O
and O
weeks O
, O
Ahab O
and O
anguish O
lay O
stretched O
together O
in O
one O
hammock O
, O
rounding O
in O
mid O
winter O
that O
dreary O
, O
howling O
Patagonian O
Cape O
; O
then O
it O
was O
, O
that O
his O
torn O
body O
and O
gashed O
soul O
bled O
into O
one O
another O
; O
and O
so O
interfusing O
, O
made O
him O
mad O
. O
That O
it O
was O
only O
then O
, O
on O
the O
homeward O
voyage O
, O
after O
the O
encounter O
, O
that O
the O
final O
monomania O
seized O
him O
, O
seems O
all O
but O
certain O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
, O
at O
intervals O
during O
the O
passage O
, O
he O
was O
a O
raving O
lunatic O
; O
and O
, O
though O
unlimbed O
of O
a O
leg O
, O
yet O
such O
vital O
strength O
yet O
lurked O
in O
his O
Egyptian O
chest O
, O
and O
was O
moreover O
intensified O
by O
his O
delirium O
, O
that O
his O
mates O
were O
forced O
to O
lace O
him O
fast O
, O
even O
there O
, O
as O
he O
sailed O
, O
raving O
in O
his O
hammock O
. O
In O
a O
strait-jacket O
, O
he O
swung O
to O
the O
mad O
rockings O
of O
the O
gales O
. O
And O
, O
when O
running O
into O
more O
sufferable O
latitudes O
, O
the O
ship O
, O
with O
mild O
stun'sails O
spread O
, O
floated O
across O
the O
tranquil O
tropics O
, O
and O
, O
to O
all O
appearances O
, O
the O
old O
man O
's O
delirium O
seemed O
left O
behind O
him O
with O
the O
Cape O
Horn O
swells O
, O
and O
he O
came O
forth O
from O
his O
dark O
den O
into O
the O
blessed O
light O
and O
air O
; O
even O
then O
, O
when O
he O
bore O
that O
firm O
, O
collected O
front O
, O
however O
pale O
, O
and O
issued O
his O
calm O
orders O
once O
again O
; O
and O
his O
mates O
thanked O
God O
the O
direful O
madness O
was O
now O
gone O
; O
even O
then O
, O
Ahab O
, O
in O
his O
hidden O
self O
, O
raved O
on O
. O
Human O
madness O
is O
oftentimes O
a O
cunning O
and O
most O
feline O
thing O
. O
When O
you O
think O
it O
fled O
, O
it O
may O
have O
but O
become O
transfigured O
into O
some O
still O
subtler O
form O
. O
Ahab O
's O
full O
lunacy O
subsided O
not O
, O
but O
deepeningly O
contracted O
; O
like O
the O
unabated O
Hudson O
, O
when O
that O
noble O
Northman O
flows O
narrowly O
, O
but O
unfathomably O
through O
the O
Highland O
gorge O
. O
But O
, O
as O
in O
his O
narrow-flowing O
monomania O
, O
not O
one O
jot O
of O
Ahab O
's O
broad O
madness O
had O
been O
left O
behind O
; O
so O
in O
that O
broad O
madness O
, O
not O
one O
jot O
of O
his O
great O
natural O
intellect O
had O
perished O
. O
That O
before O
living O
agent O
, O
now O
became O
the O
living O
instrument O
. O
If O
such O
a O
furious O
trope O
may O
stand O
, O
his O
special O
lunacy O
stormed O
his O
general O
sanity O
, O
and O
carried O
it O
, O
and O
turned O
all O
its O
concentred O
cannon O
upon O
its O
own O
mad O
mark O
; O
so O
that O
far O
from O
having O
lost O
his O
strength O
, O
Ahab O
, O
to O
that O
one O
end O
, O
did O
now O
possess O
a O
thousand O
fold O
more O
potency O
than O
ever O
he O
had O
sanely O
brought O
to O
bear O
upon O
any O
one O
reasonable O
object O
. O
This O
is O
much O
; O
yet O
Ahab O
's O
larger O
, O
darker O
, O
deeper O
part O
remains O
unhinted O
. O
But O
vain O
to O
popularize O
profundities O
, O
and O
all O
truth O
is O
profound O
. O
Winding O
far O
down O
from O
within O
the O
very O
heart O
of O
this O
spiked O
Hotel O
de O
Cluny O
where O
we O
here O
stand—however O
grand O
and O
wonderful O
, O
now O
quit O
it O
; O
—and O
take O
your O
way O
, O
ye O
nobler O
, O
sadder O
souls O
, O
to O
those O
vast O
Roman O
halls O
of O
Thermes O
; O
where O
far O
beneath O
the O
fantastic O
towers O
of O
man O
's O
upper O
earth O
, O
his O
root O
of O
grandeur O
, O
his O
whole O
awful O
essence O
sits O
in O
bearded O
state O
; O
an O
antique O
buried O
beneath O
antiquities O
, O
and O
throned O
on O
torsoes O
! O
So O
with O
a O
broken O
throne O
, O
the O
great O
gods O
mock O
that O
captive O
king O
; O
so O
like O
a O
Caryatid O
, O
he O
patient O
sits O
, O
upholding O
on O
his O
frozen O
brow O
the O
piled O
entablatures O
of O
ages O
. O
Wind O
ye O
down O
there O
, O
ye O
prouder O
, O
sadder O
souls O
! O
question O
that O
proud O
, O
sad O
king O
! O
A O
family O
likeness O
! O
aye O
, O
he O
did O
beget O
ye O
, O
ye O
young O
exiled O
royalties O
; O
and O
from O
your O
grim O
sire O
only O
will O
the O
old O
State-secret O
come O
. O
Now O
, O
in O
his O
heart O
, O
Ahab O
had O
some O
glimpse O
of O
this O
, O
namely O
: O
all O
my O
means O
are O
sane O
, O
my O
motive O
and O
my O
object O
mad O
. O
Yet O
without O
power O
to O
kill O
, O
or O
change O
, O
or O
shun O
the O
fact O
; O
he O
likewise O
knew O
that O
to O
mankind O
he O
did O
now O
long O
dissemble O
; O
in O
some O
sort O
, O
did O
still O
. O
But O
that O
thing O
of O
his O
dissembling O
was O
only O
subject O
to O
his O
perceptibility O
, O
not O
to O
his O
will O
determinate O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
so O
well O
did O
he O
succeed O
in O
that O
dissembling O
, O
that O
when O
with O
ivory O
leg O
he O
stepped O
ashore O
at O
last O
, O
no O
Nantucketer O
thought O
him O
otherwise O
than O
but O
naturally O
grieved O
, O
and O
that O
to O
the O
quick O
, O
with O
the O
terrible O
casualty O
which O
had O
overtaken O
him O
. O
The O
report O
of O
his O
undeniable O
delirium O
at O
sea O
was O
likewise O
popularly O
ascribed O
to O
a O
kindred O
cause O
. O
And O
so O
too O
, O
all O
the O
added O
moodiness O
which O
always O
afterwards O
, O
to O
the O
very O
day O
of O
sailing O
in O
the O
Pequod O
on O
the O
present O
voyage O
, O
sat O
brooding O
on O
his O
brow O
. O
Nor O
is O
it O
so O
very O
unlikely O
, O
that O
far O
from O
distrusting O
his O
fitness O
for O
another O
whaling O
voyage O
, O
on O
account O
of O
such O
dark O
symptoms O
, O
the O
calculating O
people O
of O
that O
prudent O
isle O
were O
inclined O
to O
harbor O
the O
conceit O
, O
that O
for O
those O
very O
reasons O
he O
was O
all O
the O
better O
qualified O
and O
set O
on O
edge O
, O
for O
a O
pursuit O
so O
full O
of O
rage O
and O
wildness O
as O
the O
bloody O
hunt O
of O
whales O
. O
Gnawed O
within O
and O
scorched O
without O
, O
with O
the O
infixed O
, O
unrelenting O
fangs O
of O
some O
incurable O
idea O
; O
such O
an O
one O
, O
could O
he O
be O
found O
, O
would O
seem O
the O
very O
man O
to O
dart O
his O
iron O
and O
lift O
his O
lance O
against O
the O
most O
appalling O
of O
all O
brutes O
. O
Or O
, O
if O
for O
any O
reason O
thought O
to O
be O
corporeally O
incapacitated O
for O
that O
, O
yet O
such O
an O
one O
would O
seem O
superlatively O
competent O
to O
cheer O
and O
howl O
on O
his O
underlings O
to O
the O
attack O
. O
But O
be O
all O
this O
as O
it O
may O
, O
certain O
it O
is O
, O
that O
with O
the O
mad O
secret O
of O
his O
unabated O
rage O
bolted O
up O
and O
keyed O
in O
him O
, O
Ahab O
had O
purposely O
sailed O
upon O
the O
present O
voyage O
with O
the O
one O
only O
and O
all-engrossing O
object O
of O
hunting O
the O
White O
Whale O
. O
Had O
any O
one O
of O
his O
old O
acquaintances O
on O
shore O
but O
half O
dreamed O
of O
what O
was O
lurking O
in O
him O
then O
, O
how O
soon O
would O
their O
aghast O
and O
righteous O
souls O
have O
wrenched O
the O
ship O
from O
