I O
have O
given O
no O
small O
attention O
to O
that O
not O
unvexed O
subject O
, O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
I O
have O
had O
controversies O
about O
it O
with O
experienced O
whalemen O
afloat O
, O
and O
learned O
naturalists O
ashore O
. O
My O
original O
opinion O
remains O
unchanged O
; O
but O
it O
is O
only O
an O
opinion O
. O
The O
question O
is O
, O
what O
and O
where O
is O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
whale O
? O
Already O
you O
know O
what O
his O
blubber O
is O
. O
That O
blubber O
is O
something O
of O
the O
consistence O
of O
firm O
, O
close-grained O
beef O
, O
but O
tougher O
, O
more O
elastic O
and O
compact O
, O
and O
ranges O
from O
eight O
or O
ten O
to O
twelve O
and O
fifteen O
inches O
in O
thickness O
. O
Now O
, O
however O
preposterous O
it O
may O
at O
first O
seem O
to O
talk O
of O
any O
creature O
's O
skin O
as O
being O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
consistence O
and O
thickness O
, O
yet O
in O
point O
of O
fact O
these O
are O
no O
arguments O
against O
such O
a O
presumption O
; O
because O
you O
can O
not O
raise O
any O
other O
dense O
enveloping O
layer O
from O
the O
whale O
's O
body O
but O
that O
same O
blubber O
; O
and O
the O
outermost O
enveloping O
layer O
of O
any O
animal O
, O
if O
reasonably O
dense O
, O
what O
can O
that O
be O
but O
the O
skin O
? O
True O
, O
from O
the O
unmarred O
dead O
body O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
you O
may O
scrape O
off O
with O
your O
hand O
an O
infinitely O
thin O
, O
transparent O
substance O
, O
somewhat O
resembling O
the O
thinnest O
shreds O
of O
isinglass O
, O
only O
it O
is O
almost O
as O
flexible O
and O
soft O
as O
satin O
; O
that O
is O
, O
previous O
to O
being O
dried O
, O
when O
it O
not O
only O
contracts O
and O
thickens O
, O
but O
becomes O
rather O
hard O
and O
brittle O
. O
I O
have O
several O
such O
dried O
bits O
, O
which O
I O
use O
for O
marks O
in O
my O
whale-books O
. O
It O
is O
transparent O
, O
as O
I O
said O
before O
; O
and O
being O
laid O
upon O
the O
printed O
page O
, O
I O
have O
sometimes O
pleased O
myself O
with O
fancying O
it O
exerted O
a O
magnifying O
influence O
. O
At O
any O
rate O
, O
it O
is O
pleasant O
to O
read O
about O
whales O
through O
their O
own O
spectacles O
, O
as O
you O
may O
say O
. O
But O
what O
I O
am O
driving O
at O
here O
is O
this O
. O
That O
same O
infinitely O
thin O
, O
isinglass O
substance O
, O
which O
, O
I O
admit O
, O
invests O
the O
entire O
body O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
is O
not O
so O
much O
to O
be O
regarded O
as O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
creature O
, O
as O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
skin O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
; O
for O
it O
were O
simply O
ridiculous O
to O
say O
, O
that O
the O
proper O
skin O
of O
the O
tremendous O
whale O
is O
thinner O
and O
more O
tender O
than O
the O
skin O
of O
a O
new-born O
child O
. O
But O
no O
more O
of O
this O
. O
Assuming O
the O
blubber O
to O
be O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
whale O
; O
then O
, O
when O
this O
skin O
, O
as O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
very O
large O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
will O
yield O
the O
bulk O
of O
one O
hundred O
barrels O
of O
oil O
; O
and O
, O
when O
it O
is O
considered O
that O
, O
in O
quantity O
, O
or O
rather O
weight O
, O
that O
oil O
, O
in O
its O
expressed O
state O
, O
is O
only O
three O
fourths O
, O
and O
not O
the O
entire O
substance O
of O
the O
coat O
; O
some O
idea O
may O
hence O
be O
had O
of O
the O
enormousness O
of O
that O
animated O
mass O
, O
a O
mere O
part O
of O
whose O
mere O
integument O
yields O
such O
a O
lake O
of O
liquid O
as O
that O
. O
Reckoning O
ten O
barrels O
to O
the O
ton O
, O
you O
have O
ten O
tons O
for O
the O
net O
weight O
of O
only O
three O
quarters O
of O
the O
stuff O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
skin O
. O
In O
life O
, O
the O
visible O
surface O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
not O
the O
least O
among O
the O
many O
marvels O
he O
presents O
. O
Almost O
invariably O
it O
is O
all O
over O
obliquely O
crossed O
and O
re-crossed O
with O
numberless O
straight O
marks O
in O
thick O
array O
, O
something O
like O
those O
in O
the O
finest O
Italian O
line O
engravings O
. O
But O
these O
marks O
do O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
impressed O
upon O
the O
isinglass O
substance O
above O
mentioned O
, O
but O
seem O
to O
be O
seen O
through O
it O
, O
as O
if O
they O
were O
engraved O
upon O
the O
body O
itself O
. O
Nor O
is O
this O
all O
. O
In O
some O
instances O
, O
to O
the O
quick O
, O
observant O
eye O
, O
those O
linear O
marks O
, O
as O
in O
a O
veritable O
engraving O
, O
but O
afford O
the O
ground O
for O
far O
other O
delineations O
. O
These O
are O
hieroglyphical O
; O
that O
is O
, O
if O
you O
call O
those O
mysterious O
cyphers O
on O
the O
walls O
of O
pyramids O
hieroglyphics O
, O
then O
that O
is O
the O
proper O
word O
to O
use O
in O
the O
present O
connexion O
. O
By O
my O
retentive O
memory O
of O
the O
hieroglyphics O
upon O
one O
Sperm O
Whale O
in O
particular O
, O
I O
was O
much O
struck O
with O
a O
plate O
representing O
the O
old O
Indian O
characters O
chiselled O
on O
the O
famous O
hieroglyphic O
palisades O
on O
the O
banks O
of O
the O
Upper O
Mississippi O
. O
Like O
those O
mystic O
rocks O
, O
too O
, O
the O
mystic-marked O
whale O
remains O
undecipherable O
. O
This O
allusion O
to O
the O
Indian O
rocks O
reminds O
me O
of O
another O
thing O
. O
Besides O
all O
the O
other O
phenomena O
which O
the O
exterior O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
presents O
, O
he O
not O
seldom O
displays O
the O
back O
, O
and O
more O
especially O
his O
flanks O
, O
effaced O
in O
great O
part O
of O
the O
regular O
linear O
appearance O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
numerous O
rude O
scratches O
, O
altogether O
of O
an O
irregular O
, O
random O
aspect O
. O
I O
should O
say O
that O
those O
New O
England O
rocks O
on O
the O
sea-coast O
, O
which O
Agassiz O
imagines O
to O
bear O
the O
marks O
of O
violent O
scraping O
contact O
with O
vast O
floating O
icebergs—I O
should O
say O
, O
that O
those O
rocks O
must O
not O
a O
little O
resemble O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
in O
this O
particular O
. O
It O
also O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
such O
scratches O
in O
the O
whale O
are O
probably O
made O
by O
hostile O
contact O
with O
other O
whales O
; O
for O
I O
have O
most O
remarked O
them O
in O
the O
large O
, O
full-grown O
bulls O
of O
the O
species O
. O
A O
word O
or O
two O
more O
concerning O
this O
matter O
of O
the O
skin O
or O
blubber O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
It O
has O
already O
been O
said O
, O
that O
it O
is O
stript O
from O
him O
in O
long O
pieces O
, O
called O
blanket-pieces O
. O
Like O
most O
sea-terms O
, O
this O
one O
is O
very O
happy O
and O
significant O
. O
For O
the O
whale O
is O
indeed O
wrapt O
up O
in O
his O
blubber O
as O
in O
a O
real O
blanket O
or O
counterpane O
; O
or O
, O
still O
better O
, O
an O
Indian O
poncho O
slipt O
over O
his O
head O
, O
and O
skirting O
his O
extremity O
. O
It O
is O
by O
reason O
of O
this O
cosy O
blanketing O
of O
his O
body O
, O
that O
the O
whale O
is O
enabled O
to O
keep O
himself O
comfortable O
in O
all O
weathers O
, O
in O
all O
seas O
, O
times O
, O
and O
tides O
. O
What O
would O
become O
of O
a O
Greenland O
whale O
, O
say O
, O
in O
those O
shuddering O
, O
icy O
seas O
of O
the O
North O
, O
if O
unsupplied O
with O
his O
cosy O
surtout O
? O
True O
, O
other O
fish O
are O
found O
exceedingly O
brisk O
in O
those O
Hyperborean O
waters O
; O
but O
these O
, O
be O
it O
observed O
, O
are O
your O
cold-blooded O
, O
lungless O
fish O
, O
whose O
very O
bellies O
are O
refrigerators O
; O
creatures O
, O
that O
warm O
themselves O
under O
the O
lee O
of O
an O
iceberg O
, O
as O
a O
traveller O
in O
winter O
would O
bask O
before O
an O
inn O
fire O
; O
whereas O
, O
like O
man O
, O
the O
whale O
has O
lungs O
and O
warm O
blood O
. O
Freeze O
his O
blood O
, O
and O
he O
dies O
. O
How O
wonderful O
is O
it O
then—except O
after O
explanation—that O
this O
great O
monster O
, O
to O
whom O
corporeal O
warmth O
is O
as O
indispensable O
as O
it O
is O
to O
man O
; O
how O
wonderful O
that O
he O
should O
be O
found O
at O
home O
, O
immersed O
to O
his O
lips O
for O
life O
in O
those O
Arctic O
waters O
! O
where O
, O
when O
seamen O
fall O
overboard O
, O
they O
are O
sometimes O
found O
, O
months O
afterwards O
, O
perpendicularly O
frozen O
into O
the O
hearts O
of O
fields O
of O
ice O
, O
as O
a O
fly O
is O
found O
glued O
in O
amber O
. O
But O
more O
surprising O
is O
it O
to O
know O
, O
as O
has O
been O
proved O
by O
experiment O
, O
that O
the O
blood O
of O
a O
Polar O
whale O
is O
warmer O
than O
that O
of O
a O
Borneo O
negro O
in O
summer O
. O
It O
does O
seem O
to O
me O
, O
that O
herein O
we O
see O
the O
rare O
virtue O
of O
a O
strong O
individual O
vitality O
, O
and O
the O
rare O
virtue O
of O
thick O
walls O
, O
and O
the O
rare O
virtue O
of O
interior O
spaciousness O
. O
Oh O
, O
man O
! O
admire O
and O
model O
thyself O
after O
the O
whale O
! O
Do O
thou O
, O
too O
, O
remain O
warm O
among O
ice O
. O
Do O
thou O
, O
too O
, O
live O
in O
this O
world O
without O
uling O
of O
it O
. O
Be O
cool O
at O
the O
equator O
; O
keep O
thy O
blood O
fluid O
at O
the O
Pole O
. O
Like O
the O
great O
dome O
of O
St. O
Peter O
's O
, O
and O
like O
the O
great O
whale O
, O
retain O
, O
O O
man O
! O
in O
all O
seasons O
a O
temperature O
of O
thine O
own O
. O
But O
how O
easy O
and O
how O
hopeless O
to O
teach O
these O
fine O
things O
! O
Of O
erections O
, O
how O
few O
are O
domed O
like O
St. O
Peter O
's O
! O
of O
creatures O
, O
how O
few O
vast O
as O
the O
whale O
! O
