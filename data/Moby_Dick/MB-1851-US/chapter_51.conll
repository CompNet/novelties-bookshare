Days O
, O
weeks O
passed O
, O
and O
under O
easy O
sail O
, O
the O
ivory O
Pequod O
had O
slowly O
swept O
across O
four O
several O
cruising-grounds O
; O
that O
off O
the O
Azores O
; O
off O
the O
Cape O
de O
Verdes O
; O
on O
the O
Plate O
( O
so O
called O
) O
, O
being O
off O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
Rio O
de O
la O
Plata O
; O
and O
the O
Carrol O
Ground O
, O
an O
unstaked O
, O
watery O
locality O
, O
southerly O
from O
St. O
Helena O
. O
It O
was O
while O
gliding O
through O
these O
latter O
waters O
that O
one O
serene O
and O
moonlight O
night O
, O
when O
all O
the O
waves O
rolled O
by O
like O
scrolls O
of O
silver O
; O
and O
, O
by O
their O
soft O
, O
suffusing O
seethings O
, O
made O
what O
seemed O
a O
silvery O
silence O
, O
not O
a O
solitude O
: O
on O
such O
a O
silent O
night O
a O
silvery O
jet O
was O
seen O
far O
in O
advance O
of O
the O
white O
bubbles O
at O
the O
bow O
. O
Lit O
up O
by O
the O
moon O
, O
it O
looked O
celestial O
; O
seemed O
some O
plumed O
and O
glittering O
god O
uprising O
from O
the O
sea O
. O
Fedallah O
first O
descried O
this O
jet O
. O
For O
of O
these O
moonlight O
nights O
, O
it O
was O
his O
wont O
to O
mount O
to O
the O
main-mast O
head O
, O
and O
stand O
a O
look-out O
there O
, O
with O
the O
same O
precision O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
day O
. O
And O
yet O
, O
though O
herds O
of O
whales O
were O
seen O
by O
night O
, O
not O
one O
whaleman O
in O
a O
hundred O
would O
venture O
a O
lowering O
for O
them O
. O
You O
may O
think O
with O
what O
emotions O
, O
then O
, O
the O
seamen O
beheld O
this O
old O
Oriental O
perched O
aloft O
at O
such O
unusual O
hours O
; O
his O
turban O
and O
the O
moon O
, O
companions O
in O
one O
sky O
. O
But O
when O
, O
after O
spending O
his O
uniform O
interval O
there O
for O
several O
successive O
nights O
without O
uttering O
a O
single O
sound O
; O
when O
, O
after O
all O
this O
silence O
, O
his O
unearthly O
voice O
was O
heard O
announcing O
that O
silvery O
, O
moon-lit O
jet O
, O
every O
reclining O
mariner O
started O
to O
his O
feet O
as O
if O
some O
winged O
spirit O
had O
lighted O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
and O
hailed O
the O
mortal O
crew O
. O
" O
There O
she O
blows O
! O
" O
Had O
the O
trump O
of O
judgment O
blown O
, O
they O
could O
not O
have O
quivered O
more O
; O
yet O
still O
they O
felt O
no O
terror O
; O
rather O
pleasure O
. O
For O
though O
it O
was O
a O
most O
unwonted O
hour O
, O
yet O
so O
impressive O
was O
the O
cry O
, O
and O
so O
deliriously O
exciting O
, O
that O
almost O
every O
soul O
on O
board O
instinctively O
desired O
a O
lowering O
. O
Walking O
the O
deck O
with O
quick O
, O
side-lunging O
strides O
, O
Ahab O
commanded O
the O
t'gallant O
sails O
and O
royals O
to O
be O
set O
, O
and O
every O
stunsail O
spread O
. O
The O
best O
man O
in O
the O
ship O
must O
take O
the O
helm O
. O
Then O
, O
with O
every O
mast-head O
manned O
, O
the O
piled-up O
craft O
rolled O
down O
before O
the O
wind O
. O
The O
strange O
, O
upheaving O
, O
lifting O
tendency O
of O
the O
taffrail O
breeze O
filling O
the O
hollows O
of O
so O
many O
sails O
, O
made O
the O
buoyant O
, O
hovering O
deck O
to O
feel O
like O
air O
beneath O
the O
feet O
; O
while O
still O
she O
rushed O
along O
, O
as O
if O
two O
antagonistic O
influences O
were O
struggling O
in O
her—one O
to O
mount O
direct O
to O
heaven O
, O
the O
other O
to O
drive O
yawingly O
to O
some O
horizontal O
goal O
. O
And O
had O
you O
watched O
Ahab O
's O
face O
that O
night O
, O
you O
would O
have O
thought O
that O
in O
him O
also O
two O
different O
things O
were O
warring O
. O
While O
his O
one O
live O
leg O
made O
lively O
echoes O
along O
the O
deck O
, O
every O
stroke O
of O
his O
dead O
limb O
sounded O
like O
a O
coffin-tap O
. O
On O
life O
and O
death O
this O
old O
man O
walked O
. O
But O
though O
the O
ship O
so O
swiftly O
sped O
, O
and O
though O
from O
every O
eye O
, O
like O
arrows O
, O
the O
eager O
glances O
shot O
, O
yet O
the O
silvery O
jet O
was O
no O
more O
seen O
that O
night O
. O
Every O
sailor O
swore O
he O
saw O
it O
once O
, O
but O
not O
a O
second O
time O
. O
This O
midnight-spout O
had O
almost O
grown O
a O
forgotten O
thing O
, O
when O
, O
some O
days O
after O
, O
lo O
! O
at O
the O
same O
silent O
hour O
, O
it O
was O
again O
announced O
: O
again O
it O
was O
descried O
by O
all O
; O
but O
upon O
making O
sail O
to O
overtake O
it O
, O
once O
more O
it O
disappeared O
as O
if O
it O
had O
never O
been O
. O
And O
so O
it O
served O
us O
night O
after O
night O
, O
till O
no O
one O
heeded O
it O
but O
to O
wonder O
at O
it O
. O
Mysteriously O
jetted O
into O
the O
clear O
moonlight O
, O
or O
starlight O
, O
as O
the O
case O
might O
be O
; O
disappearing O
again O
for O
one O
whole O
day O
, O
or O
two O
days O
, O
or O
three O
; O
and O
somehow O
seeming O
at O
every O
distinct O
repetition O
to O
be O
advancing O
still O
further O
and O
further O
in O
our O
van O
, O
this O
solitary O
jet O
seemed O
for O
ever O
alluring O
us O
on O
. O
Nor O
with O
the O
immemorial O
superstition O
of O
their O
race O
, O
and O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
preternaturalness O
, O
as O
it O
seemed O
, O
which O
in O
many O
things O
invested O
the O
Pequod O
, O
were O
there O
wanting O
some O
of O
the O
seamen O
who O
swore O
that O
whenever O
and O
wherever O
descried O
; O
at O
however O
remote O
times O
, O
or O
in O
however O
far O
apart O
latitudes O
and O
longitudes O
, O
that O
unnearable O
spout O
was O
cast O
by O
one O
self-same O
whale O
; O
and O
that O
whale O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
For O
a O
time O
, O
there O
reigned O
, O
too O
, O
a O
sense O
of O
peculiar O
dread O
at O
this O
flitting O
apparition O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
treacherously O
beckoning O
us O
on O
and O
on O
, O
in O
order O
that O
the O
monster O
might O
turn O
round O
upon O
us O
, O
and O
rend O
us O
at O
last O
in O
the O
remotest O
and O
most O
savage O
seas O
. O
These O
temporary O
apprehensions O
, O
so O
vague O
but O
so O
awful O
, O
derived O
a O
wondrous O
potency O
from O
the O
contrasting O
serenity O
of O
the O
weather O
, O
in O
which O
, O
beneath O
all O
its O
blue O
blandness O
, O
some O
thought O
there O
lurked O
a O
devilish O
charm O
, O
as O
for O
days O
and O
days O
we O
voyaged O
along O
, O
through O
seas O
so O
wearily O
, O
lonesomely O
mild O
, O
that O
all O
space O
, O
in O
repugnance O
to O
our O
vengeful O
errand O
, O
seemed O
vacating O
itself O
of O
life O
before O
our O
urn-like O
prow O
. O
But O
, O
at O
last O
, O
when O
turning O
to O
the O
eastward O
, O
the O
Cape O
winds O
began O
howling O
around O
us O
, O
and O
we O
rose O
and O
fell O
upon O
the O
long O
, O
troubled O
seas O
that O
are O
there O
; O
when O
the O
ivory-tusked O
Pequod O
sharply O
bowed O
to O
the O
blast O
, O
and O
gored O
the O
dark O
waves O
in O
her O
madness O
, O
till O
, O
like O
showers O
of O
silver O
chips O
, O
the O
foam-flakes O
flew O
over O
her O
bulwarks O
; O
then O
all O
this O
desolate O
vacuity O
of O
life O
went O
away O
, O
but O
gave O
place O
to O
sights O
more O
dismal O
than O
before O
. O
Close O
to O
our O
bows O
, O
strange O
forms O
in O
the O
water O
darted O
hither O
and O
thither O
before O
us O
; O
while O
thick O
in O
our O
rear O
flew O
the O
inscrutable O
sea-ravens O
. O
And O
every O
morning O
, O
perched O
on O
our O
stays O
, O
rows O
of O
these O
birds O
were O
seen O
; O
and O
spite O
of O
our O
hootings O
, O
for O
a O
long O
time O
obstinately O
clung O
to O
the O
hemp O
, O
as O
though O
they O
deemed O
our O
ship O
some O
drifting O
, O
uninhabited O
craft O
; O
a O
thing O
appointed O
to O
desolation O
, O
and O
therefore O
fit O
roosting-place O
for O
their O
homeless O
selves O
. O
And O
heaved O
and O
heaved O
, O
still O
unrestingly O
heaved O
the O
black O
sea O
, O
as O
if O
its O
vast O
tides O
were O
a O
conscience O
; O
and O
the O
great O
mundane O
soul O
were O
in O
anguish O
and O
remorse O
for O
the O
long O
sin O
and O
suffering O
it O
had O
bred O
. O
Cape O
of O
Good O
Hope O
, O
do O
they O
call O
ye O
? O
Rather O
Cape O
Tormentoto O
, O
as O
called O
of O
yore O
; O
for O
long O
allured O
by O
the O
perfidious O
silences O
that O
before O
had O
attended O
us O
, O
we O
found O
ourselves O
launched O
into O
this O
tormented O
sea O
, O
where O
guilty O
beings O
transformed O
into O
those O
fowls O
and O
these O
fish O
, O
seemed O
condemned O
to O
swim O
on O
everlastingly O
without O
any O
haven O
in O
store O
, O
or O
beat O
that O
black O
air O
without O
any O
horizon O
. O
But O
calm O
, O
snow-white O
, O
and O
unvarying O
; O
still O
directing O
its O
fountain O
of O
feathers O
to O
the O
sky O
; O
still O
beckoning O
us O
on O
from O
before O
, O
the O
solitary O
jet O
would O
at O
times O
be O
descried O
. O
During O
all O
this O
blackness O
of O
the O
elements O
, O
Ahab O
, O
though O
assuming O
for O
the O
time O
the O
almost O
continual O
command O
of O
the O
drenched O
and O
dangerous O
deck O
, O
manifested O
the O
gloomiest O
reserve O
; O
and O
more O
seldom O
than O
ever O
addressed O
his O
mates O
. O
In O
tempestuous O
times O
like O
these O
, O
after O
everything O
above O
and O
aloft O
has O
been O
secured O
, O
nothing O
more O
can O
be O
done O
but O
passively O
to O
await O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
gale O
. O
Then O
Captain O
and O
crew O
become O
practical O
fatalists O
. O
So O
, O
with O
his O
ivory O
leg O
inserted O
into O
its O
accustomed O
hole O
, O
and O
with O
one O
hand O
firmly O
grasping O
a O
shroud O
, O
Ahab O
for O
hours O
and O
hours O
would O
stand O
gazing O
dead O
to O
windward O
, O
while O
an O
occasional O
squall O
of O
sleet O
or O
snow O
would O
all O
but O
congeal O
his O
very O
eyelashes O
together O
. O
Meantime O
, O
the O
crew O
driven O
from O
the O
forward O
part O
of O
the O
ship O
by O
the O
perilous O
seas O
that O
burstingly O
broke O
over O
its O
bows O
, O
stood O
in O
a O
line O
along O
the O
bulwarks O
in O
the O
waist O
; O
and O
the O
better O
to O
guard O
against O
the O
leaping O
waves O
, O
each O
man O
had O
slipped O
himself O
into O
a O
sort O
of O
bowline O
secured O
to O
the O
rail O
, O
in O
which O
he O
swung O
as O
in O
a O
loosened O
belt O
. O
Few O
or O
no O
words O
were O
spoken O
; O
and O
the O
silent O
ship O
, O
as O
if O
manned O
by O
painted O
sailors O
in O
wax O
, O
day O
after O
day O
tore O
on O
through O
all O
the O
swift O
madness O
and O
gladness O
of O
the O
demoniac O
waves O
. O
By O
night O
the O
same O
muteness O
of O
humanity O
before O
the O
shrieks O
of O
the O
ocean O
prevailed O
; O
still O
in O
silence O
the O
men O
swung O
in O
the O
bowlines O
; O
still O
wordless O
Ahab O
stood O
up O
to O
the O
blast O
. O
Even O
when O
wearied O
nature O
seemed O
demanding O
repose O
he O
would O
not O
seek O
that O
repose O
in O
his O
hammock O
. O
Never O
could O
Starbuck O
forget O
the O
old O
man O
's O
aspect O
, O
when O
one O
night O
going O
down O
into O
the O
cabin O
to O
mark O
how O
the O
barometer O
stood O
, O
he O
saw O
him O
with O
closed O
eyes O
sitting O
straight O
in O
his O
floor-screwed O
chair O
; O
the O
rain O
, O
and O
half-melted O
sleet O
of O
the O
storm O
from O
which O
he O
had O
some O
time O
before O
emerged O
, O
still O
slowly O
dripping O
from O
the O
unremoved O
hat O
and O
coat O
. O
On O
the O
table O
beside O
him O
lay O
unrolled O
one O
of O
those O
charts O
of O
tides O
and O
currents O
which O
have O
previously O
been O
spoken O
of O
. O
His O
lantern O
swung O
from O
his O
tightly O
clenched O
hand O
. O
Though O
the O
body O
was O
erect O
, O
the O
head O
was O
thrown O
back O
so O
that O
the O
closed O
eyes O
were O
pointed O
towards O
the O
needle O
of O
the O
tell-tale O
that O
swung O
from O
a O
beam O
in O
the O
ceiling O
. O
[ O

Terrible O
old O
man O
! O
thought O
Starbuck O
with O
a O
shudder O
, O
sleeping O
in O
this O
gale O

still O

steadfastly O

thy O

The O

the O
tell-tale O
