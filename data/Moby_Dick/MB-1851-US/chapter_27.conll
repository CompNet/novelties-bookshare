Stubb O
was O
the O
second O
mate O
. O
He O
was O
a O
native O
of O
Cape O
Cod O
; O
and O
hence O
, O
according O
to O
local O
usage O
, O
was O
called O
a O
Cape-Cod-man O
. O
A O
happy-go-lucky O
; O
neither O
craven O
nor O
valiant O
; O
taking O
perils O
as O
they O
came O
with O
an O
indifferent O
air O
; O
and O
while O
engaged O
in O
the O
most O
imminent O
crisis O
of O
the O
chase O
, O
toiling O
away O
, O
calm O
and O
collected O
as O
a O
journeyman O
joiner O
engaged O
for O
the O
year O
. O
Good-humored O
, O
easy O
, O
and O
careless O
, O
he O
presided O
over O
his O
whaleboat O
as O
if O
the O
most O
deadly O
encounter O
were O
but O
a O
dinner O
, O
and O
his O
crew O
all O
invited O
guests O
. O
He O
was O
as O
particular O
about O
the O
comfortable O
arrangements O
of O
his O
part O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
as O
an O
old O
stage-driver O
is O
about O
the O
snugness O
of O
his O
box O
. O
When O
close O
to O
the O
whale O
, O
in O
the O
very O
death-lock O
of O
the O
fight O
, O
he O
handled O
his O
unpitying O
lance O
coolly O
and O
off-handedly O
, O
as O
a O
whistling O
tinker O
his O
hammer O
. O
He O
would O
hum O
over O
his O
old O
rigadig O
tunes O
while O
flank O
and O
flank O
with O
the O
most O
exasperated O
monster O
. O
Long O
usage O
had O
, O
for O
this O
Stubb O
, O
converted O
the O
jaws O
of O
death O
into O
an O
easy O
chair O
. O
What O
he O
thought O
of O
death O
itself O
, O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
. O
Whether O
he O
ever O
thought O
of O
it O
at O
all O
, O
might O
be O
a O
question O
; O
but O
, O
if O
he O
ever O
did O
chance O
to O
cast O
his O
mind O
that O
way O
after O
a O
comfortable O
dinner O
, O
no O
doubt O
, O
like O
a O
good O
sailor O
, O
he O
took O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sort O
of O
call O
of O
the O
watch O
to O
tumble O
aloft O
, O
and O
bestir O
themselves O
there O
, O
about O
something O
which O
he O
would O
find O
out O
when O
he O
obeyed O
the O
order O
, O
and O
not O
sooner O
. O
What O
, O
perhaps O
, O
with O
other O
things O
, O
made O
Stubb O
such O
an O
easy-going O
, O
unfearing O
man O
, O
so O
cheerily O
trudging O
off O
with O
the O
burden O
of O
life O
in O
a O
world O
full O
of O
grave O
peddlers O
, O
all O
bowed O
to O
the O
ground O
with O
their O
packs O
; O
what O
helped O
to O
bring O
about O
that O
almost O
impious O
good-humor O
of O
his O
; O
that O
thing O
must O
have O
been O
his O
pipe O
. O
For O
, O
like O
his O
nose O
, O
his O
short O
, O
black O
little O
pipe O
was O
one O
of O
the O
regular O
features O
of O
his O
face O
. O
You O
would O
almost O
as O
soon O
have O
expected O
him O
to O
turn O
out O
of O
his O
bunk O
without O
his O
nose O
as O
without O
his O
pipe O
. O
He O
kept O
a O
whole O
row O
of O
pipes O
there O
ready O
loaded O
, O
stuck O
in O
a O
rack O
, O
within O
easy O
reach O
of O
his O
hand O
; O
and O
, O
whenever O
he O
turned O
in O
, O
he O
smoked O
them O
all O
out O
in O
succession O
, O
lighting O
one O
from O
the O
other O
to O
the O
end O
of O
the O
chapter O
; O
then O
loading O
them O
again O
to O
be O
in O
readiness O
anew O
. O
For O
, O
when O
Stubb O
dressed O
, O
instead O
of O
first O
putting O
his O
legs O
into O
his O
trowsers O
, O
he O
put O
his O
pipe O
into O
his O
mouth O
. O
I O
say O
this O
continual O
smoking O
must O
have O
been O
one O
cause O
, O
at O
least O
, O
of O
his O
peculiar O
disposition O
; O
for O
every O
one O
knows O
that O
this O
earthly O
air O
, O
whether O
ashore O
or O
afloat O
, O
is O
terribly O
infected O
with O
the O
nameless O
miseries O
of O
the O
numberless O
mortals O
who O
have O
died O
exhaling O
it O
; O
and O
as O
in O
time O
of O
the O
cholera O
, O
some O
people O
go O
about O
with O
a O
camphorated O
handkerchief O
to O
their O
mouths O
; O
so O
, O
likewise O
, O
against O
all O
mortal O
tribulations O
, O
Stubb O
's O
tobacco O
smoke O
might O
have O
operated O
as O
a O
sort O
of O
disinfecting O
agent O
. O
The O
third O
mate O
was O
Flask O
, O
a O
native O
of O
Tisbury O
, O
in O
Martha O
's O
Vineyard O
. O
A O
short O
, O
stout O
, O
ruddy O
young O
fellow O
, O
very O
pugnacious O
concerning O
whales O
, O
who O
somehow O
seemed O
to O
think O
that O
the O
great O
Leviathans O
had O
personally O
and O
hereditarily O
affronted O
him O
; O
and O
therefore O
it O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
point O
of O
honor O
with O
him O
, O
to O
destroy O
them O
whenever O
encountered O
. O
So O
utterly O
lost O
was O
he O
to O
all O
sense O
of O
reverence O
for O
the O
many O
marvels O
of O
their O
majestic O
bulk O
and O
mystic O
ways O
; O
and O
so O
dead O
to O
anything O
like O
an O
apprehension O
of O
any O
possible O
danger O
from O
encountering O
them O
; O
that O
in O
his O
poor O
opinion O
, O
the O
wondrous O
whale O
was O
but O
a O
species O
of O
magnified O
mouse O
, O
or O
at O
least O
water-rat O
, O
requiring O
only O
a O
little O
circumvention O
and O
some O
small O
application O
of O
time O
and O
trouble O
in O
order O
to O
kill O
and O
boil O
. O
This O
ignorant O
, O
unconscious O
fearlessness O
of O
his O
made O
him O
a O
little O
waggish O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
whales O
; O
he O
followed O
these O
fish O
for O
the O
fun O
of O
it O
; O
and O
a O
three O
years O
' O
voyage O
round O
Cape O
Horn O
was O
only O
a O
jolly O
joke O
that O
lasted O
that O
length O
of O
time O
. O
As O
a O
carpenter O
's O
nails O
are O
divided O
into O
wrought O
nails O
and O
cut O
nails O
; O
so O
mankind O
may O
be O
similarly O
divided O
. O
Little O
Flask O
was O
one O
of O
the O
wrought O
ones O
; O
made O
to O
clinch O
tight O
and O
last O
long O
. O
They O
called O
him O
King-Post O
on O
board O
of O
the O
Pequod O
; O
because O
, O
in O
form O
, O
he O
could O
be O
well O
likened O
to O
the O
short O
, O
square O
timber O
known O
by O
that O
name O
in O
Arctic O
whalers O
; O
and O
which O
by O
the O
means O
of O
many O
radiating O
side O
timbers O
inserted O
into O
it O
, O
serves O
to O
brace O
the O
ship O
against O
the O
icy O
concussions O
of O
those O
battering O
seas O
. O
Now O
these O
three O
mates—Starbuck O
, O
Stubb O
and O
Flask O
, O
were O
momentous O
men O
. O
They O
it O
was O
who O
by O
universal O
prescription O
commanded O
three O
of O
the O
Pequod O
's O
boats O
as O
headsmen O
. O
In O
that O
grand O
order O
of O
battle O
in O
which O
Captain O
Ahab O
would O
probably O
marshal O
his O
forces O
to O
descend O
on O
the O
whales O
, O
these O
three O
headsmen O
were O
as O
captains O
of O
companies O
. O
Or O
, O
being O
armed O
with O
their O
long O
keen O
whaling O
spears O
, O
they O
were O
as O
a O
picked O
trio O
of O
lancers O
; O
even O
as O
the O
harpooneers O
were O
flingers O
of O
javelins O
. O
And O
since O
in O
this O
famous O
fishery O
, O
each O
mate O
or O
headsman O
, O
like O
a O
Gothic O
Knight O
of O
old O
, O
is O
always O
accompanied O
by O
his O
boat-steerer O
or O
harpooneer O
, O
who O
in O
certain O
conjunctures O
provides O
him O
with O
a O
fresh O
lance O
, O
when O
the O
former O
one O
has O
been O
badly O
twisted O
, O
or O
elbowed O
in O
the O
assault O
; O
and O
moreover O
, O
as O
there O
generally O
subsists O
between O
the O
two O
, O
a O
close O
intimacy O
and O
friendliness O
; O
it O
is O
therefore O
but O
meet O
, O
that O
in O
this O
place O
we O
set O
down O
who O
the O
Pequod O
's O
harpooneers O
were O
, O
and O
to O
what O
headsman O
each O
of O
them O
belonged O
. O
First O
of O
all O
was O
Queequeg O
, O
whom O
Starbuck O
, O
the O
chief O
mate O
, O
had O
selected O
for O
his O
squire O
. O
But O
Queequeg O
is O
already O
known O
. O
Next O
was O
Tashtego O
, O
an O
unmixed O
Indian O
from O
Gay O
Head O
, O
the O
most O
westerly O
promontory O
of O
Martha O
's O
Vineyard O
, O
where O
there O
still O
exists O
the O
last O
remnant O
of O
a O
village O
of O
red O
men O
, O
which O
has O
long O
supplied O
the O
neighboring O
island O
of O
Nantucket O
with O
many O
of O
her O
most O
daring O
harpooneers O
. O
In O
the O
fishery O
, O
they O
usually O
go O
by O
the O
generic O
name O
of O
Gay-Headers O
. O
Tashtego O
's O
long O
, O
lean O
, O
sable O
hair O
, O
his O
high O
cheek O
bones O
, O
and O
black O
rounding O
eyes—for O
an O
Indian O
, O
Oriental O
in O
their O
largeness O
, O
but O
Antarctic O
in O
their O
glittering O
expression—all O
this O
sufficiently O
proclaimed O
him O
an O
inheritor O
of O
the O
unvitiated O
blood O
of O
those O
proud O
warrior O
hunters O
, O
who O
, O
in O
quest O
of O
the O
great O
New O
England O
moose O
, O
had O
scoured O
, O
bow O
in O
hand O
, O
the O
aboriginal O
forests O
of O
the O
main O
. O
But O
no O
longer O
snuffing O
in O
the O
trail O
of O
the O
wild O
beasts O
of O
the O
woodland O
, O
Tashtego O
now O
hunted O
in O
the O
wake O
of O
the O
great O
whales O
of O
the O
sea O
; O
the O
unerring O
harpoon O
of O
the O
son O
fitly O
replacing O
the O
infallible O
arrow O
of O
the O
sires O
. O
To O
look O
at O
the O
tawny O
brawn O
of O
his O
lithe O
snaky O
limbs O
, O
you O
would O
almost O
have O
credited O
the O
superstitions O
of O
some O
of O
the O
earlier O
Puritans O
and O
half O
believed O
this O
wild O
Indian O
to O
be O
a O
son O
of O
the O
Prince O
of O
the O
Powers O
of O
the O
Air O
. O
Tashtego O
was O
Stubb O
the O
second O
mate O
's O
squire O
. O
Third O
among O
the O
harpooneers O
was O
Daggoo O
, O
a O
gigantic O
, O
coal-black O
negro-savage O
, O
with O
a O
lion-like O
tread—an O
Ahasuerus O
to O
behold O
. O
Suspended O
from O
his O
ears O
were O
two O
golden O
hoops O
, O
so O
large O
that O
the O
sailors O
called O
them O
ringbolts O
, O
and O
would O
talk O
of O
securing O
the O
top-sail O
halyards O
to O
them O
. O
In O
his O
youth O
Daggoo O
had O
voluntarily O
shipped O
on O
board O
of O
a O
whaler O
, O
lying O
in O
a O
lonely O
bay O
on O
his O
native O
coast O
. O
And O
never O
having O
been O
anywhere O
in O
the O
world O
but O
in O
Africa O
, O
Nantucket O
, O
and O
the O
pagan O
harbors O
most O
frequented O
by O
the O
whalemen O
; O
and O
having O
now O
led O
for O
many O
years O
the O
bold O
life O
of O
the O
fishery O
in O
the O
ships O
of O
owners O
uncommonly O
heedful O
of O
what O
manner O
of O
men O
they O
shipped O
; O
Daggoo O
retained O
all O
his O
barbaric O
virtues O
, O
and O
erect O
as O
a O
giraffe O
, O
moved O
about O
the O
decks O
in O
all O
the O
pomp O
of O
six O
feet O
five O
in O
his O
socks O
. O
There O
was O
a O
corporeal O
humility O
in O
looking O
up O
at O
him O
; O
and O
a O
white O
man O
standing O
before O
him O
seemed O
a O
white O
flag O
come O
to O
beg O
truce O
of O
a O
fortress O
. O
Curious O
to O
tell O
, O
this O
imperial O
negro O
, O
Ahasuerus O
Daggoo O
, O
was O
the O
Squire O
of O
little O
Flask O
, O
who O
looked O
like O
a O
chess-man O
beside O
him O
. O
As O
for O
the O
residue O
of O
the O
Pequod O
's O
company O
, O
be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
at O
the O
present O
day O
not O
one O
in O
two O
of O
the O
many O
thousand O
men O
before O
the O
mast O
employed O
in O
the O
American O
whale O
fishery O
, O
are O
Americans O
born O
, O
though O
pretty O
nearly O
all O
the O
officers O
are O
. O
Herein O
it O
is O
the O
same O
with O
the O
American O
whale O
fishery O
as O
with O
the O
American O
army O
and O
military O
and O
merchant O
navies O
, O
and O
the O
engineering O
forces O
employed O
in O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
American O
Canals O
and O
Railroads O
. O
The O
same O
, O
I O
say O
, O
because O
in O
all O
these O
cases O
the O
native O
American O
liberally O
provides O
the O
brains O
, O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
world O
as O
generously O
supplying O
the O
muscles O
. O
No O
small O
number O
of O
these O
whaling O
seamen O
belong O
to O
the O
Azores O
, O
where O
the O
outward O
bound O
Nantucket O
whalers O
frequently O
touch O
to O
augment O
their O
crews O
from O
the O
hardy O
peasants O
of O
those O
rocky O
shores O
. O
In O
like O
manner O
, O
the O
Greenland O
whalers O
sailing O
out O
of O
Hull O
or O
London O
, O
put O
in O
at O
the O
Shetland O
Islands O
, O
to O
receive O
the O
full O
complement O
of O
their O
crew O
. O
Upon O
the O
passage O
homewards O
, O
they O
drop O
them O
there O
again O
. O
How O
it O
is O
, O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
, O
but O
Islanders O
seem O
to O
make O
the O
best O
whalemen O
. O
They O
were O
nearly O
all O
Islanders O
in O
the O
Pequod O
, O
Isolatoes O
too O
, O
I O
call O
such O
, O
not O
acknowledging O
the O
common O
continent O
of O
men O
, O
but O
each O
Isolato O
living O
on O
a O
separate O
continent O
of O
his O
own O
. O
Yet O
now O
, O
federated O
along O
one O
keel O
, O
what O
a O
set O
these O
Isolatoes O
were O
! O

and O
all O

Old O
Ahab O
