The O
chief O
mate O
of O
the O
Pequod O
was O
Starbuck O
, O
a O
native O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
and O
a O
Quaker O
by O
descent O
. O
He O
was O
a O
long O
, O
earnest O
man O
, O
and O
though O
born O
on O
an O
icy O
coast O
, O
seemed O
well O
adapted O
to O
endure O
hot O
latitudes O
, O
his O
flesh O
being O
hard O
as O
twice-baked O
biscuit O
. O
Transported O
to O
the O
Indies O
, O
his O
live O
blood O
would O
not O
spoil O
like O
bottled O
ale O
. O
He O
must O
have O
been O
born O
in O
some O
time O
of O
general O
drought O
and O
famine O
, O
or O
upon O
one O
of O
those O
fast O
days O
for O
which O
his O
state O
is O
famous O
. O
Only O
some O
thirty O
arid O
summers O
had O
he O
seen O
; O
those O
summers O
had O
dried O
up O
all O
his O
physical O
superfluousness O
. O
But O
this O
, O
his O
thinness O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
, O
seemed O
no O
more O
the O
token O
of O
wasting O
anxieties O
and O
cares O
, O
than O
it O
seemed O
the O
indication O
of O
any O
bodily O
blight O
. O
It O
was O
merely O
the O
condensation O
of O
the O
man O
. O
He O
was O
by O
no O
means O
ill-looking O
; O
quite O
the O
contrary O
. O
His O
pure O
tight O
skin O
was O
an O
excellent O
fit O
; O
and O
closely O
wrapped O
up O
in O
it O
, O
and O
embalmed O
with O
inner O
health O
and O
strength O
, O
like O
a O
revivified O
Egyptian O
, O
this O
Starbuck O
seemed O
prepared O
to O
endure O
for O
long O
ages O
to O
come O
, O
and O
to O
endure O
always O
, O
as O
now O
; O
for O
be O
it O
Polar O
snow O
or O
torrid O
sun O
, O
like O
a O
patent O
chronometer O
, O
his O
interior O
vitality O
was O
warranted O
to O
do O
well O
in O
all O
climates O
. O
Looking O
into O
his O
eyes O
, O
you O
seemed O
to O
see O
there O
the O
yet O
lingering O
images O
of O
those O
thousand-fold O
perils O
he O
had O
calmly O
confronted O
through O
life O
. O
A O
staid O
, O
steadfast O
man O
, O
whose O
life O
for O
the O
most O
part O
was O
a O
telling O
pantomime O
of O
action O
, O
and O
not O
a O
tame O
chapter O
of O
sounds O
. O
Yet O
, O
for O
all O
his O
hardy O
sobriety O
and O
fortitude O
, O
there O
were O
certain O
qualities O
in O
him O
which O
at O
times O
affected O
, O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
seemed O
well O
nigh O
to O
overbalance O
all O
the O
rest O
. O
Uncommonly O
conscientious O
for O
a O
seaman O
, O
and O
endued O
with O
a O
deep O
natural O
reverence O
, O
the O
wild O
watery O
loneliness O
of O
his O
life O
did O
therefore O
strongly O
incline O
him O
to O
superstition O
; O
but O
to O
that O
sort O
of O
superstition O
, O
which O
in O
some O
organizations O
seems O
rather O
to O
spring O
, O
somehow O
, O
from O
intelligence O
than O
from O
ignorance O
. O
Outward O
portents O
and O
inward O
presentiments O
were O
his O
. O
And O
if O
at O
times O
these O
things O
bent O
the O
welded O
iron O
of O
his O
soul O
, O
much O
more O
did O
his O
far-away O
domestic O
memories O
of O
his O
young O
Cape O
wife O
and O
child O
, O
tend O
to O
bend O
him O
still O
more O
from O
the O
original O
ruggedness O
of O
his O
nature O
, O
and O
open O
him O
still O
further O
to O
those O
latent O
influences O
which O
, O
in O
some O
honest-hearted O
men O
, O
restrain O
the O
gush O
of O
dare-devil O
daring O
, O
so O
often O
evinced O
by O
others O
in O
the O
more O
perilous O
vicissitudes O
of O
the O
fishery O
. O
" O
I O
will O
have O
no O
man O
in O
my O
boat O
, O
" O
said O
Starbuck O
, O
" O
who O
is O
not O
afraid O
of O
a O
whale O
. O
" O
By O
this O
, O
he O
seemed O
to O
mean O
, O
not O
only O
that O
the O
most O
reliable O
and O
useful O
courage O
was O
that O
which O
arises O
from O
the O
fair O
estimation O
of O
the O
encountered O
peril O
, O
but O
that O
an O
utterly O
fearless O
man O
is O
a O
far O
more O
dangerous O
comrade O
than O
a O
coward O
. O
" O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
" O
said O
Stubb O
, O
the O
second O
mate O
, O
" O
Starbuck O
, O
there O
, O
is O
as O
careful O
a O
man O
as O
you O
'll O
find O
anywhere O
in O
this O
fishery O
. O
" O
But O
we O
shall O
ere O
long O
see O
what O
that O
word O
" O
careful O
" O
precisely O
means O
when O
used O
by O
a O
man O
like O
Stubb O
, O
or O
almost O
any O
other O
whale O
hunter O
. O
Starbuck O
was O
no O
crusader O
after O
perils O
; O
in O
him O
courage O
was O
not O
a O
sentiment O
; O
but O
a O
thing O
simply O
useful O
to O
him O
, O
and O
always O
at O
hand O
upon O
all O
mortally O
practical O
occasions O
. O
Besides O
, O
he O
thought O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
in O
this O
business O
of O
whaling O
, O
courage O
was O
one O
of O
the O
great O
staple O
outfits O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
like O
her O
beef O
and O
her O
bread O
, O
and O
not O
to O
be O
foolishly O
wasted O
. O
Wherefore O
he O
had O
no O
fancy O
for O
lowering O
for O
whales O
after O
sun-down O
; O
nor O
for O
persisting O
in O
fighting O
a O
fish O
that O
too O
much O
persisted O
in O
fighting O
him O
. O
For O
, O
thought O
Starbuck O
, O
I O
am O
here O
in O
this O
critical O
ocean O
to O
kill O
whales O
for O
my O
living O
, O
and O
not O
to O
be O
killed O
by O
them O
for O
theirs O
; O
and O
that O
hundreds O
of O
men O
had O
been O
so O
killed O
Starbuck O
well O
knew O
. O
What O
doom O
was O
his O
own O
father O
's O
? O
Where O
, O
in O
the O
bottomless O
deeps O
, O
could O
he O
find O
the O
torn O
limbs O
of O
his O
brother O
? O
With O
memories O
like O
these O
in O
him O
, O
and O
, O
moreover O
, O
given O
to O
a O
certain O
superstitiousness O
, O
as O
has O
been O
said O
; O
the O
courage O
of O
this O
Starbuck O
, O
which O
could O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
still O
flourish O
, O
must O
indeed O
have O
been O
extreme O
. O
But O
it O
was O
not O
in O
reasonable O
nature O
that O
a O
man O
so O
organized O
, O
and O
with O
such O
terrible O
experiences O
and O
remembrances O
as O
he O
had O
; O
it O
was O
not O
in O
nature O
that O
these O
things O
should O
fail O
in O
latently O
engendering O
an O
element O
in O
him O
, O
which O
, O
under O
suitable O
circumstances O
, O
would O
break O
out O
from O
its O
confinement O
, O
and O
burn O
all O
his O
courage O
up O
. O
And O
brave O
as O
he O
might O
be O
, O
it O
was O
that O
sort O
of O
bravery O
chiefly O
, O
visible O
in O
some O
intrepid O
men O
, O
which O
, O
while O
generally O
abiding O
firm O
in O
the O
conflict O
with O
seas O
, O
or O
winds O
, O
or O
whales O
, O
or O
any O
of O
the O
ordinary O
irrational O
horrors O
of O
the O
world O
, O
yet O
can O
not O
withstand O
those O
more O
terrific O
, O
because O
more O
spiritual O
terrors O
, O
which O
sometimes O
menace O
you O
from O
the O
concentrating O
brow O
of O
an O
enraged O
and O
mighty O
man O
. O
But O
were O
the O
coming O
narrative O
to O
reveal O
in O
any O
instance O
, O
the O
complete O
abasement O
of O
poor O
Starbuck O
's O
fortitude O
, O
scarce O
might O
I O
have O
the O
heart O
to O
write O
it O
; O
for O
it O
is O
a O
thing O
most O
sorrowful O
, O
nay O
shocking O
, O
to O
expose O
the O
fall O
of O
valor O
in O
the O
soul O
. O
Men O
may O
seem O
detestable O
as O
joint O
stock-companies O
and O
nations O
; O
knaves O
, O
fools O
, O
and O
murderers O
there O
may O
be O
; O
men O
may O
have O
mean O
and O
meagre O
faces O
; O
but O
, O
man O
, O
in O
the O
ideal O
, O
is O
so O
noble O
and O
so O
sparkling O
, O
such O
a O
grand O
and O
glowing O
creature O
, O
that O
over O
any O
ignominious O
blemish O
in O
him O
all O
his O
fellows O
should O
run O
to O
throw O
their O
costliest O
robes O
. O
That O
immaculate O
manliness O
we O
feel O
within O
ourselves O
, O
so O
far O
within O
us O
, O
that O
it O
remains O
intact O
though O
all O
the O
outer O
character O
seem O
gone O
; O
bleeds O
with O
keenest O
anguish O
at O
the O
undraped O
spectacle O
of O
a O
valor-ruined O
man O
. O
Nor O
can O
piety O
itself O
, O
at O
such O
a O
shameful O
sight O
, O
completely O
stifle O
her O
upbraidings O
against O
the O
permitting O
stars O
. O
But O
this O
august O
dignity O
I O
treat O
of O
, O
is O
not O
the O
dignity O
of O
kings O
and O
robes O
, O
but O
that O
abounding O
dignity O
which O
has O
no O
robed O
investiture O
. O
Thou O
shalt O
see O
it O
shining O
in O
the O
arm O
that O
wields O
a O
pick O
or O
drives O
a O
spike O
; O
that O
democratic O
dignity O
which O
, O
on O
all O
hands O
, O
radiates O
without O
end O
from O
God O
; O
Himself O
! O
The O
great O
God O
absolute O
! O
The O
centre O
and O
circumference O
of O
all O
democracy O
! O
His O
omnipresence O
, O
our O
divine O
equality O
! O
If O
, O
then O
, O
to O
meanest O
mariners O
, O
and O
renegades O
and O
castaways O
, O
I O
shall O
hereafter O
ascribe O
high O
qualities O
, O
though O
dark O
; O
weave O
round O
them O
tragic O
graces O
; O
if O
even O
the O
most O
mournful O
, O
perchance O
the O
most O
abased O
, O
among O
them O
all O
, O
shall O
at O
times O
lift O
himself O
to O
the O
exalted O
mounts O
; O
if O
I O
shall O
touch O
that O
workman O
's O
arm O
with O
some O
ethereal O
light O
; O
if O
I O
shall O
spread O
a O
rainbow O
over O
his O
disastrous O
set O
of O
sun O
; O
then O
against O
all O
mortal O
critics O
bear O
me O
out O
in O
it O
, O
thou O
just O
Spirit O
of O
Equality O
, O
which O
hast O
spread O
one O
royal O
mantle O
of O
humanity O
over O
all O
my O
kind O
! O
Bear O
me O
out O
in O
it O
, O
thou O
great O
democratic O
God O
! O
who O
didst O
not O
refuse O
to O
the O
swart O
convict O
, O
Bunyan O
, O
the O
pale O
, O
poetic O
pearl O
; O
Thou O
who O
didst O
clothe O
with O
doubly O
hammered O
leaves O
of O
finest O
gold O
, O
the O
stumped O
and O
paupered O
arm O
of O
old O
Cervantes O
; O
Thou O
who O
didst O
pick O
up O
Andrew O
Jackson O
from O
the O
pebbles O
; O
who O
didst O
hurl O
him O
upon O
a O
war-horse O
; O
who O
didst O
thunder O
him O
higher O
than O
a O
throne O
! O
Thou O
who O
, O
in O
all O
Thy O
mighty O
, O
earthly O
marchings O
, O
ever O
cullest O
Thy O
selectest O
champions O
from O
the O
kingly O
commoners O
; O
bear O
me O
out O
in O
it O
, O
O O
God O
! O
