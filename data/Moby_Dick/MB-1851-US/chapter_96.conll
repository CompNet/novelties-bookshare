Besides O
her O
hoisted O
boats O
, O
an O
American O
whaler O
is O
outwardly O
distinguished O
by O
her O
try-works O
. O
She O
presents O
the O
curious O
anomaly O
of O
the O
most O
solid O
masonry O
joining O
with O
oak O
and O
hemp O
in O
constituting O
the O
completed O
ship O
. O
It O
is O
as O
if O
from O
the O
open O
field O
a O
brick-kiln O
were O
transported O
to O
her O
planks O
. O
The O
try-works O
are O
planted O
between O
the O
foremast O
and O
main-mast O
, O
the O
most O
roomy O
part O
of O
the O
deck O
. O
The O
timbers O
beneath O
are O
of O
a O
peculiar O
strength O
, O
fitted O
to O
sustain O
the O
weight O
of O
an O
almost O
solid O
mass O
of O
brick O
and O
mortar O
, O
some O
ten O
feet O
by O
eight O
square O
, O
and O
five O
in O
height O
. O
The O
foundation O
does O
not O
penetrate O
the O
deck O
, O
but O
the O
masonry O
is O
firmly O
secured O
to O
the O
surface O
by O
ponderous O
knees O
of O
iron O
bracing O
it O
on O
all O
sides O
, O
and O
screwing O
it O
down O
to O
the O
timbers O
. O
On O
the O
flanks O
it O
is O
cased O
with O
wood O
, O
and O
at O
top O
completely O
covered O
by O
a O
large O
, O
sloping O
, O
battened O
hatch-way O
. O
Removing O
this O
hatch O
we O
expose O
the O
great O
try-pots O
, O
two O
in O
number O
, O
and O
each O
of O
several O
barrels O
' O
capacity O
. O
When O
not O
in O
use O
, O
they O
are O
kept O
remarkably O
clean O
. O
Sometimes O
they O
are O
polished O
with O
soapstone O
and O
sand O
, O
till O
they O
shine O
within O
like O
silver O
punch-bowls O
. O
During O
the O
night-watches O
some O
cynical O
old O
sailors O
will O
crawl O
into O
them O
and O
coil O
themselves O
away O
there O
for O
a O
nap O
. O
While O
employed O
in O
polishing O
them—one O
man O
in O
each O
pot O
, O
side O
by O
side—many O
confidential O
communications O
are O
carried O
on O
, O
over O
the O
iron O
lips O
. O
It O
is O
a O
place O
also O
for O
profound O
mathematical O
meditation O
. O
It O
was O
in O
the O
left O
hand O
try-pot O
of O
the O
Pequod O
, O
with O
the O
soapstone O
diligently O
circling O
round O
me O
, O
that O
I O
was O
first O
indirectly O
struck O
by O
the O
remarkable O
fact O
, O
that O
in O
geometry O
all O
bodies O
gliding O
along O
the O
cycloid O
, O
my O
soapstone O
for O
example O
, O
will O
descend O
from O
any O
point O
in O
precisely O
the O
same O
time O
. O
Removing O
the O
fire-board O
from O
the O
front O
of O
the O
try-works O
, O
the O
bare O
masonry O
of O
that O
side O
is O
exposed O
, O
penetrated O
by O
the O
two O
iron O
mouths O
of O
the O
furnaces O
, O
directly O
underneath O
the O
pots O
. O
These O
mouths O
are O
fitted O
with O
heavy O
doors O
of O
iron O
. O
The O
intense O
heat O
of O
the O
fire O
is O
prevented O
from O
communicating O
itself O
to O
the O
deck O
, O
by O
means O
of O
a O
shallow O
reservoir O
extending O
under O
the O
entire O
inclosed O
surface O
of O
the O
works O
. O
By O
a O
tunnel O
inserted O
at O
the O
rear O
, O
this O
reservoir O
is O
kept O
replenished O
with O
water O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
evaporates O
. O
There O
are O
no O
external O
chimneys O
; O
they O
open O
direct O
from O
the O
rear O
wall O
. O
And O
here O
let O
us O
go O
back O
for O
a O
moment O
. O
It O
was O
about O
nine O
o'clock O
at O
night O
that O
the O
Pequod O
's O
try-works O
were O
first O
started O
on O
this O
present O
voyage O
. O
It O
belonged O
to O
Stubb O
to O
oversee O
the O
business O
. O
" O
All O
ready O
there O
? O
Off O
hatch O
, O
then O
, O
and O
start O
her O
. O
You O
cook O
, O
fire O
the O
works O
. O
" O
This O
was O
an O
easy O
thing O
, O
for O
the O
carpenter O
had O
been O
thrusting O
his O
shavings O
into O
the O
furnace O
throughout O
the O
passage O
. O
Here O
be O
it O
said O
that O
in O
a O
whaling O
voyage O
the O
first O
fire O
in O
the O
try-works O
has O
to O
be O
fed O
for O
a O
time O
with O
wood O
. O
After O
that O
no O
wood O
is O
used O
, O
except O
as O
a O
means O
of O
quick O
ignition O
to O
the O
staple O
fuel O
. O
In O
a O
word O
, O
after O
being O
tried O
out O
, O
the O
crisp O
, O
shrivelled O
blubber O
, O
now O
called O
scraps O
or O
fritters O
, O
still O
contains O
considerable O
of O
its O
unctuous O
properties O
. O
These O
fritters O
feed O
the O
flames O
. O
Like O
a O
plethoric O
burning O
martyr O
, O
or O
a O
self-consuming O
misanthrope O
, O
once O
ignited O
, O
the O
whale O
supplies O
his O
own O
fuel O
and O
burns O
by O
his O
own O
body O
. O
Would O
that O
he O
consumed O
his O
own O
smoke O
! O
for O
his O
smoke O
is O
horrible O
to O
inhale O
, O
and O
inhale O
it O
you O
must O
, O
and O
not O
only O
that O
, O
but O
you O
must O
live O
in O
it O
for O
the O
time O
. O
It O
has O
an O
unspeakable O
, O
wild O
, O
Hindoo O
odor O
about O
it O
, O
such O
as O
may O
lurk O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
funereal O
pyres O
. O
It O
smells O
like O
the O
left O
wing O
of O
the O
day O
of O
judgment O
; O
it O
is O
an O
argument O
for O
the O
pit O
. O
By O
midnight O
the O
works O
were O
in O
full O
operation O
. O
We O
were O
: O
clear O
from O
the O
carcase O
; O
sail O
had O
been O
made O
; O
the O
wind O
was O
freshening O
; O
the O
wild O
ocean O
darkness O
was O
intense O
. O
But O
that O
darkness O
was O
licked O
up O
by O
the O
fierce O
flames O
, O
which O
at O
intervals O
forked O
forth O
from O
the O
sooty O
flues O
, O
and O
illuminated O
every O
lofty O
rope O
in O
the O
rigging O
, O
as O
with O
the O
famed O
Greek O
fire O
. O
The O
burning O
ship O
drove O
on O
, O
as O
if O
remorselessly O
commissioned O
to O
some O
vengeful O
deed O
. O
So O
the O
pitch O
and O
sulphur-freighted O
brigs O
of O
the O
bold O
Hydriote O
, O
Canaris O
, O
issuing O
from O
their O
midnight O
harbors O
, O
with O
broad O
sheets O
of O
flame O
for O
sails O
, O
bore O
down O
upon O
the O
Turkish O
frigates O
, O
and O
folded O
them O
in O
conflagrations O
. O
The O
hatch O
, O
removed O
from O
the O
top O
of O
the O
works O
, O
now O
afforded O
a O
wide O
hearth O
in O
front O
of O
them O
. O
Standing O
on O
this O
were O
the O
Tartarean O
shapes O
of O
the O
pagan O
harpooneers O
, O
always O
the O
whaleship O
's O
stokers O
. O
With O
huge O
pronged O
poles O
they O
pitched O
hissing O
masses O
of O
blubber O
into O
the O
scalding O
pots O
, O
or O
stirred O
up O
the O
fires O
beneath O
, O
till O
the O
snaky O
flames O
darted O
, O
curling O
, O
out O
of O
the O
doors O
to O
catch O
them O
by O
the O
feet O
. O
The O
smoke O
rolled O
away O
in O
sullen O
heaps O
. O
To O
every O
pitch O
of O
the O
ship O
there O
was O
a O
pitch O
of O
the O
boiling O
oil O
, O
which O
seemed O
all O
eagerness O
to O
leap O
into O
their O
faces O
. O
Opposite O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
works O
, O
on O
the O
further O
side O
of O
the O
wide O
wooden O
hearth O
, O
was O
the O
windlass O
. O
This O
served O
for O
a O
sea-sofa O
. O
Here O
lounged O
the O
watch O
, O
when O
not O
otherwise O
employed O
, O
looking O
into O
the O
red O
heat O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
till O
their O
eyes O
felt O
scorched O
in O
their O
heads O
. O
Their O
tawny O
features O
, O
now O
all O
begrimed O
with O
smoke O
and O
sweat O
, O
their O
matted O
beards O
, O
and O
the O
contrasting O
barbaric O
brilliancy O
of O
their O
teeth O
, O
all O
these O
were O
strangely O
revealed O
in O
the O
capricious O
emblazonings O
of O
the O
works O
. O
As O
they O
narrated O
to O
each O
other O
their O
unholy O
adventures O
, O
their O
tales O
of O
terror O
told O
in O
words O
of O
mirth O
; O
as O
their O
uncivilized O
laughter O
forked O
upwards O
out O
of O
them O
, O
like O
the O
flames O
from O
the O
furnace O
; O
as O
to O
and O
fro O
, O
in O
their O
front O
, O
the O
harpooneers O
wildly O
gesticulated O
with O
their O
huge O
pronged O
forks O
and O
dippers O
; O
as O
the O
wind O
howled O
on O
, O
and O
the O
sea O
leaped O
, O
and O
the O
ship O
groaned O
and O
dived O
, O
and O
yet O
steadfastly O
shot O
her O
red O
hell O
further O
and O
further O
into O
the O
blackness O
of O
the O
sea O
and O
the O
night O
, O
and O
scornfully O
champed O
the O
white O
bone O
in O
her O
mouth O
, O
and O
viciously O
spat O
round O
her O
on O
all O
sides O
; O
then O
the O
rushing O
Pequod O
, O
freighted O
with O
savages O
, O
and O
laden O
with O
fire O
, O
and O
burning O
a O
corpse O
, O
and O
plunging O
into O
that O
blackness O
of O
darkness O
, O
seemed O
the O
material O
counterpart O
of O
her O
monomaniac O
commander O
's O
soul O
. O
So O
seemed O
it O
to O
me O
, O
as O
I O
stood O
at O
her O
helm O
, O
and O
for O
long O
hours O
silently O
guided O
the O
way O
of O
this O
fire-ship O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
Wrapped O
, O
for O
that O
interval O
, O
in O
darkness O
myself O
, O
I O
but O
the O
better O
saw O
the O
redness O
, O
the O
madness O
, O
the O
ghastliness O
of O
others O
. O
The O
continual O
sight O
of O
the O
fiend O
shapes O
before O
me O
, O
capering O
half O
in O
smoke O
and O
half O
in O
fire O
, O
these O
at O
last O
begat O
kindred O
visions O
in O
my O
soul O
, O
so O
soon O
as O
I O
began O
to O
yield O
to O
that O
unaccountable O
drowsiness O
which O
ever O
would O
come O
over O
me O
at O
a O
midnight O
helm O
. O
But O
that O
night O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
a O
strange O
( O
and O
ever O
since O
inexplicable O
) O
thing O
occurred O
to O
me O
. O
Starting O
from O
a O
brief O
standing O
sleep O
, O
I O
was O
horribly O
conscious O
of O
something O
fatally O
wrong O
. O
The O
jaw-bone O
tiller O
smote O
my O
side O
, O
which O
leaned O
against O
it O
; O
in O
my O
ears O
was O
the O
low O
hum O
of O
sails O
, O
just O
beginning O
to O
shake O
in O
the O
wind O
; O
I O
thought O
my O
eyes O
were O
open O
; O
I O
was O
half O
conscious O
of O
putting O
my O
fingers O
to O
the O
lids O
and O
mechanically O
stretching O
them O
still O
further O
apart O
. O
But O
, O
spite O
of O
all O
this O
, O
I O
could O
see O
no O
compass O
before O
me O
to O
steer O
by O
; O
though O
it O
seemed O
but O
a O
minute O
since O
I O
had O
been O
watching O
the O
card O
, O
by O
the O
steady O
binnacle O
lamp O
illuminating O
it O
. O
Nothing O
seemed O
before O
me O
but O
a O
jet O
gloom O
, O
now O
and O
then O
made O
ghastly O
by O
flashes O
of O
redness O
. O
Uppermost O
was O
the O
impression O
, O
that O
whatever O
swift O
, O
rushing O
thing O
I O
stood O
on O
was O
not O
so O
much O
bound O
to O
any O
haven O
ahead O
as O
rushing O
from O
all O
havens O
astern O
. O
A O
stark O
, O
bewildered O
feeling O
, O
as O
of O
death O
, O
came O
over O
me O
. O
Convulsively O
my O
hands O
grasped O
the O
tiller O
, O
but O
with O
the O
crazy O
conceit O
that O
the O
tiller O
was O
, O
somehow O
, O
in O
some O
enchanted O
way O
, O
inverted O
. O
My O
God O
! O
what O
is O
the O
matter O
with O
me O
? O
thought O
I O
Lo O
! O
in O
my O
brief O
sleep O
I O
had O
turned O
myself O
about O
, O
and O
was O
fronting O
the O
ship O
's O
stern O
, O
with O
my O
back O
to O
her O
prow O
and O
the O
compass O
. O
In O
an O
instant O
I O
faced O
back O
, O
just O
in O
time O
to O
prevent O
the O
vessel O
from O
flying O
up O
into O
the O
wind O
, O
and O
very O
probably O
capsizing O
her O
. O
How O
glad O
and O
how O
grateful O
the O
relief O
from O
this O
unnatural O
hallucination O
of O
the O
night O
, O
and O
the O
fatal O
contingency O
of O
being O
brought O
by O
the O
lee O
! O
Look O
not O
too O
long O
in O
the O
face O
of O
the O
fire O
, O
O O
man O
! O
Never O
dream O
with O
thy O
hand O
on O
the O
helm O
! O
Turn O
not O
thy O
back O
to O
the O
compass O
; O
accept O
the O
first O
hint O
of O
the O
hitching O
tiller O
; O
believe O
not O
the O
artificial O
fire O
, O
when O
its O
redness O
makes O
all O
things O
look O
ghastly O
. O
To-morrow O
, O
in O
the O
natural O
sun O
, O
the O
skies O
will O
be O
bright O
; O
those O
who O
glared O
like O
devils O
in O
the O
forking O
flames O
, O
the O
morn O
will O
show O
in O
far O
other O
, O
at O
least O
gentler O
, O
relief O
; O
the O
glorious O
, O
golden O
, O
glad O
sun O
, O
the O
only O
true O
lamp—all O
others O
but O
liars O
! O
Nevertheless O
the O
sun O
hides O
not O
Virginia O
's O
Dismal O
Swamp O
, O
nor O
Rome O
's O
accursed O
Campagna O
, O
nor O
wide O
Sahara O
, O
nor O
all O
the O
millions O
of O
miles O
of O
deserts O
and O
of O
griefs O
beneath O
the O
moon O
. O
The O
sun O
hides O
not O
the O
ocean O
, O
which O
is O
the O
dark O
side O
of O
this O
earth O
, O
and O
which O
is O
two O
thirds O
of O
this O
earth O
. O
So O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
mortal O
man O
who O
hath O
more O
of O
joy O
than O
sorrow O
in O
him O
, O
that O
mortal O
man O
can O
not O
be O
true—not O
true O
, O
or O
undeveloped O
. O
'With O

truest O
of O

the O

for O

there O

a O
woe O

And O
there O
is O
a O
Catskill O
eagle O
in O
some O
souls O

can O
alike O
dive O
down O
into O
the O
blackest O
gorges O
, O
and O
soar O
out O
of O
them O
again O

become O
invisible O
in O
the O
sunny O
spaces O

And O
even O
if O

the O

that O
gorge O
is O
in O
the O
mountains O

so O
that O

in O

the O

eagle O

still O
higher O
