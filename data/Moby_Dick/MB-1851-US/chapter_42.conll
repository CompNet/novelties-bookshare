What O
the O
white O
whale O
was O
to O
Ahab O
, O
has O
been O
hinted O
; O
what O
, O
at O
times O
, O
he O
was O
to O
me O
, O
as O
yet O
remains O
unsaid O
. O
Aside O
from O
those O
more O
obvious O
considerations O
touching O
Moby O
Dick O
, O
which O
could O
not O
but O
occasionally O
awaken O
in O
any O
man O
's O
soul O
some O
alarm O
, O
there O
was O
another O
thought O
, O
or O
rather O
vague O
, O
nameless O
horror O
concerning O
him O
, O
which O
at O
times O
by O
its O
intensity O
completely O
overpowered O
all O
the O
rest O
; O
and O
yet O
so O
mystical O
and O
well O
nigh O
ineffable O
was O
it O
, O
that O
I O
almost O
despair O
of O
putting O
it O
in O
a O
comprehensible O
form O
. O
It O
was O
the O
whiteness O
of O
the O
whale O
that O
above O
all O
things O
appalled O
me O
. O
But O
how O
can O
I O
hope O
to O
explain O
myself O
here O
; O
and O
yet O
, O
in O
some O
dim O
, O
random O
way O
, O
explain O
myself O
I O
must O
, O
else O
all O
these O
chapters O
might O
be O
naught O
. O
Though O
in O
many O
natural O
objects O
, O
whiteness O
refiningly O
enhances O
beauty O
, O
as O
if O
imparting O
some O
special O
virtue O
of O
its O
own O
, O
as O
in O
marbles O
, O
japonicas O
, O
and O
pearls O
; O
and O
though O
various O
nations O
have O
in O
some O
way O
recognised O
a O
certain O
royal O
preeminence O
in O
this O
hue O
; O
even O
the O
barbaric O
, O
grand O
old O
kings O
of O
Pegu O
placing O
the O
title O
" O
Lord O
of O
the O
White O
Elephants O
" O
above O
all O
their O
other O
magniloquent O
ascriptions O
of O
dominion O
; O
and O
the O
modern O
kings O
of O
Siam O
unfurling O
the O
same O
snow-white O
quadruped O
in O
the O
royal O
standard O
; O
and O
the O
Hanoverian O
flag O
bearing O
the O
one O
figure O
of O
a O
snow-white O
charger O
; O
and O
the O
great O
Austrian O
Empire O
, O
Caesarian O
, O
heir O
to O
overlording O
Rome O
, O
having O
for O
the O
imperial O
color O
the O
same O
imperial O
hue O
; O
and O
though O
this O
pre-eminence O
in O
it O
applies O
to O
the O
human O
race O
itself O
, O
giving O
the O
white O
man O
ideal O
mastership O
over O
every O
dusky O
tribe O
; O
and O
though O
, O
besides O
, O
all O
this O
, O
whiteness O
has O
been O
even O
made O
significant O
of O
gladness O
, O
for O
among O
the O
Romans O
a O
white O
stone O
marked O
a O
joyful O
day O
; O
and O
though O
in O
other O
mortal O
sympathies O
and O
symbolizings O
, O
this O
same O
hue O
is O
made O
the O
emblem O
of O
many O
touching O
, O
noble O
things—the O
innocence O
of O
brides O
, O
the O
benignity O
of O
age O
; O
though O
among O
the O
Red O
Men O
of O
America O
the O
giving O
of O
the O
white O
belt O
of O
wampum O
was O
the O
deepest O
pledge O
of O
honor O
; O
though O
in O
many O
climes O
, O
whiteness O
typifies O
the O
majesty O
of O
Justice O
in O
the O
ermine O
of O
the O
Judge O
, O
and O
contributes O
to O
the O
daily O
state O
of O
kings O
and O
queens O
drawn O
by O
milk-white O
steeds O
; O
though O
even O
in O
the O
higher O
mysteries O
of O
the O
most O
august O
religions O
it O
has O
been O
made O
the O
symbol O
of O
the O
divine O
spotlessness O
and O
power O
; O
by O
the O
Persian O
fire O
worshippers O
, O
the O
white O
forked O
flame O
being O
held O
the O
holiest O
on O
the O
altar O
; O
and O
in O
the O
Greek O
mythologies O
, O
Great O
Jove O
himself O
being O
made O
incarnate O
in O
a O
snow-white O
bull O
; O
and O
though O
to O
the O
noble O
Iroquois O
, O
the O
midwinter O
sacrifice O
of O
the O
sacred O
White O
Dog O
was O
by O
far O
the O
holiest O
festival O
of O
their O
theology O
, O
that O
spotless O
, O
faithful O
creature O
being O
held O
the O
purest O
envoy O
they O
could O
send O
to O
the O
Great O
Spirit O
with O
the O
annual O
tidings O
of O
their O
own O
fidelity O
; O
and O
though O
directly O
from O
the O
Latin O
word O
for O
white O
, O
all O
Christian O
priests O
derive O
the O
name O
of O
one O
part O
of O
their O
sacred O
vesture O
, O
the O
alb O
or O
tunic O
, O
worn O
beneath O
the O
cassock O
; O
and O
though O
among O
the O
holy O
pomps O
of O
the O
Romish O
faith O
, O
white O
is O
specially O
employed O
in O
the O
celebration O
of O
the O
Passion O
of O
our O
Lord O
; O
though O
in O
the O
Vision O
of O
St. O
John O
, O
white O
robes O
are O
given O
to O
the O
redeemed O
, O
and O
the O
four-and-twenty O
elders O
stand O
clothed O
in O
white O
before O
the O
great-white O
throne O
, O
and O
the O
Holy O
One O
that O
sitteth O
there O
white O
like O
wool O
; O
yet O
for O
all O
these O
accumulated O
associations O
, O
with O
whatever O
is O
sweet O
, O
and O
honorable O
, O
and O
sublime O
, O
there O
yet O
lurks O
an O
elusive O
something O
in O
the O
innermost O
idea O
of O
this O
hue O
, O
which O
strikes O
more O
of O
panic O
to O
the O
soul O
than O
that O
redness O
which O
affrights O
in O
blood O
. O
This O
elusive O
quality O
it O
is O
, O
which O
causes O
the O
thought O
of O
whiteness O
, O
when O
divorced O
from O
more O
kindly O
associations O
, O
and O
coupled O
with O
any O
object O
terrible O
in O
itself O
, O
to O
heighten O
that O
terror O
to O
the O
furthest O
bounds O
. O
Witness O
the O
white O
bear O
of O
the O
poles O
, O
and O
the O
white O
shark O
of O
the O
tropics O
; O
what O
but O
their O
smooth O
, O
flaky O
whiteness O
makes O
them O
the O
transcendent O
horrors O
they O
are O
? O
That O
ghastly O
whiteness O
it O
is O
which O
imparts O
such O
an O
abhorrent O
mildness O
, O
even O
more O
loathsome O
than O
terrific O
, O
to O
the O
dumb O
gloating O
of O
their O
aspect O
. O
So O
that O
not O
the O
fierce-fanged O
tiger O
in O
his O
heraldic O
coat O
can O
so O
stagger O
courage O
as O
the O
white-shrouded O
bear O
or O
shark O
. O
[ O

] O
Bethink O
thee O
of O
the O
albatross O
, O
whence O
come O
those O
clouds O
of O
spiritual O
wonderment O
and O
pale O
dread O
, O
in O
which O
that O
white O
phantom O
sails O
in O
all O
imaginations O
? O
Not O
Coleridge O
first O
threw O
that O
spell O
; O
but O
God O
's O
great O
, O
unflattering O
laureate O
, O
Nature O
. O
[ O
2 O
] O
Most O
famous O
in O
our O
Western O
annals O
and O
Indian O
traditions O
is O
that O
of O
the O
White O
Steed O
of O
the O
Prairies O
; O
a O
magnificent O
milk-white O
charger O
, O
large-eyed O
, O
small-headed O
, O
bluff-chested O
, O
and O
with O
the O
dignity O
of O
a O
thousand O
monarchs O
in O
his O
lofty O
, O
overscorning O
carriage O
. O
He O
was O
the O
elected O
Xerxes O
of O
vast O
herds O
of O
wild O
horses O
, O
whose O
pastures O
in O
those O
days O
were O
only O
fenced O
by O
the O
Rocky O
Mountains O
and O
the O
Alleghanies O
. O
At O
their O
flaming O
head O
he O
westward O
trooped O
it O
like O
that O
chosen O
star O
which O
every O
evening O
leads O
on O
the O
hosts O
of O
light O
. O
The O
flashing O
cascade O
of O
his O
mane O
, O
the O
curving O
comet O
of O
his O
tail O
, O
invested O
him O
with O
housings O
more O
resplendent O
than O
gold O
and O
silver-beaters O
could O
have O
furnished O
him O
. O
A O
most O
imperial O
and O
archangelical O
apparition O
of O
that O
unfallen O
, O
western O
world O
, O
which O
to O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
old O
trappers O
and O
hunters O
revived O
the O
glories O
of O
those O
primeval O
times O
when O
Adam O
walked O
majestic O
as O
a O
god O
, O
bluff-bowed O
and O
fearless O
as O
this O
mighty O
steed O
. O
Whether O
marching O
amid O
his O
aides O
and O
marshals O
in O
the O
van O
of O
countless O
cohorts O
that O
endlessly O
streamed O
it O
over O
the O
plains O
, O
like O
an O
Ohio O
; O
or O
whether O
with O
his O
circumambient O
subjects O
browsing O
all O
around O
at O
the O
horizon O
, O
the O
White O
Steed O
gallopingly O
reviewed O
them O
with O
warm O
nostrils O
reddening O
through O
his O
cool O
milkiness O
; O
in O
whatever O
aspect O
he O
presented O
himself O
, O
always O
to O
the O
bravest O
Indians O
he O
was O
the O
object O
of O
trembling O
reverence O
and O
awe O
. O
Nor O
can O
it O
be O
questioned O
from O
what O
stands O
on O
legendary O
record O
of O
this O
noble O
horse O
, O
that O
it O
was O
his O
spiritual O
whiteness O
chiefly O
, O
which O
so O
clothed O
him O
with O
divineness O
; O
and O
that O
this O
divineness O
had O
that O
in O
it O
which O
, O
though O
commanding O
worship O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
enforced O
a O
certain O
nameless O
terror O
. O
But O
there O
are O
other O
instances O
where O
this O
whiteness O
loses O
all O
that O
accessory O
and O
strange O
glory O
which O
invests O
it O
in O
the O
White O
Steed O
and O
Albatross O
. O
What O
is O
it O
that O
in O
the O
Albino O
man O
so O
peculiarly O
repels O
and O
often O
shocks O
the O
eye O
, O
as O
that O
sometimes O
he O
is O
loathed O
by O
his O
own O
kith O
and O
kin O
! O
It O
is O
that O
whiteness O
which O
invests O
him O
, O
a O
thing O
expressed O
by O
the O
name O
he O
bears O
. O
The O
Albino O
is O
as O
well O
made O
as O
other O
men—has O
no O
substantive O
deformity—and O
yet O
this O
mere O
aspect O
of O
all-pervading O
whiteness O
makes O
him O
more O
strangely O
hideous O
than O
the O
ugliest O
abortion O
. O
Why O
should O
this O
be O
so O
? O
Nor O
, O
in O
quite O
other O
aspects O
, O
does O
Nature O
in O
her O
least O
palpable O
but O
not O
the O
less O
malicious O
agencies O
, O
fail O
to O
enlist O
among O
her O
forces O
this O
crowning O
attribute O
of O
the O
terrible O
. O
From O
its O
snowy O
aspect O
, O
the O
gauntleted O
ghost O
of O
the O
Southern O
Seas O
has O
been O
denominated O
the O
White O
Squall O
. O
Nor O
, O
in O
some O
historic O
instances O
, O
has O
the O
art O
of O
human O
malice O
omitted O
so O
potent O
an O
auxiliary O
. O
How O
wildly O
it O
heightens O
the O
effect O
of O
that O
passage O
in O
Froissart O
, O
when O
, O
masked O
in O
the O
snowy O
symbol O
of O
their O
faction O
, O
the O
desperate O
White O
Hoods O
of O
Ghent O
murder O
their O
bailiff O
in O
the O
market-place O
! O
Nor O
, O
in O
some O
things O
, O
does O
the O
common O
, O
hereditary O
experience O
of O
all O
mankind O
fail O
to O
bear O
witness O
to O
the O
supernaturalism O
of O
this O
hue O
. O
It O
can O
not O
well O
be O
doubted O
, O
that O
the O
one O
visible O
quality O
in O
the O
aspect O
of O
the O
dead O
which O
most O
appals O
the O
gazer O
, O
is O
the O
marble O
pallor O
lingering O
there O
; O
as O
if O
indeed O
that O
pallor O
were O
as O
much O
like O
the O
badge O
of O
consternation O
in O
the O
other O
world O
, O
as O
of O
mortal O
trepidation O
here O
. O
And O
from O
that O
pallor O
of O
the O
dead O
, O
we O
borrow O
the O
expressive O
hue O
of O
the O
shroud O
in O
which O
we O
wrap O
them O
. O
Nor O
even O
in O
our O
superstitions O
do O
we O
fail O
to O
throw O
the O
same O
snowy O
mantle O
round O
our O
phantoms O
; O
all O
ghosts O
rising O
in O
a O
milk-white O
fog—Yea O
, O
while O
these O
terrors O
seize O
us O
, O
let O
us O
add O
, O
that O
even O
the O
king O
of O
terrors O
, O
when O
personified O
by O
the O
evangelist O
, O
rides O
on O
his O
pallid O
horse O
. O
Therefore O
, O
in O
his O
other O
moods O
, O
symbolize O
whatever O
grand O
or O
gracious O
thing O
he O
will O
by O
whiteness O
, O
no O
man O
can O
deny O
that O
in O
its O
profoundest O
idealized O
significance O
it O
calls O
up O
a O
peculiar O
apparition O
to O
the O
soul O
. O
But O
though O
without O
dissent O
this O
point O
be O
fixed O
, O
how O
is O
mortal O
man O
to O
account O
for O
it O
? O
To O
analyse O
it O
, O
would O
seem O
impossible O
. O
Can O
we O
, O
then O
, O
by O
the O
citation O
of O
some O
of O
those O
instances O
wherein O
this O
thing O
of O
whiteness—though O
for O
the O
time O
either O
wholly O
or O
in O
great O
part O
stripped O
of O
all O
direct O
associations O
calculated O
to O
impart O
to O
it O
aught O
fearful O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
, O
is O
found O
to O
exert O
over O
us O
the O
same O
sorcery O
, O
however O
modified O
; O
—can O
we O
thus O
hope O
to O
light O
upon O
some O
chance O
clue O
to O
conduct O
us O
to O
the O
hidden O
cause O
we O
seek O
? O
Let O
us O
try O
. O
But O
in O
a O
matter O
like O
this O
, O
subtlety O
appeals O
to O
subtlety O
, O
and O
without O
imagination O
no O
man O
can O
follow O
another O
into O
these O
halls O
. O
And O
though O
, O
doubtless O
, O
some O
at O
least O
of O
the O
imaginative O
impressions O
about O
to O
be O
presented O
may O
have O
been O
shared O
by O
most O
men O
, O
yet O
few O
perhaps O
were O
entirely O
conscious O
of O
them O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
therefore O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
recall O
them O
now O
. O
Why O
to O
the O
man O
of O
untutored O
ideality O
, O
who O
happens O
to O
be O
but O
loosely O
acquainted O
with O
the O
peculiar O
character O
of O
the O
day O
, O
does O
the O
bare O
mention O
of O
Whitsuntide O
marshal O
in O
the O
fancy O
such O
long O
, O
dreary O
, O
speechless O
processions O
of O
slow-pacing O
pilgrims O
, O
down-cast O
and O
hooded O
with O
new-fallen O
snow O
? O
Or O
to O
the O
unread O
, O
unsophisticated O
Protestant O
of O
the O
Middle O
American O
States O
, O
why O
does O
the O
passing O
mention O
of O
a O
White O
Friar O
or O
a O
White O
Nun O
, O
evoke O
such O
an O
eyeless O
statue O
in O
the O
soul O
? O
Or O
what O
is O
there O
apart O
from O
the O
traditions O
of O
dungeoned O
warriors O
and O
kings O
( O
which O
will O
not O
wholly O
account O
for O
it O
) O
that O
makes O
the O
White O
Tower O
of O
London O
tell O
so O
much O
more O
strongly O
on O
the O
imagination O
of O
an O
untravelled O
American O
, O
than O
those O
other O
storied O
structures O
, O
its O
neighbors—the O
Byward O
Tower O
, O
or O
even O
the O
Bloody O
? O
And O
those O
sublimer O
towers O
, O
the O
White O
Mountains O
of O
New O
Hampshire O
, O
whence O
, O
in O
peculiar O
moods O
, O
comes O
that O
gigantic O
ghostliness O
over O
the O
soul O
at O
the O
bare O
mention O
of O
that O
name O
, O
while O
the O
thought O
of O
Virginia O
's O
Blue O
Ridge O
is O
full O
of O
a O
soft O
, O
dewy O
, O
distant O
dreaminess O
? O
Or O
why O
, O
irrespective O
of O
all O
latitudes O
and O
longitudes O
, O
does O
the O
name O
of O
the O
White O
Sea O
exert O
such O
a O
spectralness O
over O
the O
fancy O
, O
while O
that O
of O
the O
Yellow O
Sea O
lulls O
us O
with O
mortal O
thoughts O
of O
long O
lacquered O
mild O
afternoons O
on O
the O
waves O
, O
followed O
by O
the O
gaudiest O
and O
yet O
sleepiest O
of O
sunsets O
? O
Or O
, O
to O
choose O
a O
wholly O
unsubstantial O
instance O
, O
purely O
addressed O
to O
the O
fancy O
, O
why O
, O
in O
reading O
the O
old O
fairy O
tales O
of O
Central O
Europe O
, O
does O
" O
the O
tall O
pale O
man O
" O
of O
the O
Hartz O
forests O
, O
whose O
changeless O
pallor O
unrestingly O
glides O
through O
the O
green O
of O
the O
groves—why O
is O
this O
phantom O
more O
terrible O
than O
all O
the O
whooping O
imps O
of O
the O
Blocksburg O
? O
Nor O
is O
it O
, O
altogether O
, O
the O
remembrance O
of O
her O
cathedral-toppling O
earthquakes O
; O
nor O
the O
stampedoes O
of O
her O
frantic O
seas O
; O
nor O
the O
tearlessness O
of O
arid O
skies O
that O
never O
rain O
; O
nor O
the O
sight O
of O
her O
wide O
field O
of O
leaning O
spires O
, O
wrenched O
cope-stones O
, O
and O
crosses O
all O
adroop O
( O
like O
canted O
yards O
of O
anchored O
fleets O
) O
; O
and O
her O
suburban O
avenues O
of O
house-walls O
lying O
over O
upon O
each O
other O
, O
as O
a O
tossed O
pack O
of O
cards O
; O
—it O
is O
not O
these O
things O
alone O
which O
make O
tearless O
Lima O
, O
the O
strangest O
, O
saddest O
city O
thou O
can'st O
see O
. O
For O
Lima O
has O
taken O
the O
white O
veil O
; O
and O
there O
is O
a O
higher O
horror O
in O
this O
whiteness O
of O
her O
woe O
. O
Old O
as O
Pizarro O
, O
this O
whiteness O
keeps O
her O
ruins O
for O
ever O
new O
; O
admits O
not O
the O
cheerful O
greenness O
of O
complete O
decay O
; O
spreads O
over O
her O
broken O
ramparts O
the O
rigid O
pallor O
of O
an O
apoplexy O
that O
fixes O
its O
own O
distortions O
. O
I O
know O
that O
, O
to O
the O
common O
apprehension O
, O
this O
phenomenon O
of O
whiteness O
is O
not O
confessed O
to O
be O
the O
prime O
agent O
in O
exaggerating O
the O
terror O
of O
objects O
otherwise O
terrible O
; O
nor O
to O
the O
unimaginative O
mind O
is O
there O
aught O
of O
terror O
in O
those O
appearances O
whose O
awfulness O
to O
another O
mind O
almost O
solely O
consists O
in O
this O
one O
phenomenon O
, O
especially O
when O
exhibited O
under O
any O
form O
at O
all O
approaching O
to O
muteness O
or O
universality O
. O
What O
I O
mean O
by O
these O
two O
statements O
may O
perhaps O
be O
respectively O
elucidated O
by O
the O
following O
examples O
. O
First O
: O
The O
mariner O
, O
when O
drawing O
nigh O
the O
coasts O
of O
foreign O
lands O
, O
if O
by O
night O
he O
hear O
the O
roar O
of O
breakers O
, O
starts O
to O
vigilance O
, O
and O
feels O
just O
enough O
of O
trepidation O
to O
sharpen O
all O
his O
faculties O
; O
but O
under O
precisely O
similar O
circumstances O
, O
let O
him O
be O
called O
from O
his O
hammock O
to O
view O
his O
ship O
sailing O
through O
a O
midnight O
sea O
of O
milky O
whiteness—as O
if O
from O
encircling O
headlands O
shoals O
of O
combed O
white O
bears O
were O
swimming O
round O
him O
, O
then O
he O
feels O
a O
silent O
, O
superstitious O
dread O
; O
the O
shrouded O
phantom O
of O
the O
whitened O
waters O
is O
horrible O
to O
him O
as O
a O
real O
ghost O
; O
in O
vain O
the O
lead O
assures O
him O
he O
is O
still O
off O
soundings O
; O
heart O
and O
helm O
they O
both O
go O
down O
; O
he O
never O
rests O
till O
blue O
water O
is O
under O
him O
again O
. O
Yet O
where O
is O
the O
mariner O
who O
will O
tell O
thee O
, O
" O
Sir O
, O
it O
was O
not O
so O
much O
the O
fear O
of O
striking O
hidden O
rocks O
, O
as O
the O
fear O
of O
that O
hideous O
whiteness O
that O
so O
stirred O
me O
? O
" O
Second O
: O
To O
the O
native O
Indian O
of O
Peru O
, O
the O
continual O
sight O
of O
the O
snowhowdahed O
Andes O
conveys O
naught O
of O
dread O
, O
except O
, O
perhaps O
, O
in O
the O
mere O
fancying O
of O
the O
eternal O
frosted O
desolateness O
reigning O
at O
such O
vast O
altitudes O
, O
and O
the O
natural O
conceit O
of O
what O
a O
fearfulness O
it O
would O
be O
to O
lose O
oneself O
in O
such O
inhuman O
solitudes O
. O
Much O
the O
same O
is O
it O
with O
the O
backwoodsman O
of O
the O
West O
, O
who O
with O
comparative O
indifference O
views O
an O
unbounded O
prairie O
sheeted O
with O
driven O
snow O
, O
no O
shadow O
of O
tree O
or O
twig O
to O
break O
the O
fixed O
trance O
of O
whiteness O
. O
Not O
so O
the O
sailor O
, O
beholding O
the O
scenery O
of O
the O
Antarctic O
seas O
; O
where O
at O
times O
, O
by O
some O
infernal O
trick O
of O
legerdemain O
in O
the O
powers O
of O
frost O
and O
air O
, O
he O
, O
shivering O
and O
half O
shipwrecked O
, O
instead O
of O
rainbows O
speaking O
hope O
and O
solace O
to O
his O
misery O
, O
views O
what O
seems O
a O
boundless O
churchyard O
grinning O
upon O
him O
with O
its O
lean O
ice O
monuments O
and O
splintered O
crosses O
. O
But O
thou O
sayest O
, O
methinks O
this O
white-lead O
chapter O
about O
whiteness O
is O
but O
a O
white O
flag O
hung O
out O
from O
a O
craven O
soul O
; O
thou O
surrenderest O
to O
a O
hypo O
, O
Ishmael O
. O
Tell O
me O
, O
why O
this O
strong O
young O
colt O
, O
foaled O
in O
some O
peaceful O
valley O
of O
Vermont O
, O
far O
removed O
from O
all O
beasts O
of O
prey—why O
is O
it O
that O
upon O
the O
sunniest O
day O
, O
if O
you O
but O
shake O
a O
fresh O
buffalo O
robe O
behind O
him O
, O
so O
that O
he O
can O
not O
even O
see O
it O
, O
but O
only O
smells O
its O
wild O
animal O
muskiness—why O
will O
he O
start O
, O
snort O
, O
and O
with O
bursting O
eyes O
paw O
the O
ground O
in O
phrensies O
of O
affright O
? O
There O
is O
no O
remembrance O
in O
him O
of O
any O
gorings O
of O
wild O
creatures O
in O
his O
green O
northern O
home O
, O
so O
that O
the O
strange O
muskiness O
he O
smells O
can O
not O
recall O
to O
him O
anything O
associated O
with O
the O
experience O
of O
former O
perils O
; O
for O
what O
knows O
he O
, O
this O
New O
England O
colt O
, O
of O
the O
black O
bisons O
of O
distant O
Oregon O
? O
No O
; O
but O
here O
thou O
beholdest O
even O
in O
a O
dumb O
brute O
, O
the O
instinct O
of O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
demonism O
in O
the O
world O
. O
Though O
thousands O
of O
miles O
from O
Oregon O
, O
still O
when O
he O
smells O
that O
savage O
musk O
, O
the O
rending O
, O
goring O
bison O
herds O
are O
as O
present O
as O
to O
the O
deserted O
wild O
foal O
of O
the O
prairies O
, O
which O
this O
instant O
they O
may O
be O
trampling O
into O
dust O
. O
Thus O
, O
then O
, O
the O
muffled O
rollings O
of O
a O
milky O
sea O
; O
the O
bleak O
rustlings O
of O
the O
festooned O
frosts O
of O
mountains O
; O
the O
desolate O
shiftings O
of O
the O
windrowed O
snows O
of O
prairies O
; O
all O
these O
, O
to O
Ishmael O
, O
are O
as O
the O
shaking O
of O
that O
buffalo O
robe O
to O
the O
frightened O
colt O
! O
Though O
neither O
knows O
where O
lie O
the O
nameless O
things O
of O
which O
the O
mystic O
sign O
gives O
forth O
such O
hints O
; O
yet O
with O
me O
, O
as O
with O
the O
colt O
, O
somewhere O
those O
things O
must O
exist O
. O
Though O
in O
many O
of O
its O
aspects O
this O
visible O
world O
seems O
formed O
in O
love O
, O
the O
invisible O
spheres O
were O
formed O
in O
fright O
. O
But O
not O
yet O
have O
we O
solved O
the O
incantation O
of O
this O
whiteness O
, O
and O
learned O
why O
it O
appeals O
with O
such O
power O
to O
the O
soul O
; O
and O
more O
strange O
and O
far O
more O
portentous—why O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
it O
is O
at O
once O
the O
most O
meaning O
symbol O
of O
spiritual O
things O
, O
nay O
, O
the O
very O
veil O
of O
the O
Christian O
's O
Deity O
; O
and O
yet O
should O
be O
as O
it O
is O
, O
the O
intensifying O
agent O
in O
things O
the O
most O
appalling O
to O
mankind O
. O
Is O
it O
that O
by O
its O
indefiniteness O
it O
shadows O
forth O
the O
heartless O
voids O
and O
immensities O
of O
the O
universe O
, O
and O
thus O
stabs O
us O
from O
behind O
with O
the O
thought O
of O
annihilation O
, O
when O
beholding O
the O
white O
depths O
of O
the O
milky O
way O
? O
Or O
is O
it O
, O
that O
as O
in O
essence O
whiteness O
is O
not O
so O
much O
a O
color O
as O
the O
visible O
absence O
of O
color O
; O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
concrete O
of O
all O
colors O
; O
is O
it O
for O
these O
reasons O
that O
there O
is O
such O
a O
dumb O
blankness O
, O
full O
of O
meaning O
, O
in O
a O
wide O
landscape O
of O
snows—a O
colorless O
, O
all-color O
of O
atheism O
from O
which O
we O
shrink O
? O
And O
when O
we O
consider O
that O
other O
theory O
of O
the O
natural O
philosophers O
, O
that O
all O
other O
earthly O
hues—every O
stately O
or O
lovely O
emblazoning—the O
sweet O
tinges O
of O
sunset O
skies O
and O
woods O
; O
yea O
, O
and O
the O
gilded O
velvets O
of O
butterflies O
, O
and O
the O
butterfly O
cheeks O
of O
young O
girls O
; O
all O
these O
are O
but O
subtile O
deceits O
, O
not O
actually O
inherent O
in O
substances O
, O
but O
only O
laid O
on O
from O
without O
; O
so O
that O
all O
deified O
Nature O
absolutely O
paints O
like O
the O
harlot O
, O
whose O
allurements O
cover O
nothing O
but O
the O
charnel-house O
within O
; O
and O
when O
we O
proceed O
further O
, O
and O
consider O
that O
the O
mystical O
cosmetic O
which O
produces O
every O
one O
of O
her O
hues O
, O
the O
great O
principle O
of O
light O
, O
for O
ever O
remains O
white O
or O
colorless O
in O
itself O
, O
and O
if O
operating O
without O
medium O
upon O
matter O
, O
would O
touch O
all O
objects O
, O
even O
tulips O
and O
roses O
, O
with O
its O
own O
blank O
tinge—pondering O
all O
this O
, O
the O
palsied O
universe O
lies O
before O
us O
a O
leper O
; O
and O
like O
wilful O
travellers O
in O
Lapland O
, O
who O
refuse O
to O
wear O
colored O
and O
coloring O
glasses O
upon O
their O
eyes O
, O
so O
the O
wretched O
infidel O
gazes O
himself O
blind O
at O
the O
monumental O
white O
shroud O
that O
wraps O
all O
the O
prospect O
around O
him O
. O
And O
of O
all O
these O
things O
the O
Albino O
whale O
was O
the O
symbol O
. O
Wonder O
ye O
then O
at O
the O
fiery O
hunt O
? O

↑ O
With O
reference O
to O
the O
Polar O
bear O
, O
it O
may O
possibly O
be O
urged O
by O
him O
who O
would O
fain O
go O
still O
deeper O
into O
this O
matter O
, O
that O
it O
is O
not O
the O
whiteness O
, O
separately O
regarded O
, O
which O
heightens O
the O
intolerable O
hideousness O
of O
that O
brute O
; O
for O
, O
analysed O
, O
that O
heightened O
hideousness O
, O
it O
might O
be O
said O
, O
only O
rises O
from O
the O
circumstance O
, O
that O
the O
irresponsible O
ferociousness O
of O
the O
creature O
stands O
invested O
in O
the O
fleece O
of O
celestial O
innocence O
and O
love O
; O
and O
hence O
, O
by O
bringing O
together O
two O
such O
opposite O
emotions O
in O
our O
minds O
, O
the O
Polar O
bear O
frightens O
us O
with O
so O
unnatural O
a O
contrast O
. O
But O
even O
assuming O
all O
this O
to O
be O
true O
; O
yet O
, O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
whiteness O
, O
you O
would O
not O
have O
that O
intensified O
terror O
. O
As O
for O
the O
white O
shark O
, O
the O
white O
gliding O
ghostliness O
of O
repose O
in O
that O
creature O
, O
when O
beheld O
in O
his O
ordinary O
moods O
, O
strangely O
tallies O
with O
the O
same O
quality O
in O
the O
Polar O
quadruped O
. O
This O
peculiarity O
is O
most O
vividly O
hit O
by O
the O
French O
in O
the O
name O
they O
bestow O
upon O
that O
fish O
. O
The O
Romish O
mass O
for O
the O
dead O
begins O
with O
" O
Requiem O
eternam O
" O
( O
eternal O
rest O
) O
, O
whence O
Requiem O
denominating O
the O
mass O
itself O
, O
and O
any O
other O
funeral O
music O
. O
Now O
, O
in O
allusion O
to O
the O
white O
, O
silent O
stillness O
of O
death O
in O
this O
shark O
, O
and O
the O
mild O
deadliness O
of O
his O
habits O
, O
the O
French O
call O
him O
Requin O
. O
↑ O
I O
remember O
the O
first O
albatross O
I O
ever O
saw O
. O
It O
was O
during O
a O
prolonged O
gale O
, O
in O
waters O
hard O
upon O
the O
Antarctic O
seas O
. O
From O
my O
forenoon O
watch O
below O
, O
I O
ascended O
to O
the O
overclouded O
deck O
; O
and O
there O
, O
dashed O
upon O
the O
main O
hatches O
, O
I O
saw O
a O
regal O
, O
feathery O
thing O
of O
unspotted O
whiteness O
, O
and O
with O
a O
hooked O
, O
Roman O
bill O
sublime O
. O
At O
intervals O
, O
it O
arched O
forth O
its O
vast O
archangel O
wings O
, O
as O
if O
to O
embrace O
some O
holy O
ark O
. O
Wondrous O
flutterings O
and O
throbbings O
shook O
it O
. O
Though O
bodily O
unharmed O
, O
it O
uttered O
cries O
, O
as O
some O
king O
's O
ghost O
in O
supernatural O
distress O
. O
Through O
its O
inexpressible O
, O
strange O
eyes O
, O
methought O
I O
peeped O
to O
secrets O
which O
took O
hold O
of O
God O
. O
As O
Abraham O
before O
the O
angels O
, O
I O
bowed O
myself O
; O
the O
white O
thing O
was O
so O
white O
, O
its O
wings O
so O
wide O
, O
and O
in O
those O
for O
ever O
exiled O
waters O
, O
I O
had O
lost O
the O
miserable O
warping O
memories O
of O
traditions O
and O
of O
towns O
. O
Long O
I O
gazed O
at O
that O
prodigy O
of O
plumage O
. O
I O
can O
not O
tell O
, O
can O
only O
hint O
, O
the O
things O
that O
darted O
through O
me O
then O
. O
But O
at O
last O
I O
awoke O
; O
and O
turning O
, O
asked O
a O
sailor O
what O
bird O
was O
this O
. O
A O
goney O
, O
he O
replied O
. O
Goney O
! O
never O
had O
heard O
that O
name O
before O
; O
is O
it O
conceivable O
that O
this O
glorious O
thing O
is O
utterly O
unknown O
to O
men O
ashore O
! O
never O
! O
But O
some O
time O
after O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
goney O
was O
some O
seaman O
's O
name O
for O
albatross O
. O
So O
that O
by O
no O
possibility O
could O
Coleridge O
's O
wild O
Rhyme O
have O
had O
aught O
to O
do O
with O
those O
mystical O
impressions O
which O
were O
mine O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
bird O
upon O
our O
deck O
. O
For O
neither O
had O
I O
then O
read O
the O
Rhyme O
, O
nor O
knew O
the O
bird O
to O
be O
an O
albatross O
. O
Yet O
, O
in O
saying O
this O
, O
I O
do O
but O
indirectly O
burnish O
a O
little O
brighter O
the O
noble O
merit O
of O
the O
poem O
and O
the O
poet O
. O
I O
assert O
, O
then O
, O
that O
in O
the O
wondrous O
bodily O
whiteness O
of O
the O
bird O
chiefly O
lurks O
the O
secret O
of O
the O
spell O
; O
a O
truth O
the O
more O
evinced O
in O
this O
, O
that O
by O
a O
solecism O
of O
terms O
there O
are O
birds O
called O
grey O
albatrosses O
; O
and O
these O
I O
have O
frequently O
seen O
, O
but O
never O
with O
such O
emotions O
as O
when O
I O
beheld O
the O
Antarctic O
fowl O
. O
But O
how O
had O
the O
mystic O
thing O
been O
caught O
? O
Whisper O
it O
not O
, O
and O
I O
will O
tell O
; O
with O
a O
treacherous O
hook O
and O
line O
, O
as O
the O
fowl O
floated O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
At O
last O
the O
Captain O
made O
a O
postman O
of O
it O
; O
tying O
a O
lettered O
, O
leathern O
tally O
round O
its O
neck O
, O
with O
the O
ship O
's O
time O
and O
place O
; O
and O
then O
letting O
it O
escape O
. O
But O
I O
doubt O
not O
, O
that O
leathern O
tally O
, O
meant O
for O
man O
, O
was O
taken O
off O
in O
Heaven O
, O
when O
the O
white O
fowl O
flew O
to O
join O
the O
wing-folding O
, O
the O
invoking O
, O
and O
adoring O
cherubim O
! O
