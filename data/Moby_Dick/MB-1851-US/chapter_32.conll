Already O
we O
are O
boldly O
launched O
upon O
the O
deep O
; O
but O
soon O
we O
shall O
be O
lost O
in O
its O
unshored O
harborless O
immensities O

Ere O
that O
come O
to O

ere O
the O

side O
with O
the O
barnacled O
hulls O
of O
the O
leviathan O
; O
at O
the O
outset O
it O
is O
but O
well O
to O
attend O
to O
a O
matter O
almost O
indispensable O
to O
a O
thorough O
appreciative O
understanding O
of O
the O
more O
special O
leviathanic O
revelations O
and O
allusions O
of O
all O
sorts O
which O
are O
to O
follow O

It O
is O
some O
systematized O
exhibition O
of O
the O

in O
his O
broad O
genera O

that O
I O
would O
now O

put O

no O

all O

the O

Of O
the O
names O
in O
this O
list O
of O
whale O
authors O
, O
only O
those O
following O
Owen O
ever O
saw O
living O
whales O
; O
and O
but O
one O
of O
them O
was O
a O
real O
professional O
harpooneer O
and O
whaleman O
. O
I O
mean O
Captain O
Scoresby O
. O
On O
the O
separate O
subject O
of O
the O
Greenland O
or O
right-whale O
, O
he O
is O
the O
best O
existing O
authority O
. O
But O
Scoresby O
knew O
nothing O
and O
says O
nothing O
of O
the O
great O
sperm O
whale O
, O
compared O
with O
which O
the O
Greenland O
whale O
is O
almost O
unworthy O
mentioning O
. O
And O
here O
be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
the O
Greenland O
whale O
is O
an O
usurper O
upon O
the O
throne O
of O
the O
seas O
. O
He O
is O
not O
even O
by O
any O
means O
the O
largest O
of O
the O
whales O
. O
Yet O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
long O
priority O
of O
his O
claims O
, O
and O
the O
profound O
ignorance O
which O
till O
some O
seventy O
years O
back O
, O
invested O
the O
then O
fabulous O
and O
utterly O
unknown O
sperm-whale O
, O
and O
which O
ignorance O
to O
this O
present O
day O
still O
reigns O
in O
all O
but O
some O
few O
scientific O
retreats O
and O
whale-ports O
; O
this O
usurpation O
has O
been O
every O
way O
complete O
. O
Reference O
to O
nearly O
all O
the O
leviathanic O
allusions O
in O
the O
great O
poets O
of O
past O
days O
, O
will O
satisfy O
you O
that O
the O
Greenland O
whale O
, O
without O
one O
rival O
, O
was O
to O
them O
the O
monarch O
of O
the O
seas O
. O
But O
the O
time O
has O
at O
last O
come O
for O
a O
new O
proclamation O
. O
This O
is O
Charing O
Cross O
; O
hear O
ye O
! O
good O
people O
all O
, O
—the O
Greenland O
whale O
is O
deposed O
, O
—the O
great O
sperm O
whale O
now O
reigneth O
! O
There O
are O
only O
two O
books O
in O
being O
which O
at O
all O
pretend O
to O
put O
the O
living O
sperm O
whale O
before O
you O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
in O
the O
remotest O
degree O
succeed O
in O
the O
attempt O
. O
Those O
books O
are O
Beale O
's O
and O
Bennett O
's O
; O
both O
in O
their O
time O
surgeons O
to O
the O
English O
South-Sea O
whale-ships O
, O
and O
both O
exact O
and O
reliable O
men O
. O
The O
original O
matter O
touching O
the O
sperm O
whale O
to O
be O
found O
in O
their O
volumes O
is O
necessarily O
small O
; O
but O
so O
far O
as O
it O
goes O
, O
it O
is O
of O
excellent O
quality O
, O
though O
mostly O
confined O
to O
scientific O
description O
. O
As O
yet O
, O
however O
, O
the O
sperm O
whale O
, O
scientific O
or O
poetic O
, O
lives O
not O
complete O
in O
any O
literature O
. O
Far O
above O
all O
other O
hunted O
whales O
, O
his O
is O
an O
unwritten O
life O
. O
Now O
the O
various O
species O
of O
whales O
need O
some O
sort O
of O
popular O
comprehensive O
classification O
, O
if O
only O
an O
easy O
outline O
one O
for O
the O
present O
, O
hereafter O
to O
be O
filled O
in O
all-outward O
its O
departments O
by O
subsequent O
laborers O
. O
As O
no O
better O
man O
advances O
to O
take O
this O
matter O
in O
hand O
, O
I O
hereupon O
offer O
my O
own O
poor O
endeavors O
. O
I O
promise O
nothing O
complete O
; O
because O
any O
human O
thing O
supposed O
to O
be O
complete O
must O
for O
that O
very O
reason O
infallibly O
be O
faulty O
. O
I O
shall O
not O
pretend O
to O
a O
minute O
anatomical O
description O
of O
the O
various O
species O
, O
or—in O
this O
space O
at O
least—to O
much O
of O
any O
description O
. O
My O
object O
here O
is O
simply O
to O
project O
the O
draught O
of O
a O
systematization O
of O
cetology O
. O
I O
am O
the O
architect O
, O
not O
the O
builder O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
ponderous O
task O
; O
no O
ordinary O
letter-sorter O
in O
the O
Post-Office O
is O
equal O
to O
it O
. O
To O
grope O
down O
into O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
after O
them O
; O
to O
have O
one O
's O
hands O
among O
the O
unspeakable O
foundations O
, O
ribs O
, O
and O
very O
pelvis O
of O
the O
world O
; O
this O
is O
a O
fearful O
thing O
. O
What O
am O
I O
that O
I O
should O
essay O
to O
hook O
the O
nose O
of O
this O
leviathan O
! O
The O
awful O
tauntings O
in O
Job O
might O
well O
appal O
me O
. O
" O
Will O
he O
( O
the O
leviathan O
) O
make O
a O
covenant O
with O
thee O
? O
Behold O
the O
hope O
of O
him O
is O
vain O
! O
" O
But O
I O
have O
swam O
through O
libraries O
and O
sailed O
through O
oceans O
; O
I O
have O
had O
to O
do O
with O
whales O
with O
these O
visible O
hands O
; O
I O
am O
in O
earnest O
; O
and O
I O
will O
try O
. O
There O
are O
some O
preliminaries O
to O
settle O
. O
First O
: O
The O
uncertain O
, O
unsettled O
condition O
of O
this O
science O
of O
Cetology O
is O
in O
the O
very O
vestibule O
attested O
by O
the O
fact O
, O
that O
in O
some O
quarters O
it O
still O
remains O
a O
moot O
point O
whether O
a O
whale O
be O
a O
fish O
. O
In O
his O
System O
of O
Nature O
, O
A.D. O
1776 O
, O
Linnæus O
declares O
, O
" O
I O
hereby O
separate O
the O
whales O
from O
the O
fish O
. O
" O
But O
of O
my O
own O
knowledge O
, O
I O
know O
that O
down O
to O
the O
year O
1850 O
, O
sharks O
and O
shad O
, O
alewives O
and O
herring O
, O
against O
Linnæus O
's O
express O
edict O
, O
were O
still O
found O
dividing O
the O
possession O
of O
the O
same O
seas O
with O
the O
Leviathan O
. O
The O
grounds O
upon O
which O
Linnaeus O
would O
fain O
have O
banished O
the O
whales O
from O
the O
waters O
, O
he O
states O
as O
follows O
: O
" O
On O
account O
of O
their O
warm O
bilocular O
heart O
, O
their O
lungs O
, O
their O
movable O
eyelids O
, O
their O
hollow O
ears O
, O
penem O
intrantem O
feminam O
mammis O
lactantem O
, O
" O
and O
finally O
, O
" O
ex O
lege O
naturae O
jure O
meritoque O
. O
" O
I O
submitted O
all O
this O
to O
my O
friends O
Simeon O
Macey O
and O
Charley O
Coffin O
, O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
both O
messmates O
of O
mine O
in O
a O
certain O
voyage O
, O
and O
they O
united O
in O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
reasons O
set O
forth O
were O
altogether O
insufficient O
. O
Charley O
profanely O
hinted O
they O
were O
humbug O
. O
Be O
it O
known O
that O
, O
waiving O
all O
argument O
, O
I O
take O
the O
good O
old O
fashioned O
ground O
that O
the O
whale O
is O
a O
fish O
, O
and O
call O
upon O
holy O
Jonah O
to O
back O
me O
. O
This O
fundamental O
thing O
settled O
, O
the O
next O
point O
is O
, O
in O
what O
internal O
respect O
does O
the O
whale O
differ O
from O
other O
fish O
. O
Above O
, O
Linnæus O
has O
given O
you O
those O
items O
. O
But O
in O
brief O
they O
are O
these O
: O
lungs O
and O
warm O
blood O
; O
whereas O
, O
all O
other O
fish O
are O
lungless O
and O
cold O
blooded O
. O
Next O
: O
how O
shall O
we O
define O
the O
whale O
, O
by O
his O
obvious O
externals O
, O
so O
as O
conspicuously O
to O
label O
him O
for O
all O
time O
to O
come O
? O
To O
be O
short O
, O
then O
, O
a O
whale O
is O
a O
spouting O
fish O
with O
a O
horizontal O
tail O
. O
There O
you O
have O
him O
. O
However O
contracted O
, O
that O
definition O
is O
the O
result O
of O
expanded O
meditation O
. O
A O
walrus O
spouts O
much O
like O
a O
whale O
, O
but O
the O
walrus O
is O
not O
a O
fish O
, O
because O
he O
is O
amphibious O
. O
But O
the O
last O
term O
of O
the O
definition O
is O
still O
more O
cogent O
, O
as O
coupled O
with O
the O
first O
. O
Almost O
any O
one O
must O
have O
noticed O
that O
all O
the O
fish O
familiar O
to O
landsmen O
have O
not O
a O
flat O
, O
but O
a O
vertical O
, O
or O
up-and-down O
tail O
. O
Whereas O
, O
among O
spouting O
fish O
the O
tail O
, O
though O
it O
may O
be O
similarly O
shaped O
, O
invariably O
assumes O
a O
horizontal O
position O
. O
By O
the O
above O
definition O
of O
what O
a O
whale O
is O
, O
I O
do O
by O
no O
means O
exclude O
from O
the O
leviathanic O
brotherhood O
any O
sea O
creature O
hitherto O
identified O
with O
the O
whale O
by O
the O
best O
informed O
Nantucketers O
; O
nor O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
link O
with O
it O
any O
fish O
hitherto O
authoritatively O
regarded O
as O
alien O
. O
[ O
1 O
] O
Hence O
, O
all O
the O
smaller O
, O
spouting O
, O
and O
horizontal O
tailed O
fish O
must O
be O
included O
in O
this O
ground-plan O
of O
Cetology O
. O
Now O
, O
then O
, O
come O
the O
grand O
divisions O
of O
the O
entire O
whale O
host O
. O
First O
: O
According O
to O
magnitude O
I O
divide O
the O
whales O
into O
three O
primary O

He O
is O
, O
without O
doubt O
, O
the O
largest O
inhabitant O
of O
the O

; O
the O
most O
formidable O
of O

; O

most O
majestic O
in O
aspect O
; O
and O
lastly O
, O
by O
far O
the O
most O
valuable O
in O
commerce O
; O
he O
being O
the O
only O
creature O
from O
which O
that O
valuable O
substance O
, O
spermaceti O
, O
is O
obtained O
. O
All O
his O
peculiarities O
will O
, O
in O
many O

places O
, O
be O
enlarged O
upon O
. O
It O
is O
chiefly O
with O
his O
name O
that O
I O
now O
have O
to O
do O
. O
Philologically O
considered O
, O
it O
is O
absurd O
. O
Some O
centuries O
ago O
, O
when O
the O
Sperm O
whale O
was O
almost O
wholly O
unknown O
in O
his O
own O
proper O
individuality O
, O
and O
when O
his O
oil O
was O
only O
accidentally O
obtained O
from O
the O
stranded O
fish O
; O
in O
those O
days O
spermaceti O
, O
it O
would O
seem O
, O
was O
popularly O
supposed O
to O
be O
derived O
from O
a O
creature O
identical O
with O
the O
one O
then O
known O
in O
England O
as O
the O
Greenland O
or O
Right O
Whale O
. O
It O
was O
the O
idea O
also O
, O
that O
this O
same O
spermaceti O
was O
that O
quickening O
humor O

that O

upon O
a O
barren O

wondrous O
power O

velocity O
in O

, O
as O
to O

From O
having O
the O

the O

sometimes O
included O

among O
a O

species O
denominated O
Whalebone O

, O
that O
is O

with O

Of O
these O
so-called O
Whalebone O

there O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
several O
varieties O

most O
of O

are O

In O
connexion O
with O
this O
appellative O
of O
" O
Whalebone O
whales O
, O
" O
it O
is O
of O
great O
importance O
to O
mention O
, O
that O
however O
such O
a O
nomenclature O
may O
be O
convenient O
in O
facilitating O
allusions O
to O
some O
kind O
of O
whales O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
in O
vain O
to O
attempt O
a O
clear O
classification O
of O
the O
Leviathan O
, O
founded O
upon O
either O
his O
baleen O
, O
or O
hump O
, O
or O
fin O
, O
or O
teeth O
; O
notwithstanding O
that O
those O
marked O
parts O
or O
features O
very O
obviously O
seem O
better O
adapted O
to O
afford O
the O
basis O
for O
a O
regular O
system O
of O
Cetology O
than O
any O
other O
detached O
bodily O
distinctions O
, O
which O
the O
whale O
, O
in O
his O
kinds O
, O
presents O
. O
How O
then O
? O
The O
baleen O
, O
hump O
, O
back-fin O
, O
and O
teeth O
; O
these O
are O
things O
whose O
peculiarities O
are O
indiscriminately O
dispersed O
among O
all O
sorts O
of O
whales O
, O
without O
any O
regard O
to O
what O
may O
be O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
structure O
in O
other O
and O
more O
essential O
particulars O
. O
Thus O
, O
the O
sperm O
whale O
and O
the O
humpbacked O
whale O
, O
each O
has O
a O
hump O
; O
but O
there O
the O
similitude O
ceases O
. O
Then O
this O
same O
humpbacked O
whale O
and O
the O
Greenland O
whale O
, O
each O
of O
these O
has O
baleen O
; O
but O
there O
again O
the O
similitude O
ceases O
. O
And O
it O
is O
just O
the O
same O
with O
the O
other O
parts O
above O
mentioned O
. O
In O
various O
sorts O
of O
whales O
, O
they O
form O
such O
irregular O
combinations O
; O
or O
, O
in O
the O
case O
of O
any O
one O
of O
them O
detached O
, O
such O
an O
irregular O
isolation O
; O
as O
utterly O
to O
defy O
all O
general O
methodization O
formed O
upon O
such O
a O
basis O
. O
On O
this O
rock O
every O
one O
of O
the O
whale-naturalists O
has O
split O
. O
But O
it O
may O
possibly O
be O
conceived O
that O
, O
in O
the O
internal O
parts O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
in O
his O
anatomy—there O
, O
at O
least O
, O
we O
shall O
be O
able O
to O
hit O
the O
right O
classification O
. O
Nay O
; O
what O
thing O
, O
for O
example O
, O
is O
there O
in O
the O
Greenland O
whale O
's O
anatomy O
more O
striking O
than O
his O
baleen O
? O
Yet O
we O
have O
seen O
that O
by O
his O
baleen O
it O
is O
impos- O
sible O
correctly O
to O
classify O
the O
Greenland O
whale O
. O
And O
if O
you O
descend O
into O
the O
bowels O
of O
the O
various O
leviathans O
, O
why O
there O
you O
will O
not O
find O
distinctions O
a O
fiftieth O
part O
as O
available O
to O
the O
systematizer O
as O
those O
external O
ones O
already O
enumerated O
. O
What O
then O
remains O
? O
nothing O
but O
to O
take O
hold O
of O
the O
whales O
bodily O
, O
in O
their O
entire O
liberal O
volume O
, O
and O
boldly O
sort O
them O
that O
way O
. O
And O
this O
is O
the O
Bibliographical O
system O
here O
adopted O
; O
and O
it O
is O
the O
only O
one O
that O
can O
possibly O
succeed O
, O
for O
it O

the O

capture O

( O

, O
that O
is O
, O
Nostril O
whale.—Another O
instance O
of O
a O
curiously O
named O
whale O
, O
so O
named O
I O
suppose O
from O
his O
peculiar O
horn O
being O
originally O
mistaken O
for O
a O
peaked O
nose O
. O
The O
creature O
is O
some O
sixteen O
feet O
in O
length O
, O
while O
its O
horn O
averages O
five O
feet O
, O
though O
some O
exceed O
ten O
, O
and O
even O
attain O
to O
fifteen O
feet O
. O
Strictly O
speaking O
, O
this O
horn O
is O
but O
a O
lengthened O
tusk O
, O
growing O
out O
from O
the O
jaw O
in O
a O
line O
a O
little O
depressed O
from O
the O
horizontal O
. O
But O
it O
is O
only O
found O
on O
the O
sinister O
side O
, O
which O
has O
an O
ill O
effect O
, O
giving O
its O
owner O
something O
analogous O
to O
the O
aspect O
of O
a O
clumsy O
left-handed O
man O
. O
What O
precise O
purpose O
this O
ivory O
horn O
or O
lance O
answers O
, O
it O
would O
be O
hard O
to O
say O
. O
It O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
used O
like O
the O
blade O
of O
the O
sword-fish O
and O
bill-fish O
; O
though O
some O
sailors O
tell O
me O
that O
the O
Narwhale O
employs O
it O
for O
a O
rake O
in O
turning O
over O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
sea O
for O
food O
. O
Charley O
Coffin O
said O
it O
was O
used O
for O
an O
ice-piercer O
; O
for O
the O
Narwhale O
, O
rising O
to O
the O
surface O
of O
the O
Polar O
Sea O
, O
and O
finding O
it O
sheeted O
with O
ice O
, O
thrusts O
his O
horn O
up O
, O
and O
so O
breaks O
through O
. O
But O
you O
can O
not O
prove O
either O
of O
these O
surmises O
to O
be O
correct O
. O
My O
own O
opinion O
is O
, O
that O
however O
this O
one-sided O
horn O
may O
really O
be O
used O
by O
the O
Narwhale—however O
that O
may O
be—it O
would O
certainly O
be O
very O
convenient O
to O
him O
for O
a O
folder O
in O
reading O
pamphlets O

The O
Narwhale O
I O
have O
heard O
called O
the O
Tusked O
whale O
, O
the O
Horned O
whale O
, O
and O
the O
Unicorn O
whale O
. O
He O
is O
certainly O
a O
curious O
example O
of O
the O
Unicornism O
to O
be O
found O
in O
almost O
every O
kingdom O
of O
animated O
nature O
. O
From O
certain O
cloistered O
old O
authors O
I O
have O
gathered O
that O
this O
same O
sea-unicorn O
's O
horn O
was O
in O
ancient O
days O
regarded O
as O
the O
great O
antidote O
against O
poison O
, O
and O
as O
such O
, O
preparations O
of O
it O
brought O
immense O
prices O
. O
It O
was O
also O
distilled O
to O
a O
volatile O
salts O
for O
fainting O
ladies O
the O
same O
way O
that O
the O
horns O
of O
the O
male O
deer O
are O
manufactured O
into O
hartshorn O
. O
Originally O
it O
was O
in O
itself O
accounted O
an O
object O
of O
great O
curiosity O
. O

to O

a O
prodigious O
long O

of O
the O

for O
a O

From O

I O
should O

that O
he O

more O
than O

something O
must O
be O
done O
to O
distinguish O

I O
call O
him O
thus O
, O
because O
he O
always O
swims O
in O
hilarious O
shoals O
, O
which O
upon O
the O

sea O
keep O
tossing O
themselves O
to O

comprises O
part O

whole O
