In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
I O
wish O
to O
lay O
before O
you O
a O
particular O
, O
plain O
statement O
, O
touching O
the O
living O
bulk O
of O
this O
leviathan O
, O
whose O
skeleton O
we O
are O
briefly O
to O
exhibit O
. O
Such O
a O
statement O
may O
prove O
useful O
here O
. O
According O
to O
a O
careful O
calculation O
I O
have O
made O
, O
and O
which O
I O
partly O
base O
upon O
Captain O
Scoresby O
's O
estimate O
, O
of O
seventy O
tons O
for O
the O
largest O
sized O
Greenland O
whale O
of O
sixty O
feet O
in O
length O
; O
according O
to O
my O
careful O
calculation O
, O
I O
say O
, O
a O
Sperm O
Whale O
of O
the O
largest O
magnitude O
, O
between O
eighty-five O
and O
ninety O
feet O
in O
length O
, O
and O
something O
less O
than O
forty O
feet O
in O
its O
fullest O
circumference O
, O
such O
a O
whale O
will O
weigh O
at O
least O
ninety O
tons O
; O
so O
that O
, O
reckoning O
thirteen O
men O
to O
a O
ton O
, O
he O
would O
considerably O
outweigh O
the O
combined O
population O
of O
a O
whole O
village O
of O
one O
thousand O
one O
hundred O
inhabitants O
. O
Think O
you O
not O
then O
that O
brains O
, O
like O
yoked O
cattle O
, O
should O
be O
put O
to O
this O
leviathan O
, O
to O
make O
him O
at O
all O
budge O
to O
any O
landsman O
's O
imagination O
? O
Having O
already O
in O
various O
ways O
put O
before O
you O
his O
skull O
, O
spout-hole O
, O
jaw O
, O
teeth O
, O
tail O
, O
forehead O
, O
fins O
, O
and O
divers O
other O
parts O
, O
I O
shall O
now O
simply O
point O
out O
what O
is O
most O
interesting O
in O
the O
general O
bulk O
of O
his O
unobstructed O
bones O
. O
But O
as O
the O
colossal O
skull O
embraces O
so O
very O
large O
a O
proportion O
of O
the O
entire O
extent O
of O
the O
skeleton O
; O
as O
it O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
complicated O
part O
; O
and O
as O
nothing O
is O
to O
be O
repeated O
concerning O
it O
in O
this O
chapter O
, O
you O
must O
not O
fail O
to O
carry O
it O
in O
your O
mind O
, O
or O
under O
your O
arm O
, O
as O
we O
proceed O
, O
otherwise O
you O
will O
not O
gain O
a O
complete O
notion O
of O
the O
general O
structure O
we O
are O
about O
to O
view O
. O
In O
length O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
skeleton O
at O
Tranque O
measured O
seventy-two O
feet O
; O
so O
that O
when O
fully O
invested O
and O
extended O
in O
life O
, O
he O
must O
have O
been O
ninety O
feet O
long O
; O
for O
in O
the O
whale O
, O
the O
skeleton O
loses O
about O
one O
fifth O
in O
length O
compared O
with O
the O
living O
body O
. O
Of O
this O
seventy-two O
feet O
, O
his O
skull O
and O
jaw O
comprised O
some O
twenty O
feet O
, O
leaving O
some O
fifty O
feet O
of O
plain O
back-bone O
. O
Attached O
to O
this O
back-bone O
, O
for O
something O
less O
than O
a O
third O
of O
its O
length O
, O
was O
the O
mighty O
circular O
basket O
of O
ribs O
which O
once O
enclosed O
his O
vitals O
. O
To O
me O
this O
vast O
ivory-ribbed O
chest O
, O
with O
the O
long O
, O
unrelieved O
spine O
, O
extending O
far O
away O
from O
it O
in O
a O
straight O
line O
, O
not O
a O
little O
resembled O
the O
hull O
of O
a O
great O
ship O
new-laid O
upon O
the O
stocks O
, O
when O
only O
some O
twenty O
of O
her O
naked O
bow-ribs O
are O
inserted O
, O
and O
the O
keel O
is O
otherwise O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
but O
a O
long O
, O
disconnected O
timber O
. O
The O
ribs O
were O
ten O
on O
a O
side O
. O
The O
first O
, O
to O
begin O
from O
the O
neck O
, O
was O
nearly O
six O
feet O
long O
; O
the O
second O
, O
third O
, O
and O
fourth O
were O
each O
successively O
longer O
, O
till O
you O
came O
to O
the O
climax O
of O
the O
fifth O
, O
or O
one O
of O
the O
middle O
ribs O
, O
which O
measured O
eight O
feet O
and O
some O
inches O
. O
From O
that O
part O
, O
the O
remaining O
ribs O
diminished O
, O
till O
the O
tenth O
and O
last O
only O
spanned O
five O
feet O
and O
some O
inches O
. O
In O
general O
thickness O
, O
they O
all O
bore O
a O
seemly O
correspondence O
to O
their O
length O
. O
The O
middle O
ribs O
were O
the O
most O
arched O
. O
In O
some O
of O
the O
Arsacides O
they O
are O
used O
for O
beams O
whereon O
to O
lay O
footpath O
bridges O
over O
small O
streams O
. O
In O
considering O
these O
ribs O
, O
I O
could O
not O
but O
be O
struck O
anew O
with O
the O
circumstance O
, O
so O
variously O
repeated O
in O
this O
book O
, O
that O
the O
skeleton O
of O
the O
whale O
is O
by O
no O
means O
the O
mould O
of O
his O
invested O
form O
. O
The O
largest O
of O
the O
Tranque O
ribs O
, O
one O
of O
the O
middle O
ones O
, O
occupied O
that O
part O
of O
the O
fish O
which O
, O
in O
life O
, O
is O
greatest O
in O
depth O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
greatest O
depth O
of O
the O
invested O
body O
of O
this O
particular O
whale O
must O
have O
been O
at O
least O
sixteen O
feet O
; O
whereas O
, O
the O
corresponding O
rib O
measured O
but O
little O
more O
than O
eight O
feet O
. O
So O
that O
this O
rib O
only O
conveyed O
half O
of O
the O
true O
notion O
of O
the O
living O
magnitude O
of O
that O
part O
. O
Besides O
, O
for O
some O
way O
, O
where O
I O
now O
saw O
but O
a O
naked O
spine O
, O
all O
that O
had O
been O
once O
wrapped O
round O
with O
tons O
of O
added O
bulk O
in O
flesh O
, O
muscle O
, O
blood O
, O
and O
bowels O
. O
Still O
more O
, O
for O
the O
ample O
fins O
, O
I O
here O
saw O
but O
a O
few O
disordered O
joints O
; O
and O
in O
place O
of O
the O
weighty O
and O
majestic O
, O
but O
boneless O
flukes O
, O
an O
utter O
blank O
! O
How O
vain O
and O
foolish O
, O
then O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
for O
timid O
untravelled O
man O
to O
try O
to O
comprehend O
aright O
this O
wondrous O
whale O
, O
by O
merely O
poring O
over O
his O
dead O
attenuated O
skeleton O
, O
stretched O
in O
this O
peaceful O
wood O
. O
No O
. O
Only O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
quickest O
perils O
; O
only O
when O
within O
the O
eddyings O
of O
his O
angry O
flukes O
; O
only O
on O
the O
profound O
unbounded O
sea O
, O
can O
the O
fully O
invested O
whale O
be O
truly O
and O
livingly O
found O
out O
. O
But O
the O
spine O
. O
For O
that O
, O
the O
best O
way O
we O
can O
consider O
it O
is O
, O
with O
a O
crane O
, O
to O
pile O
its O
bones O
high O
up O
on O
end O
. O
No O
speedy O
enterprise O
. O
But O
now O
it O
's O
done O
, O
it O
looks O
much O
like O
Pompey O
's O
Pillar O
. O
There O
are O
forty O
and O
odd O
vertebrae O
in O
all O
, O
which O
in O
the O
skeleton O
are O
not O
locked O
together O
. O
They O
mostly O
lie O
like O
the O
great O
knobbed O
blocks O
on O
a O
Gothic O
spire O
, O
forming O
solid O
courses O
of O
heavy O
masonry O
. O
The O
largest O
, O
a O
middle O
one O
, O
is O
in O
width O
something O
less O
than O
three O
feet O
, O
and O
in O
depth O
more O
than O
four O
. O
The O
smallest O
, O
where O
the O
spine O
tapers O
away O
into O
the O
tail O
, O
is O
only O
two O
inches O
in O
width O
, O
and O
looks O
something O
like O
a O
white O
billiard-ball O
. O
I O
was O
told O
that O
there O
were O
still O
smaller O
ones O
, O
but O
they O
had O
been O
lost O
by O
some O
little O
cannibal O
urchins O
, O
the O
priest O
's O
children O
, O
who O
had O
stolen O
them O
to O
play O
marbles O
with O
. O
Thus O
we O
see O
how O
that O
the O
spine O
of O
even O
the O
hugest O
of O
living O
things O
tapers O
off O
at O
last O
into O
simple O
child O
's O
play O
. O
