I O
stuffed O
a O
shirt O
or O
two O
into O
my O
old O
carpet-bag O
, O
tucked O
it O
under O
my O
arm O
, O
and O
started O
for O
Cape O
Horn O
and O
the O
Pacific O
. O
Quitting O
the O
good O
city O
of O
old O
Manhatto O
, O
I O
duly O
arrived O
in O
New O
Bedford O
. O
It O
was O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
in O
December O
. O
Much O
was O
I O
disappointed O
upon O
learning O
that O
the O
little O
packet O
for O
Nantucket O
had O
already O
sailed O
, O
and O
that O
no O
way O
of O
reaching O
that O
place O
would O
offer O
, O
till O
the O
following O
Monday O
. O
As O
most O
young O
candidates O
for O
the O
pains O
and O
penalties O
of O
whaling O
stop O
at O
this O
same O
New O
Bedford O
, O
thence O
to O
embark O
on O
their O
voyage O
, O
it O
may O
as O
well O
be O
related O
that O
I O
, O
for O
one O
, O
had O
no O
idea O
of O
so O
doing O
. O
For O
my O
mind O
was O
made O
up O
to O
sail O
in O
no O
other O
than O
a O
Nantucket O
craft O
, O
because O
there O
was O
a O
fine O
, O
boisterous O
something O
about O
everything O
connected O
with O
that O
famous O
old O
island O
, O
which O
amazingly O
pleased O
me O
. O
Besides O
though O
New O
Bedford O
has O
of O
late O
been O
gradually O
monopolizing O
the O
business O
of O
whaling O
, O
and O
though O
in O
this O
matter O
poor O
old O
Nantucket O
is O
now O
much O
behind O
her O
, O
yet O
Nantucket O
was O
her O
great O
original—the O
Tyre O
of O
this O
Carthage O
; O
—the O
place O
where O
the O
first O
dead O
American O
whale O
was O
stranded O
. O
Where O
else O
but O
from O
Nantucket O
did O
those O
aboriginal O
whalemen O
, O
the O
Red-Men O
, O
first O
sally O
out O
in O
canoes O
to O
give O
chase O
to O
the O
Leviathan O
? O
And O
where O
but O
from O
Nantucket O
, O
too O
, O
did O
that O
first O
adventurous O
little O
sloop O
put O
forth O
, O
partly O
laden O
with O
imported O
cobble-stones—so O
goes O
the O
story—to O
throw O
at O
the O
whales O
, O
in O
order O
to O
discover O
when O
they O
were O
nigh O
enough O
to O
risk O
a O
harpoon O
from O
the O
bowsprit O
? O
Now O
having O
a O
night O
, O
a O
day O
, O
and O
still O
another O
night O
following O
before O
me O
in O
New O
Bedford O
, O
ere O
I O
could O
embark O
for O
my O
destined O
port O
, O
it O
became O
a O
matter O
of O
concernment O
where O
I O
was O
to O
eat O
and O
sleep O
meanwhile O
. O
It O
was O
a O
very O
dubious-looking O
, O
nay O
, O
a O
very O
dark O
and O
dismal O
night O
, O
bitingly O
cold O
and O
cheerless O
. O
I O
knew O
no O
one O
in O
the O
place O
. O
With O
anxious O
grapnels O
I O
had O
sounded O
my O
pocket O
, O
and O
only O
brought O
up O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O
silver O
, O
—So O
, O
wherever O
you O
go O
, O
Ishmael O
, O
said O
I O
to O
myself O
, O
as O
I O
stood O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
a O
dreary O
street O
shouldering O
my O
bag O
, O
and O
comparing O
the O
gloom O
towards O
the O
north O
with O
the O
darkness O
towards O
the O
south—wherever O
in O
your O
wisdom O
you O
may O
conclude O
to O
lodge O
for O
the O
night O
, O
my O
dear O
Ishmael O
, O
be O
sure O
to O
inquire O
the O
price O
, O
and O
do O
n't O
be O
too O
particular O
. O
With O
halting O
steps O
I O
paced O
the O
streets O
, O
and O
passed O
the O
sign O
of O
" O
The O
Crossed O
Harpoons O
" O
—but O
it O
looked O
too O
expensive O
and O
jolly O
there O
. O
Further O
on O
, O
from O
the O
bright O
red O
windows O
of O
the O
" O
Sword-Fish O
Inn O
, O
" O
there O
came O
such O
fervent O
rays O
, O
that O
it O
seemed O
to O
have O
melted O
the O
packed O
snow O
and O
ice O
from O
before O
the O
house O
, O
for O
everywhere O
else O
the O
congealed O
frost O
lay O
ten O
inches O
thick O
in O
a O
hard O
, O
asphaltic O
pavement O
, O
—rather O
weary O
for O
me O
, O
when O
I O
struck O
my O
foot O
against O
the O
flinty O
projections O
, O
because O
from O
hard O
, O
remorseless O
service O
the O
soles O
of O
my O
boots O
were O
in O
a O
most O
miserable O
plight O
. O
Too O
expensive O
and O
jolly O
, O
again O
thought O
I O
, O
pausing O
one O
moment O
to O
watch O
the O
broad O
glare O
in O
the O
street O
, O
and O
hear O
the O
sounds O
of O
the O
tinkling O
glasses O
within O
. O
But O
go O
on O
, O
Ishmael O
, O
said O
I O
at O
last O
; O
do O
n't O
you O
hear O
? O
get O
away O
from O
before O
the O
door O
; O
your O
patched O
boots O
are O
stopping O
the O
way O
. O
So O
on O
I O
went O
. O
I O
now O
by O
instinct O
followed O
the O
streets O
that O
took O
me O
waterward O
, O
for O
there O
, O
doubtless O
, O
were O
the O
cheapest O
, O
if O
not O
the O
cheeriest O
inns O
. O
Such O
dreary O
streets O
! O
blocks O
of O
blackness O
, O
not O
houses O
, O
on O
either O
hand O
, O
and O
here O
and O
there O
a O
candle O
, O
like O
a O
candle O
moving O
about O
in O
a O
tomb O
. O
At O
this O
hour O
of O
the O
night O
, O
of O
the O
last O
day O
of O
the O
week O
, O
that O
quarter O
of O
the O
town O
proved O
all O
but O
deserted O
. O
But O
presently O
I O
came O
to O
a O
smoky O
light O
proceeding O
from O
a O
low O
, O
wide O
building O
, O
the O
door O
of O
which O
stood O
invitingly O
open O
. O
It O
had O
a O
careless O
look O
, O
as O
if O
it O
were O
meant O
for O
the O
uses O
of O
the O
public O
; O
so O
, O
entering O
, O
the O
first O
thing O
I O
did O
was O
to O
stumble O
over O
an O
ash-box O
in O
the O
porch O
. O
Ha O
! O
thought O
I O
, O
ha O
, O
as O
the O
flying O
particles O
almost O
choked O
me O
, O
are O
these O
ashes O
from O
that O
destroyed O
city O
, O
Gomorrah O
? O
But O
" O
The O
Crossed O
Harpoons O
, O
" O
and O
" O
The O
Sword-Fish O
? O
" O
—this O
, O
then O
, O
must O
needs O
be O
the O
sign O
of O
" O
The O
Trap O
. O
" O
However O
, O
I O
picked O
myself O
up O
and O
hearing O
a O
loud O
voice O
within O
, O
pushed O
on O
and O
opened O
a O
second O
, O
interior O
door O
. O
It O
seemed O
the O
great O
Black O
Parliament O
sitting O
in O
Tophet O
. O
A O
hundred O
black O
faces O
turned O
round O
in O
their O
rows O
to O
peer O
; O
and O
beyond O
, O
a O
black O
Angel O
of O
Doom O
was O
beating O
a O
book O
in O
a O
pulpit O
. O
It O
was O
a O
negro O
church O
; O
and O
the O
preacher O
's O
text O
was O
about O
the O
blackness O
of O
darkness O
, O
and O
the O
weeping O
and O
wailing O
and O
teeth-gnashing O
there O
. O
Ha O
, O
Ishmael O
, O
muttered O
I O
, O
backing O
out O
, O
Wretched O
entertainment O
at O
the O
sign O
of O
" O
The O
Trap O
! O
" O
Moving O
on O
, O
I O
at O
last O
came O
to O
a O
dim O
sort O
of O
light O
not O
far O
from O
the O
docks O
, O
and O
heard O
a O
forlorn O
creaking O
in O
the O
air O
; O
and O
looking O
up O
, O
saw O
a O
swinging O
sign O
over O
the O
door O
with O
a O
white O
painting O
upon O
it O
, O
faintly O
representing O
a O
tall O
straight O
jet O
of O
misty O
spray O
, O
and O
these O
words O
underneath— O
" O
The O
Spouter-Inn O
: O
—Peter O
Coffin O
. O
" O
Coffin O
? O
—Spouter O
? O
—Rather O
ominous O
in O
that O
particular O
connexion O
, O
thought O
I O
. O
But O
it O
is O
a O
common O
name O
in O
Nantucket O
, O
they O
say O
, O
and O
I O
suppose O
this O
Peter O
here O
is O
an O
emigrant O
from O
there O
. O
As O
the O
light O
looked O
so O
dim O
, O
and O
the O
place O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
looked O
quiet O
enough O
, O
and O
the O
dilapidated O
little O
wooden O
house O
itself O
looked O
as O
if O
it O
might O
have O
been O
carted O
here O
from O
the O
ruins O
of O
some O
burnt O
district O
, O
and O
as O
the O
swinging O
sign O
had O
a O
poverty-stricken O
sort O
of O
creak O
to O
it O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
here O
was O
the O
very O
spot O
for O
cheap O
lodgings O
, O
and O
the O
best O
of O
pea O
coffee O
. O
It O
was O
a O
queer O
sort O
of O
place—a O
gable-ended O
old O
house O
, O
one O
side O
palsied O
as O
it O
were O
, O
and O
leaning O
over O
sadly O
. O
It O
stood O
on O
a O
sharp O
bleak O
corner O
, O
where O
that O
tempestuous O
wind O
Euroclydon O
kept O
up O
a O
worse O
howling O
than O
ever O
it O
did O
about O
poor O
Paul O
's O
tossed O
craft O
. O
Euroclydon O
, O
nevertheless O
, O
is O
a O
mighty O
pleasant O
zephyr O
to O
any O
one O
in-doors O
, O
with O
his O
feet O
on O
the O
hob O
quietly O
toasting O
for O
bed O
. O
" O
In O
judging O
of O
that O
tempestuous O
wind O
called O
Euroclydon O
, O
" O
says O
an O
old O
writer—of O
whose O
works O
I O
possess O
the O
only O
copy O
extant— O
" O
it O
maketh O
a O
marvellous O
difference O
, O
whether O
thou O
lookest O
out O
at O
it O
from O
a O
glass O
window O
where O
the O
frost O
is O
all O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
or O
whether O
thou O
observest O
it O
from O
that O
sashless O
window O
, O
where O
the O
frost O
is O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
and O
of O
which O
the O
wight O
Death O
is O
the O
only O
glazier O
. O
" O
True O
enough O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
as O
this O
passage O
occurred O
to O
my O
mind—old O
black-letter O
, O
thou O
reasonest O
well O
. O
Yes O
, O
these O
eyes O
are O
windows O
, O
and O
this O
body O
of O
mine O
is O
the O
house O
. O
What O
a O
pity O
they O
did O
n't O
stop O
up O
the O
chinks O
and O
the O
crannies O
though O
, O
and O
thrust O
in O
a O
little O
lint O
here O
and O
there O
. O
But O
it O
's O
too O
late O
to O
make O
any O
improvements O
now O
. O
The O
universe O
is O
finished O
; O
the O
copestone O
is O
on O
, O
and O
the O
chips O
were O
carted O
off O
a O
million O
years O
ago O
. O
Poor O
Lazarus O
there O
, O
chattering O
his O
teeth O
against O
the O
curbstone O
for O
his O
pillow O
, O
and O
shaking O
off O
his O
tatters O
with O
his O
shiverings O
, O
he O
might O
plug O
up O
both O
ears O
with O
rags O
, O
and O
put O
a O
corn-cob O
into O
his O
mouth O
, O
and O
yet O
that O
would O
not O
keep O
out O
the O
tempestuous O
Euroclydon O
. O
Euroclydon O
! O
says O
old O
Dives O
, O
in O
his O
red O
silken O
wrapper— O
( O
he O
had O
a O
redder O
one O
afterwards O
) O
pooh O
, O
pooh O
! O
What O
a O
fine O
frosty O
night O
; O
how O
Orion O
glitters O
; O
what O
northern O
lights O
! O
Let O
them O
talk O
of O
their O
oriental O
summer O
climes O
of O
everlasting O
conservatories O
; O
give O
me O
the O
privilege O
of O
making O
my O
own O
summer O
with O
my O
own O
coals O
. O
But O
what O
thinks O
Lazarus O
? O
Can O
he O
warm O
his O
blue O
hands O
by O
holding O
them O
up O
to O
the O
grand O
northern O
lights O
? O
Would O
not O
Lazarus O
rather O
be O
in O
Sumatra O
than O
here O
? O
Would O
he O
not O
far O
rather O
lay O
him O
down O
lengthwise O
along O
the O
line O
of O
the O
equator O
; O
yea O
, O
ye O
gods O
! O
go O
down O
to O
the O
fiery O
pit O
itself O
, O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
out O
this O
frost O
? O
Now O
, O
that O
Lazarus O
should O
lie O
stranded O
there O
on O
the O
curbstone O
before O
the O
door O
of O
Dives O
, O
this O
is O
more O
wonderful O
than O
that O
an O
iceberg O
should O
be O
moored O
to O
one O
of O
the O
Moluccas O
. O
Yet O
Dives O
himself O
, O
he O
too O
lives O
like O
a O
Czar O
in O
an O
ice O
palace O
made O
of O
frozen O
sighs O
, O
and O
being O
a O
president O
of O
a O
temperance O
society O
, O
he O
only O
drinks O
the O
tepid O
tears O
of O
orphans O
. O
But O
no O
more O
of O
this O
blubbering O
now O
, O
we O
are O
going O
a-whaling O
, O
and O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
that O
yet O
to O
come O
. O
Let O
us O
scrape O
the O
ice O
from O
our O
frosted O
feet O
, O
and O
see O
what O
sort O
of O
a O
place O
this O
" O
Spouter O
" O
may O
be O
. O
