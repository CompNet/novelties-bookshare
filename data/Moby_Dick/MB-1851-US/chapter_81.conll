The O
predestinated O
day O
arrived O
, O
and O
we O
duly O
met O
the O
ship O
Jungfrau O
, O
Derick O
De O
Deer O
, O
master O
, O
of O
Bremen O
. O
At O
one O
time O
the O
greatest O
whaling O
people O
in O
the O
world O
, O
the O
Dutch O
and O
Germans O
are O
now O
among O
the O
least O
; O
but O
here O
and O
there O
at O
very O
wide O
intervals O
of O
latitude O
and O
longitude O
, O
you O
still O
occasionally O
meet O
with O
their O
flag O
in O
the O
Pacific O
. O
For O
some O
reason O
, O
the O
Jungfrau O
seemed O
quite O
eager O
to O
pay O
her O
respects O
. O
While O
yet O
some O
distance O
from O
the O
Pequod O
, O
she O
rounded O
to O
, O
and O
dropping O
a O
boat O
, O
her O
captain O
was O
impelled O
towards O
us O
, O
impatiently O
standing O
in O
the O
bows O
instead O
of O
the O
stern O
. O
" O
What O
has O
he O
in O
his O
hand O
there O
? O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
, O
pointing O
to O
something O
wavingly O
held O
by O
the O
German O
. O
" O
Impossible O
! O
—a O
lamp-feeder O
! O
" O
" O
Not O
that O
, O
" O
said O
Stubb O
, O
" O
no O
, O
no O
, O
it O
's O
a O
coffee-pot O
, O
Mr. O
Starbuck O
; O
he O
's O
coming O
on O
to O
make O
us O
our O
coffee O
, O
is O
the O
Yarman O
; O
do O
n't O
you O
see O
that O
big O
tin O
can O
there O
alongside O
of O
him O
? O
—that O
's O
his O
boiling O
water O
. O
Oh O
! O
he O
's O
all O
right O
, O
is O
the O
Yarman O
. O
" O
" O
Go O
along O
with O
you O
, O
" O
cried O
Flask O
, O
" O
it O
's O
a O
lamp-feeder O
and O
an O
oil-can O
. O
He O
's O
out O
of O
oil O
, O
and O
has O
come O
a-begging O
. O
" O
However O
curious O
it O
may O
seem O
for O
an O
oil-ship O
to O
be O
borrowing O
oil O
on O
the O
whale-ground O
, O
and O
however O
much O
it O
may O
invertedly O
contradict O
the O
old O
proverb O
about O
carrying O
coals O
to O
Newcastle O
, O
yet O
sometimes O
such O
a O
thing O
really O
happens O
; O
and O
in O
the O
present O
case O
Captain O
Derick O
De O
Deer O
did O
indubitably O
conduct O
a O
lamp-feeder O
as O
Flask O
did O
declare O
. O
As O
he O
mounted O
the O
deck O
, O
Ahab O
abruptly O
accosted O
him O
, O
without O
at O
all O
heeding O
what O
he O
had O
in O
his O
hand O
; O
but O
in O
his O
broken O
lingo O
, O
the O
German O
soon O
evinced O
his O
complete O
ignorance O
of O
the O
White O
Whale O
; O
immediately O
turning O
the O
conversation O
to O
his O
lamp-feeder O
and O
oil O
can O
, O
with O
some O
remarks O
touching O
his O
having O
to O
turn O
into O
his O
hammock O
at O
night O
in O
profound O
darkness—his O
last O
drop O
of O
Bremen O
oil O
being O
gone O
, O
and O
not O
a O
single O
flying-fish O
yet O
captured O
to O
supply O
the O
deficiency O
; O
concluding O
by O
hinting O
that O
his O
ship O
was O
indeed O
what O
in O
the O
Fishery O
is O
technically O
called O
a O
clean O
one O
( O
that O
is O
, O
an O
empty O
one O
) O
, O
well O
deserving O
the O
name O
of O
Jungfrau O
or O
the O
Virgin O
. O
His O
necessities O
supplied O
, O
Derick O
departed O
; O
but O
he O
had O
not O
gained O
his O
ship O
's O
side O
, O
when O
whales O
were O
almost O
simultaneously O
raised O
from O
the O
mast-heads O
of O
both O
vessels O
; O
and O
so O
eager O
for O
the O
chase O
was O
Derick O
, O
that O
without O
pausing O
to O
put O
his O
oil-can O
and O
lamp-feeder O
aboard O
, O
he O
slewed O
round O
his O
boat O
and O
made O
after O
the O
leviathan O
lamp-feeders O
. O
Now O
, O
the O
game O
having O
risen O
to O
leeward O
, O
he O
and O
the O
other O
three O
German O
boats O
that O
soon O
followed O
him O
, O
had O
considerably O
the O
start O
of O
the O
Pequod O
's O
keels O
. O
There O
were O
eight O
whales O
, O
an O
average O
pod O
. O
Aware O
of O
their O
danger O
, O
they O
were O
going O
all O
abreast O
with O
great O
speed O
straight O
before O
the O
wind O
, O
rubbing O
their O
flanks O
as O
closely O
as O
so O
many O
spans O
of O
horses O
in O
harness O
. O
They O
left O
a O
great O
, O
wide O
wake O
, O
as O
though O
continually O
unrolling O
a O
great O
wide O
parchment O
upon O
the O
sea O
. O
Full O
in O
this O
rapid O
wake O
, O
and O
many O
fathoms O
in O
the O
rear O
, O
swam O
a O
huge O
, O
humped O
old O
bull O
, O
which O
by O
his O
comparatively O
slow O
progress O
, O
as O
well O
as O
by O
the O
unusual O
yellowish O
incrustations O
overgrowing O
him O
, O
seemed O
afflicted O
with O
the O
jaundice O
, O
or O
some O
other O
infirmity O
. O
Whether O
this O
whale O
belonged O
to O
the O
pod O
in O
advance O
, O
seemed O
questionable O
; O
for O
it O
is O
not O
customary O
for O
such O
venerable O
leviathans O
to O
be O
at O
all O
social O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
he O
stuck O
to O
their O
wake O
, O
though O
indeed O
their O
back O
water O
must O
have O
retarded O
him O
, O
because O
the O
white-bone O
or O
swell O
at O
his O
broad O
muzzle O
was O
a O
dashed O
one O
, O
like O
the O
swell O
formed O
when O
two O
hostile O
currents O
meet O
. O
His O
spout O
was O
short O
, O
slow O
, O
and O
laborious O
; O
coining O
forth O
with O
a O
choking O
sort O
of O
gush O
, O
and O
spending O
itself O
in O
torn O
shreds O
, O
followed O
by O
strange O
subterranean O
commotions O
in O
him O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
egress O
at O
his O
other O
buried O
extremity O
, O
causing O
the O
waters O
behind O
him O
to O
upbubble O
. O
" O
Who O
's O
got O
some O
paregoric O
? O
" O
said O
Stubb O
, O
" O
he O
has O
the O
stomach-ache O
, O
I O
'm O
afraid O
. O
Lord O
, O
think O
of O
having O
half O
an O
acre O
of O
stomach-ache O
! O
Adverse O
winds O
are O
holding O
mad O
Christmas O
in O
him O
, O
boys O
. O
It O
's O
the O
first O
foul O
wind O
I O
ever O
knew O
to O
blow O
from O
astern O
; O
but O
look O
, O
did O
ever O
whale O
yaw O
so O
before O
? O
it O
must O
be O
, O
he O
's O
lost O
his O
tiller O
. O
" O
As O
an O
overladen O
Indiaman O
bearing O
down O
the O
Hindostan O
coast O
with O
a O
deck O
load O
of O
frightened O
horses O
, O
careens O
, O
buries O
, O
rolls O
, O
and O
wallows O
on O
her O
way O
; O
so O
did O
this O
old O
whale O
heave O
his O
aged O
bulk O
, O
and O
now O
and O
then O
partly O
turning O
over O
on O
his O
cumbrous O
rib-ends O
, O
expose O
the O
cause O
of O
his O
devious O
wake O
in O
the O
unnatural O
stump O
of O
his O
starboard O
fin O
. O
Whether O
he O
had O
lost O
that O
fin O
in O
battle O
, O
or O
had O
been O
born O
without O
it O
, O
it O
were O
hard O
to O
say O
. O
" O
Only O
wait O
a O
bit O
, O
old O
chap O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
give O
ye O
a O
sling O
for O
that O
wounded O
arm O
, O
" O
cried O
cruel O
Flask O
, O
pointing O
to O
the O
whale-line O
near O
him O
. O
" O
Mind O
he O
do O
n't O
sling O
thee O
with O
it O
, O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
. O
" O
Give O
way O
, O
or O
the O
German O
will O
have O
him O
. O
" O
With O
one O
intent O
all O
the O
combined O
rival O
boats O
were O
pointed O
for O
this O
one O
fish O
, O
because O
not O
only O
was O
he O
the O
largest O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
most O
valuable O
whale O
, O
but O
he O
was O
nearest O
to O
them O
, O
and O
the O
other O
whales O
were O
going O
with O
such O
great O
velocity O
, O
moreover O
, O
as O
almost O
to O
defy O
pursuit O
for O
the O
time O
. O
At O
this O
juncture O
, O
the O
Pequod O
's O
keels O
had O
shot O
by O
the O
three O
German O
boats O
last O
lowered O
; O
but O
from O
the O
great O
start O
he O
had O
had O
, O
Derick O
's O
boat O
still O
led O
the O
chase O
, O
though O
every O
moment O
neared O
by O
his O
foreign O
rivals O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
they O
feared O
, O
was O
, O
that O
from O
being O
already O
so O
nigh O
to O
his O
mark O
, O
he O
would O
be O
enabled O
to O
dart O
his O
iron O
before O
they O
could O
completely O
overtake O
and O
pass O
him O
. O
As O
for O
Derick O
, O
he O
seemed O
quite O
confident O
that O
this O
would O
be O
the O
case O
, O
and O
occasionally O
with O
a O
deriding O
gesture O
shook O
his O
lamp-feeder O
at O
the O
other O
boats O
. O
" O
The O
ungracious O
and O
ungrateful O
dog O
! O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
; O
" O
he O
mocks O
and O
dares O
me O
with O
the O
very O
poor-box O
I O
filled O
for O
him O
not O
five O
minutes O
ago O
! O
" O
—then O
in O
his O
old O
intense O
whisper— O
" O
give O
way O
, O
greyhounds O
! O
Dog O
to O
it O
! O
" O
" O
I O
tell O
ye O
what O
it O
is O
, O
men O
" O
—cried O
Stubb O
to O
his O
crew— O
" O
It O
's O
against O
my O
religion O
to O
get O
mad O
; O
but O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
eat O
that O
villanous O
Yarman—Pull—wont O
ye O
? O
Are O
ye O
going O
to O
let O
that O
rascal O
beat O
ye O
? O
Do O
ye O
love O
brandy O
? O
A O
hogshead O
of O
brandy O
, O
then O
, O
to O
the O
best O
man O
. O
Come O
, O
why O
do O
n't O
some O
of O
ye O
burst O
a O
bloodvessel O
? O
Who O
's O
that O
been O
dropping O
an O
anchor O
overboard—we O
do O
n't O
budge O
an O
inch—we O
're O
becalmed O
. O
Halloo O
, O
here O
's O
grass O
growing O
in O
the O
boat O
's O
bottom—and O
by O
the O
Lord O
, O
the O
mast O
there O
's O
budding O
. O
This O
wo O

Look O
at O
that O
Yarman O
! O
The O
short O
and O
long O
of O

spit O
fire O

not O

" O
" O
Oh O
! O
see O
the O
suds O
he O
makes O
! O
" O
cried O
Flask O
, O
dancing O
up O
and O
down— O
" O
What O
a O
hump—Oh O
, O

pile O
on O
the O
beef—lays O

—What O
's O
that O
Yarman O
about O
now O

" O
At O
this O
moment O
Derick O
was O
in O
the O
act O
of O
pitching O
his O
lamp-feeder O
at O
the O
advancing O
boats O
, O
and O
also O
his O
oil-can O
; O
perhaps O
with O
the O
double O
view O
of O
retarding O
his O
rivals O
' O
way O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
economically O
accelerating O
his O
own O
by O
the O
momentary O
impetus O
of O
the O
backward O
toss O
. O
" O
The O
unmannerly O
Dutch O
dogger O
! O
" O
cried O
Stubb O
. O
" O
Pull O
now O

fifty O
thousand O

red-haired O

, O
Tashtego O

are O
you O
the O
man O
to O
snap O
your O
spine O
in O
two-and-twenty O
pieces O
for O
the O
honor O
of O
old O
Gay-head O
? O
What O

'ye O
say O
? O
" O
" O
I O
say O
, O

like O
god-dam O
, O
" O
—cried O
the O
Indian O
. O
Fiercely O
, O
but O
evenly O
incited O
by O
the O
taunts O
of O
the O
German O
, O
the O
Pequod O
's O
three O
boats O
now O
began O
ranging O
almost O
abreast O
; O
and O
, O
so O
disposed O
, O
momentarily O
neared O
him O
. O
In O
that O
fine O
, O
loose O
, O
chivalrous O
attitude O
of O
the O
headsman O
when O
drawing O
near O
to O
his O
prey O
, O
the O
three O
mates O
stood O
up O
proudly O
, O
occasionally O
backing O
the O
after O
oarsman O
with O
an O
exhilarating O
cry O
of O
, O
" O
There O
she O
slides O
, O
now O
! O
Hurrah O
for O
the O
white-ash O
breeze O
! O
Down O
with O
the O
Yarman O
! O
Sail O
over O
him O
! O
" O
But O
so O
decided O
an O
original O
start O
had O
Derick O
had O
, O
that O
spite O
of O
all O
their O
gallantry O
, O
he O
would O
have O
proved O
the O
victor O
in O
this O
race O
, O
had O
not O
a O
righteous O
judgment O
descended O
upon O
him O
in O
a O
crab O
which O
caught O
the O
blade O
of O
his O
midship O
oarsman O
. O
While O
this O
clumsy O
lubber O
was O
striving O
to O
free O
his O
white-ash O
, O
and O
while O
, O
in O
consequence O
, O
Derick O
's O
boat O
was O
nigh O
to O
capsizing O
, O
and O
he O
thundering O
away O
at O
his O
men O
in O
a O
mighty O
rage O
; O
—that O
was O
a O
good O
time O
for O
Starbuck O
, O
Stubb O
, O
and O
Flask O
. O
With O
a O
shout O
, O
they O
took O
a O
mortal O
start O
forwards O
, O
and O
slantingly O
ranged O
up O
on O
the O
German O
's O
quarter O
. O
An O
instant O
more O
, O
and O
all O
four O
boats O
were O
diagonically O
in O
the O
whale O
's O
immediate O
wake O
, O
while O
stretching O
from O
them O
, O
on O
both O
sides O
, O
was O
the O
foaming O
swell O
that O
he O
made O
. O
It O
was O
a O
terrific O
, O
most O
pitiable O
, O
and O
maddening O
sight O
. O
The O
whale O
was O
now O
going O
head O
out O
, O
and O
sending O
his O
spout O
' O
before O
him O
in O
a O
continual O
tormented O
jet O
; O
while O
his O
one O
poor O
fin O
beat O
his O
side O
in O
an O
agony O
of O
fright O
. O
Now O
to O
this O
hand O
, O
now O
to O
that O
, O
he O
yawed O
in O
his O
faltering O
flight O
, O
and O
still O
at O
every O
billow O
that O
he O
broke O
, O
he O
spasmodically O
sank O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
or O
sideways O
rolled O
towards O
the O
sky O
his O
one O
beating O
fin O
. O
So O
have O
I O
seen O
a O
bird O
with O
clipped O
wing O
, O
making O
affrighted O
broken O
circles O
in O
the O
air O
, O
vainly O
striving O
to O
escape O
the O
piratical O
hawks O
. O
But O
the O
bird O
has O
a O
voice O
, O
and O
with O
plaintive O
cries O
will O
make O
known O
her O
fear O
; O
but O
the O
fear O
of O
this O
vast O
dumb O
brute O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
was O
chained O
up O
and O
enchanted O
in O
him O
; O
he O
had O
no O
voice O
, O
save O
that O
choking O
respiration O
through O
his O
spiracle O
, O
and O
this O
made O
the O
sight O
of O
him O
unspeakably O
pitiable O
; O
while O
still O
, O
in O
his O
amazing O
bulk O
, O
portcullis O
jaw O
, O
and O
omnipotent O
tail O
, O
there O
was O
enough O
to O
appal O
the O
stoutest O
man O
who O
so O
pitied O
. O
Seeing O
now O
that O
but O
a O
very O
few O
moments O
more O
would O
give O
the O
Pequod O
's O
boats O
the O
advantage O
, O
and O
rather O
than O
be O
thus O
foiled O
of O
his O
game O
, O
Derick O
chose O
to O
hazard O
what O
to O
him O
must O
have O
seemed O
a O
most O
unusually O
long O
dart O
, O
ere O
the O
last O
chance O
would O
for O
ever O
escape O
. O
But O
no O
sooner O
did O
his O
harpooneer O
stand O
up O
for O
the O
stroke O
, O
than O
all O
three O
tigers—Queequeg O
, O
Tashtego O
, O
Daggoo—instinctively O
sprang O
to O
their O
feet O
, O
and O
standing O
in O
a O
diagonal O
row O
, O
simultaneously O
pointed O
their O
barbs O
; O
and O
darted O
over O
the O
head O
of O
the O
German O
harpooneer O
, O
their O
three O
Nantucket O
irons O
entered O
the O
whale O
. O
Blinding O
vapors O
of O
foam O
and O
white-fire O
! O
The O
three O
boats O
, O
in O
the O
first O
fury O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
headlong O
rush O
, O
bumped O
the O
German O
's O
aside O
with O
such O
force O
, O
that O
both O
Derick O
and O
his O
baffled O
harpooneer O
were O
spilled O
out O
, O
and O
sailed O
over O
by O
the O
three O
flying O
keels O
. O
" O
Do O
n't O
be O
afraid O
, O
my O
butter-boxes O
, O
" O
cried O
Stubb O
, O
casting O
a O
passing O
glance O
upon O
them O
as O
he O
shot O
by O
; O
" O
ye O
'll O
be O
picked O
up O
presently—all O
right—I O
saw O
some O
sharks O
astern—St O
. O
Bernard O
's O
dogs O
, O
you O
know—relieve O
distressed O
travellers O
. O
Hurrah O
! O
this O
is O
the O
way O
to O
sail O
now O
. O
Every O
keel O
a O
sun-beam O
! O
Hurrah O
! O
—Here O
we O
go O
like O
three O
tin O
kettles O
at O
the O
tail O
of O
a O
mad O
cougar O
! O
This O
puts O
me O
in O
mind O
of O
fastening O
to O
an O
elephant O
in O
a O
tilbury O
on O
a O
plain—makes O
the O
wheel-spokes O
fly O
, O
boys O
, O
when O
you O
fasten O
to O
him O
that O
way O
; O
and O
there O
's O
danger O
of O
being O
pitched O
out O
too O
, O
when O
you O
strike O
a O
hill O
. O
Hurrah O
! O
this O
is O
the O
way O
a O
fellow O
feels O
when O
he O
's O
going O
to O
Davy O
Jones—all O
a O
rush O
down O
an O
endless O
inclined O
plane O
! O
Hurrah O
! O
this O
whale O
carries O
the O
everlasting O
mail O
! O
" O
But O
the O
monster O
's O
run O
was O
a O
brief O
one O
. O
Giving O
a O
sudden O
gasp O
, O
he O
tumultuously O
sounded O
. O
With O
a O
grating O
rush O
, O
the O
three O
lines O
flew O
round O
the O
loggerheads O
with O
such O
a O
force O
as O
to O
gouge O
deep O
grooves O
in O
them O
; O
while O
so O
fearful O
were O
the O
harpooneers O
that O
this O
rapid O
sounding O
would O
soon O
exhaust O
the O
lines O
, O
that O
using O
all O
their O
dexterous O
might O
, O
they O
caught O
repeated O
smoking O
turns O
with O
the O
rope O
to O
hold O
on O
; O
till O
at O
last—owing O
to O
the O
perpendicular O
strain O
from O
the O
lead-lined O
chocks O
of O
the O
boats O
, O
whence O
the O
three O
ropes O
went O
straight O
down O
into O
the O
blue—the O
gunwales O
of O
the O
bows O
were O
almost O
even O
with O
the O
water O
, O
while O
the O
three O
stems O
tilted O
high O
in O
the O
air O
. O
And O
the O
whale O
soon O
ceasing O
to O
sound O
, O
for O
some O
time O
they O
remained O
in O
that O
attitude O
, O
fearful O
of O
expending O
more O
line O
, O
though O
the O
position O
was O
a O
little O
ticklish O
. O
But O
though O
boats O
have O
been O
taken O
down O
and O
lost O
in O
this O
way O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
this O
" O
holding O
on O
, O
" O
as O
it O
is O
called O
; O
this O
hooking O
up O
by O
the O
sharp O
barbs O
of O
his O
live O
flesh O
from O
the O
back O
; O
this O
it O
is O
that O
often O
torments O
the O
Leviathan O
into O
soon O
rising O
again O
to O
meet O
the O
sharp O
lance O
of O
his O
foes O
. O
Yet O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
the O
peril O
of O
the O
thing O
, O
it O
is O
to O
be O
doubted O
whether O
this O
course O
is O
always O
the O
best O
; O
for O
it O
is O
but O
reasonable O
to O
presume O
, O
that O
the O
longer O
the O
stricken O
whale O
stays O
under O
water O
, O
the O
more O
he O
is O
exhausted O
. O
Because O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
enormous O
surface O
of O
him—in O
a O
full O
grown O
sperm O
whale O
something O
less O
than O
2000 O
square O
feet—the O
pressure O
of O
the O
water O
is O
immense O
. O
We O
all O
know O
what O
an O
astonishing O
atmospheric O
weight O
we O
ourselves O
stand O
up O
under O
; O
even O
here O
, O
above-ground O
, O
in O
the O
air O
; O
how O
vast O
, O
then O
, O
the O
burden O
of O
a O
whale O
, O
bearing O
on O
his O
back O
a O
column O
of O
two O
hundred O
fathoms O
of O
ocean O
! O
It O
must O
at O
least O
equal O
the O
weight O
of O
fifty O
atmospheres O
. O
One O
whaleman O
has O
estimated O
it O
at O
the O
weight O
of O
twenty O
line-of O
battle O
ships O
, O
with O
all O
their O
guns O
, O
and O
stores O
, O
and O
men O
on O
board O
. O
As O
the O
three O
boats O
lay O
there O
on O
that O
gently O
rolling O
sea O
, O
gazing O
down O
into O
its O
eternal O
blue O
noon O
; O
and O
as O
not O
a O
single O
groan O
or O
cry O
of O
any O
sort O
, O
nay O
, O
not O
so O
much O
as O
a O
ripple O
or O
a O
bubble O
came O
up O
from O
its O
depths O
; O
what O
landsman O
would O
have O
thought O
, O
that O
beneath O
all O
that O
silence O
and O
placidity O
, O
the O
utmost O
monster O
of O
the O
seas O
was O
writhing O
and O
wrenching O
in O
agony O
! O
Not O
eight O
inches O
of O
perpendicular O
rope O
were O
visible O
at O
the O
bows O
. O
Seems O
it O
credible O
that O
by O
three O
such O
thin O
threads O
the O
great O
Leviathan O
was O
suspended O
like O
the O
big O
weight O
to O
an O
eight O
day O
clock O
. O
Suspended O
? O
and O
to O
what O
? O
To O
three O
bits O
of O
board O
. O
Is O
this O
the O
creature O
of O
whom O
it O
was O
once O
so O
triumphantly O
said— O
" O
Canst O
thou O
fill O
his O
skin O
with O
barbed O
irons O
? O
or O
his O
head O
with O
fish-spears O
? O
The O
sword O
of O
him O
that O
layeth O
at O
him O
can O
not O
hold O
, O
the O
spear O
, O
the O
dart O
, O
nor O
the O
habergeon O
: O
he O
esteemeth O
iron O
as O
straw O
; O
the O
arrow O
can O
not O
make O
him O
flee O
; O
darts O
are O
counted O
as O
stubble O
; O
he O
laugheth O
at O
the O
shaking O
of O
a O
spear O
! O
" O
This O
the O
creature O
? O
this O
he O
? O
Oh O
! O
that O
unfulfilments O
should O
follow O
the O
prophets O
. O
For O
with O
the O
strength O
of O
a O
thousand O
thighs O
in O
his O
tail O
, O
Leviathan O
had O
run O
his O
head O
under O
the O
mountains O
of O
the O
sea O
, O
to O
hide O
him O
from O
the O
Pequod O
's O
fish-spears O
! O
In O
that O
sloping O
afternoon O
sunlight O
, O
the O
shadows O
that O
the O
three O
boats O
sent O
down O
beneath O
the O
surface O
, O
must O
have O
been O
long O
enough O
and O
broad O
enough O
to O
shade O
half O
Xerxes O
' O
army O
. O
Who O
can O
tell O
how O
appalling O
to O
the O
wounded O
whale O
must O
have O
been O
such O
huge O
phantoms O
flitting O
over O
his O
head O
! O
" O
Stand O
by O
, O
men O
; O
he O
stirs O
, O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
, O
as O
the O
three O
lines O
suddenly O
vibrated O
in O
the O
water O
, O
distinctly O
conducting O
upwards O
to O
them O
, O
as O
by O
magnetic O
wires O
, O
the O
life O
and O
death O
throbs O
of O
the O
whale O
, O
so O
that O
every O
oarsman O
felt O
them O
in O
his O
seat O
. O
The O
next O
moment O
, O
relieved O
in O
great O
part O
from O
the O
downward O
strain O
at O
the O
bows O
, O
the O
boats O
gave O
a O
sudden O
bounce O
upwards O
, O
as O
a O
small O
ice-field O
will O
, O
when O
a O
dense O
herd O
of O
white O
bears O
are O
scared O
from O
it O
into O
the O
sea O
. O
" O
Haul O
in O
! O
Haul O
in O
! O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
again O
; O
" O
he O
's O
rising O
. O
" O
The O
lines O
, O
of O
which O
, O
hardly O
an O
instant O
before O
, O
not O
one O
hand O
's O
breadth O
could O
have O
been O
gained O
, O
were O
now O
in O
long O
quick O
coils O
flung O
back O
all O
dripping O
into O
the O
boats O
, O
and O
soon O
the O
whale O
broke O
water O
within O
two O
ship O
's O
lengths O
of O
the O
hunters O
. O
His O
motions O
plainly O
denoted O
his O
extreme O
exhaustion O
. O
In O
most O
land O
animals O
there O
are O
certain O
valves O
or O
flood-gates O
in O
many O
of O
their O
veins O
, O
whereby O
when O
wounded O
, O
the O
blood O
is O
in O
some O
degree O
at O
least O
instantly O
shut O
off O
in O
certain O
directions O
. O
Not O
so O
with O
the O
whale O
; O
one O
of O
whose O
peculiarities O
it O
is O
, O
to O
have O
an O
entire O
non-valvular O
structure O
of O
the O
blood-vessels O
, O
so O
that O
when O
pierced O
even O
by O
so O
small O
a O
point O
as O
a O
harpoon O
, O
a O
deadly O
drain O
is O
at O
once O
begun O
upon O
his O
whole O
arterial O
system O
; O
and O
when O
this O
is O
heightened O
by O
the O
extraordinary O
pressure O
of O
water O
at O
a O
great O
distance O
below O
the O
surface O
, O
his O
life O
may O
be O
said O
to O
pour O
from O
him O
in O
incessant O
streams O
. O
Yet O
so O
vast O
is O
the O
quantity O
of O
blood O
in O
him O
, O
and O
so O
distant O
and O
numerous O
its O
interior O
fountains O
, O
that O
he O
will O
keep O
thus O
bleeding O
and O
bleeding O
for O
a O
considerable O
period O
; O
even O
as O
in O
a O
drought O
a O
river O
will O
flow O
, O
whose O
source O
is O
in O
the O
well-springs O
of O
far-off O
and O
undiscernible O
hills O
. O
Even O
now O
, O
when O
the O
boats O
pulled O
upon O
this O
whale O
, O
and O
perilously O
drew O
over O
his O
swaying O
flukes O
, O
and O
the O
lances O
were O
darted O
into O
him O
, O
they O
were O
followed O
by O
steady O
jets O
from O
the O
new O
made O
wound O
, O
which O
kept O
continually O
playing O
, O
while O
the O
natural O
spout-hole O
in O
his O
head O
was O
only O
at O
intervals O
, O
however O
rapid O
, O
sending O
its O
affrighted O
moisture O
into O
the O
air O
. O
From O
this O
last O
vent O
no O
blood O
yet O
came O
, O
because O
no O
vital O
part O
of O
him O
had O
thus O
far O
been O
struck O
. O
His O
life O
, O
as O
they O
significantly O
call O
it O
, O
was O
untouched O
. O
As O
the O
boats O
now O
more O
closely O
surrounded O
him O
, O
the O
whole O
upper O
part O
of O
his O
form O
, O
with O
much O
of O
it O
that O
is O
ordinarily O
submerged O
, O
was O
plainly O
revealed O
. O
His O
eyes O
, O
or O
rather O
the O
places O
where O
his O
eyes O
had O
been O
, O
were O
beheld O
. O
As O
strange O
misgrown O
masses O
gather O
in O
the O
knot-holes O
of O
the O
noblest O
oaks O
when O
prostrate O
, O
so O
from O
the O
points O
which O
the O
whale O
's O
eyes O
had O
once O
occupied O
, O
now O
protruded O
blind O
bulbs O
, O
horribly O
pitiable O
to O
see O
. O
But O
pity O
there O
was O
none O
. O
For O
all O
his O
old O
age O
, O
and O
his O
one O
arm O
, O
and O
his O
blind O
eyes O
, O
he O
must O
die O
the O
death O
and O
be O
murdered O
, O
in O
order O
to O
light O
the O
gay O
bridals O
and O
other O
merry-makings O
of O
men O
, O
and O
also O
to O
illuminate O
the O
solemn O
churches O
that O
preach O
unconditional O
inoffensiveness O
by O
all O
to O
all O
. O
Still O
rolling O
in O
his O
blood O
, O
at O
last O
he O
partially O
disclosed O
a O
strangely O
discolored O
bunch O
or O
protuberance O
, O
the O
size O
of O
a O
bushel O
, O
low O
down O
on O
the O
flank O
. O
" O
A O
nice O
spot O
, O
" O
cried O
Flask O
; O
" O
just O
let O
me O
prick O
him O
there O
once O
. O
" O
" O
Avast O
! O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
, O
" O
there O
's O
no O
need O
of O
that O
! O
" O
But O
humane O
Starbuck O
was O
too O
late O
. O
At O
the O
instant O
of O
the O
dart O
an O
ulcerous O
jet O
shot O
from O
this O
cruel O
wound O
, O
and O
goaded O
by O
it O
into O
more O
than O
sufferable O
anguish O
, O
the O
whale O
now O
spouting O
thick O
blood O
, O
with O
swift O
fury O
blindly O
darted O
at O
the O
craft O
, O
bespattering O
them O
and O
their O
glorying O
crews O
all O
over O
with O
showers O
of O
gore O
, O
capsizing O
Flask O
's O
boat O
and O
marring O
the O
bows O
. O
It O
was O
his O
death O
stroke O
. O
For O
, O
by O
this O
time O
, O
so O
spent O
was O
he O
by O
loss O
of O
blood O
, O
that O
he O
helplessly O
rolled O
away O
from O
the O
wreck O
he O
had O
made O
; O
lay O
panting O
on O
his O
side O
, O
impotently O
flapped O
with O
his O
stumped O
fin O
, O
then O
over O
and O
over O
slowly O
revolved O
like O
a O
waning O
world O
; O
turned O
up O
the O
white O
secrets O
of O
his O
belly O
; O
lay O
like O
a O
log O
, O
and O
died O
. O
It O
was O
most O
piteous O
, O
that O
last O
expiring O
spout O
. O
As O
when O
by O
unseen O
hands O
the O
water O
is O
gradually O
drawn O
off O
from O
some O
mighty O
fountain O
, O
and O
with O
half-stifled O
melancholy O
gurglings O
the O
spray-column O
lowers O
and O
lowers O
to O
the O
ground—so O
the O
last O
long O
dying O
spout O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
Soon O
, O
while O
the O
crews O
were O
awaiting O
the O
arrival O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
the O
body O
showed O
symptoms O
of O
sinking O
with O
all O
its O
treasures O
unrifled O
. O
Immediately O
, O
by O
Starbuck O
's O
orders O
, O
lines O
were O
secured O
to O
it O
at O
different O
points O
, O
so O
that O
ere O
long O
every O
boat O
was O
a O
buoy O
; O
the O
sunken O
whale O
being O
suspended O
a O
few O
inches O
beneath O
them O
by O
the O
cords O
. O
By O
very O
heedful O
management O
, O
when O
the O
ship O
drew O
nigh O
, O
the O
whale O
was O
transferred O
to O
her O
side O
, O
and O
was O
strongly O
secured O
there O
by O
the O
stiffest O
fluke-chains O
, O
for O
it O
was O
plain O
that O
unless O
artificially O
upheld O
, O
the O
body O
would O
at O
once O
sink O
to O
the O
bottom O
. O
It O
so O
chanced O
that O
almost O
upon O
first O
cutting O
into O
him O
with O
the O
spade O
, O
the O
entire O
length O
of O
a O
corroded O
harpoon O
was O
found O
imbedded O
in O
his O
flesh O
, O
on O
the O
lower O
part O
of O
the O
bunch O
before O
described O
. O
But O
as O
the O
stumps O
of O
harpoons O
are O
frequently O
found O
in O
the O
dead O
bodies O
of O
captured O
whales O
, O
with O
the O
flesh O
perfectly O
healed O
around O
them O
, O
and O
no O
prominence O
of O
any O
kind O
to O
denote O
their O
place O
; O
therefore O
, O
there O
must O
needs O
have O
been O
some O
other O
unknown O
reason O
in O
the O
present O
case O
fully O
to O
account O
for O
the O
ulceration O
alluded O
to O
. O
But O
still O
more O
curious O
was O
the O
fact O
of O
a O
lance-head O
of O
stone O
being O
found O
in O
him O
, O
not O
far O
from O
the O
buried O
iron O
, O
the O
flesh O
perfectly O
firm O
about O
it O
. O
Who O
had O
darted O
that O
stone O
lance O
? O
And O
when O
? O
It O
might O
have O
been O
darted O
by O
some O
Nor O
' O
West O
Indian O
long O
before O
America O
was O
discovered O
. O
What O
other O
marvels O
might O
have O
been O
rummaged O
out O
of O
this O
monstrous O
cabinet O
there O
is O
no O
telling O
. O
But O
a O
sudden O
stop O
was O
put O
to O
further O
discoveries O
, O
by O
the O
ship O
's O
being O
unprecedentedly O
dragged O
over O
sideways O
to O
the O
sea O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
body O
's O
immensely O
increasing O
tendency O
to O
sink O
. O
However O
, O
Starbuck O
, O
who O
had O
the O
ordering O
of O
affairs O
, O
hung O
on O
to O
it O
to O
the O
last O
; O
hung O
on O
to O
it O
so O
resolutely O
, O
indeed O
, O
that O
when O
at O
length O
the O
ship O
would O
have O
been O
capsized O
, O
if O
still O
persisting O
in O
locking O
arms O
with O
the O
body O
; O
then O
, O
when O
the O
command O
was O
given O
to O
break O
clear O
from O
it O
, O
such O
was O
the O
immovable O
strain O
upon O
the O
timber-heads O
to O
which O
the O
fluke-chains O
and O
cables O
were O
fastened O
, O
that O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
cast O
them O
off O
. O
Meantime O
everything O
in O
the O
Pequod O
was O
aslant O
. O
To O
cross O
to O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
deck O
was O
like O
walking O
up O
the O
steep O
gabled O
roof O
of O
a O
house O
. O
The O
ship O
groaned O
and O
gasped O
. O
Many O
of O
the O
ivory O
inlayings O
of O
her O
bulwarks O
and O
cabins O
were O
started O
from O
their O
places O
, O
by O
the O
unnatural O
dislocation O
. O
In O
vain O
handspikes O
and O
crows O
were O
brought O
to O
bear O
upon O
the O
immovable O
fluke-chains O
, O
to O
pry O
them O
adrift O
from O
the O
timber-heads O
; O
and O
so O
low O
had O
the O
whale O
now O
settled O
that O
the O
submerged O
ends O
could O
not O
be O
at O
all O
approached O
, O
while O
every O
moment O
whole O
tons O
of O
ponderosity O
seemed O
added O
to O
the O
sinking O
bulk O
, O
and O
the O
ship O
seemed O
on O
the O
point O
of O
going O
over O
. O
" O
Hold O
on O
, O
hold O
on O
, O
wo O
n't O
ye O
? O
" O
cried O
Stubb O
to O
the O
body O
, O
" O
do O
n't O
be O
in O
such O
a O
devil O
of O
a O
hurry O
to O
sink O
! O
By O
thunder O
, O
men O
, O
we O
must O
do O
something O
or O
go O
for O
it O
. O
No O
use O
prying O
there O
; O
avast O
, O
I O
say O
with O
your O
handspikes O
, O
and O
run O
one O
of O
ye O
for O
a O
prayer O
book O
and O
a O
pen-knife O
, O
and O
cut O
the O
big O
chains O
. O
" O
" O
Knife O
? O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
" O
cried O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
seizing O
the O
carpenter O
's O
heavy O
hatchet O
, O
he O
leaned O
out O
of O
a O
porthole O
, O
and O
steel O
to O
iron O
, O
began O
slashing O
at O
the O
largest O
fluke-chains O
. O
But O
a O
few O
strokes O
, O
full O
of O
sparks O
, O
were O
given O
, O
when O
the O
exceeding O
strain O
effected O
the O
rest O
. O
With O
a O
terrific O
snap O
, O
every O
fastening O
went O
adrift O
; O
the O
ship O
righted O
, O
the O
carcase O
sank O
. O
Now O
, O
this O
occasional O
inevitable O
sinking O
of O
the O
recently O
killed O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
a O
very O
curious O
thing O
; O
nor O
has O
any O
fisherman O
yet O
adequately O
accounted O
for O
it O
. O
Usually O
the O
dead O
Sperm O
Whale O
floats O
with O
great O
buoyancy O
, O
with O
its O
side O
or O
belly O
considerably O
elevated O
above O
the O
surface O
. O
If O
the O
only O
whales O
that O
thus O
sank O
were O
old O
, O
meagre O
, O
and O
broken-hearted O
creatures O
, O
their O
pads O
of O
lard O
diminished O
and O
all O
their O
bones O
heavy O
and O
rheumatic O
; O
then O
you O
might O
with O
some O
reason O
assert O
that O
this O
sinking O
is O
caused O
by O
an O
uncommon O
specific O
gravity O
in O
the O
fish O
so O
sinking O
, O
consequent O
upon O
this O
absence O
of O
buoyant O
matter O
in O
him O
. O
But O
it O
is O
not O
so O
. O
For O
young O
whales O
, O
in O
the O
highest O
health O
, O
and O
swelling O
with O
noble O
aspirations O
, O
prematurely O
cut O
off O
in O
the O
warm O
flush O
and O
May O
of O
life O
, O
with O
all O
their O
panting O
lard O
about O
them O
; O
even O
these O
brawny O
, O
buoyant O
heroes O
do O
sometimes O
sink O
. O
Be O
it O
said O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
far O
less O
liable O
to O
this O
accident O
than O
any O
other O
species O
. O
Where O
one O
of O
that O
sort O
go O
down O
, O
twenty O
Right O
Whales O
do O
. O
This O
difference O
in O
the O
species O
is O
no O
doubt O
imputable O
in O
no O
small O
degree O
to O
the O
greater O
quantity O
of O
bone O
in O
the O
Right O
Whale O
; O
his O
Venetian O
blinds O
alone O
sometimes O
weighing O
more O
than O
a O
ton O
; O
from O
this O
incumbrance O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
wholly O
free O
. O
But O
there O
are O
instances O
where O
, O
after O
the O
lapse O
of O
many O
hours O
or O
several O
days O
, O
the O
sunken O
whale O
again O
rises O
, O
more O
buoyant O
than O
in O
life O
. O
But O
the O
reason O
of O
this O
is O
obvious O
. O
Gases O
are O
generated O
in O
him O
; O
he O
swells O
to O
a O
prodigious O
magnitude O
; O
becomes O
a O
sort O
of O
animal O
balloon O
. O
A O
line-of-battle O
ship O
could O
hardly O
keep O
him O
under O
then O
. O
In O
the O
Shore O
Whaling O
, O
on O
soundings O
, O
among O
the O
Bays O
of O
New O
Zealand O
, O
when O
a O
Right O
Whale O
gives O
token O
of O
sinking O
, O
they O
fasten O
buoys O
to O
him O
, O
with O
plenty O
of O
rope O
; O
so O
that O
when O
the O
body O
has O
gone O
down O
, O
they O
know O
where O
to O
look O
for O
it O
when O
it O
shall O
have O
ascended O
again O
. O
It O
was O
not O
long O
after O
the O
sinking O
of O
the O
body O
that O
a O
cry O
was O
heard O
from O
the O
Pequod O
's O
mast-heads O
, O
announcing O
that O
the O
Jungfrau O
was O
again O
lowering O
her O
boats O
; O
though O
the O
only O
spout O
in O
sight O
was O
that O
of O
a O
Fin-Back O
, O
belonging O
to O
the O
species O
of O
uncapturable O
whales O
, O
because O
of O
its O
incredible O
power O
of O
swimming O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
the O
Fin-Back O
's O
spout O
is O
so O
similar O
to O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
, O
that O
by O
unskilful O
fishermen O
it O
is O
often O
mistaken O
for O
it O
. O
And O
consequently O
Derick O
and O
all O
his O
host O
were O
now O
in O
valiant O
chase O
of O
this O
unnearable O
brute O
. O
The O
Virgin O
crowding O
all O
sail O
, O
made O
after O
her O
four O
young O
keels O
, O
and O
thus O
they O
all O
disappeared O
far O
to O
leeward O
, O
still O
in O
bold O
, O
hopeful O
chase O
. O
Oh O
! O
many O
are O
the O
Fin-Backs O
, O
and O
many O
are O
the O
Dericks O
, O
my O
friend O
. O
