SCAN O
THE O
LINES O
of O
his O
face O
, O
or O
feel O
the O
bumps O
on O
the O
head O
of O
this O
Leviathan O
; O
this O
is O
a O
thing O
which O
no O
Physiognomist O
or O
Phrenologist O
has O
as O
yet O
undertaken O
. O
Such O
an O
enterprise O
would O
seem O
almost O
as O
hopeful O
as O
for O
Lavater O
to O
have O
scrutinized O
the O
wrinkles O
on O
the O
Rock O
of O
Gibraltar O
, O
or O
for O
Gall O
to O
have O
mounted O
a O
ladder O
and O
manipulated O
the O
Dome O
of O
the O
Pantheon O
. O
Still O
, O
in O
that O
famous O
work O
of O
his O
, O
Lavater O
not O
only O
treats O
of O
the O
various O
faces O
of O
men O
, O
but O
also O
attentively O
studies O
the O
faces O
of O
horses O
, O
birds O
, O
serpents O
, O
and O
fish O
; O
and O
dwells O
in O
detail O
upon O
the O
modifications O
of O
expression O
discernible O
therein O
. O
Nor O
have O
Gall O
and O
his O
disciple O
Spurzheim O
failed O
to O
throw O
out O
some O
hints O
touching O
the O
phrenological O
characteristics O
of O
other O
beings O
than O
man O
. O
Therefore O
, O
though O
I O
am O
but O
ill O
qualified O
for O
a O
pioneer O
, O
in O
the O
application O
of O
these O
two O
semi-sciences O
to O
the O
whale O
, O
I O
will O
do O
my O
endeavor O
. O
I O
try O
all O
things O
; O
I O
achieve O
what O
I O
can O
. O
Physiognomically O
regarded O
, O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
is O
an O
anomalous O
creature O
. O
He O
has O
no O
proper O
nose O
. O
And O
since O
the O
nose O
is O
the O
central O
and O
most O
conspicuous O
of O
the O
features O
; O
and O
since O
it O
perhaps O
most O
modifies O
and O
finally O
controls O
their O
combined O
expression O
; O
hence O
it O
would O
seem O
that O
its O
entire O
absence O
, O
as O
an O
external O
appendage O
, O
must O
very O
largely O
affect O
the O
countenance O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
For O
as O
in O
landscape O
gardening O
, O
a O
spire O
, O
cupola O
, O
monument O
, O
or O
tower O
of O
some O
sort O
, O
is O
deemed O
almost O
indispensable O
to O
the O
completion O
of O
the O
scene O
; O
so O
no O
face O
can O
be O
physiognomically O
in O
keeping O
without O
the O
elevated O
open-work O
belfry O
of O
the O
nose O
. O
Dash O
the O
nose O
from O
Phidias O
's O
marble O
Jove O
, O
and O
what O
a O
sorry O
remainder O
! O
Nevertheless O
, O
Leviathan O
is O
of O
so O
mighty O
a O
magnitude O
, O
all O
his O
proportions O
are O
so O
stately O
, O
that O
the O
same O
deficiency O
which O
in O
the O
sculptured O
Jove O
were O
hideous O
, O
in O
him O
is O
no O
blemish O
at O
all O
. O
Nay O
, O
it O
is O
an O
added O
grandeur O
. O
A O
nose O
to O
the O
whale O
would O
have O
been O
impertinent O
. O
As O
on O
your O
physiognomical O
voyage O
you O
sail O
round O
his O
vast O
head O
in O
your O
jolly-boat O
, O
your O
noble O
conceptions O
of O
him O
are O
never O
insulted O
by O
the O
reflection O
that O
he O
has O
a O
nose O
to O
be O
pulled O
. O
A O
pestilent O
conceit O
, O
which O
so O
often O
will O
insist O
upon O
obtruding O
even O
when O
beholding O
the O
mightiest O
royal O
beadle O
on O
his O
throne O
. O
In O
some O
particulars O
, O
perhaps O
the O
most O
imposing O
physiognomical O
view O
to O
be O
had O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
is O
that O
of O
the O
full O
front O
of O
his O
head O
. O
This O
aspect O
is O
sublime O
. O
In O
thought O
, O
a O
fine O
human O
brow O
is O
like O
the O
East O
when O
troubled O
with O
the O
morning O
. O
In O
the O
repose O
of O
the O
pasture O
, O
the O
curled O
brow O
of O
the O
bull O
has O
a O
touch O
of O
the O
grand O
in O
it O
. O
Pushing O
heavy O
cannon O
up O
mountain O
defiles O
, O
the O
elephant O
's O
brow O
is O
majestic O
. O
Human O
or O
animal O
, O
the O
mystical O
brow O
is O
as O
that O
great O
golden O
seal O
affixed O
by O
the O
German O
emperors O
to O
their O
decrees O
. O
It O
signifies— O
" O
God O
: O
done O
this O
day O
by O
my O
hand O
. O
" O
But O
in O
most O
creatures O
, O
nay O
in O
man O
himself O
, O
very O
often O
the O
brow O
is O
but O
a O
mere O
strip O
of O
alpine O
land O
lying O
along O
the O
snow O
line O
. O
Few O
are O
the O
foreheads O
which O
like O
Shakspeare O
's O
or O
Melanethon O
's O
rise O
so O
high O
, O
and O
descend O
so O
low O
, O
that O
the O
eyes O
themselves O
seem O
clear O
, O
eternal O
, O
tideless O
mountain O
lakes O
; O
and O
all O
above O
them O
in O
the O
forehead O
's O
wrinkles O
, O
you O
seem O
to O
track O
the O
antlered O
thoughts O
descending O
there O
to O
drink O
, O
as O
the O
Highland O
hunters O
track O
the O
snow O
prints O
of O
the O
deer O
. O
But O
in O
the O
great O
Sperm O
Whale O
, O
this O
high O
and O
mighty O
god-like O
dignity O
inherent O
in O
the O
brow O
is O
so O
immensely O
amplified O
, O
that O
gazing O
on O
it O
, O
in O
that O
full O
front O
view O
, O
you O
feel O
the O
Deity O
and O
the O
dread O
powers O
more O
forcibly O
than O
in O
beholding O
any O
other O
object O
in O
living O
nature O
. O
For O
you O
see O
no O
one O
point O
precisely O
; O
not O
one O
distinct O
feature O
is O
revealed O
; O
no O
nose O
, O
eyes O
, O
ears O
, O
or O
mouth O
; O
no O
face O
; O
he O
has O
none O
, O
proper O
; O
nothing O
but O
that O
one O
broad O
firmament O
of O
a O
forehead O
, O
pleated O
with O
riddles O
; O
dumbly O
lowering O
with O
the O
doom O
of O
boats O
, O
and O
ships O
, O
and O
men O
. O
Nor O
, O
in O
profile O
, O
does O
this O
wondrous O
brow O
diminish O
; O
though O
that O
way O
viewed O
, O
its O
grandeur O
does O
not O
domineer O
upon O
you O
so O
. O
In O
profile O
, O
you O
plainly O
perceive O
that O
horizontal O
, O
semi-crescentic O
depression O
in O
the O
forehead O
's O
middle O
, O
which O
, O
in O
man O
, O
is O
Lavater O
's O
mark O
of O
genius O
. O
But O
how O
? O
Genius O
in O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
? O
Has O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
ever O
written O
a O
book O
, O
spoken O
a O
speech O
? O
No O
, O
his O
great O
genius O
is O
declared O
in O
his O
doing O
nothing O
particular O
to O
prove O
it O
. O
It O
is O
moreover O
declared O
in O
his O
pyramidical O
silence O
. O
And O
this O
reminds O
me O
that O
had O
the O
great O
Sperm O
Whale O
been O
known O
to O
the O
young O
Orient O
World O
, O
he O
would O
have O
been O
deified O
by O
their O
child-magian O
thoughts O
. O
They O
deified O
the O
crocodile O
of O
the O
Nile O
, O
because O
the O
crocodile O
is O
tongueless O
; O
and O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
has O
no O
tongue O
, O
or O
at O
least O
it O
is O
so O
exceedingly O
small O
, O
as O
to O
be O
incapable O
of O
protrusion O
. O
If O
hereafter O
any O
highly O
cultured O
, O
poetical O
nation O
shall O
lure O
back O
to O
their O
birth-right O
, O
the O
merry O
May-day O
gods O
of O
old O
; O
and O
livingly O
enthrone O
them O
again O
in O
the O
now O
egotistical O
sky O
; O
in O
the O
now O
unhaunted O
hill O
; O
then O
be O
sure O
, O
exalted O
to O
Jove O
's O
high O
seat O
, O
the O
great O
Sperm O
Whale O
shall O
lord O
it O
. O
Champollion O
deciphered O
the O
wrinkled O
granite O
hieroglyphics O
. O
But O
there O
is O
no O
Champollion O
to O
decipher O
the O
Egypt O
of O
every O
man O
's O
and O
every O
being O
's O
face O
. O
Physiognomy O
, O
like O
every O
other O
human O
science O
, O
is O
but O
a O
passing O
fable O
. O
If O
then O
, O
Sir O
William O
Jones O
, O
who O
read O
in O
thirty O
languages O
, O
could O
not O
read O
the O
simplest O
peasant O
's O
face O
in O
its O
profounder O
and O
more O
subtle O
meanings O
, O
how O
may O
unlettered O
Ishmael O
hope O
to O
read O
the O
awful O
Chaldee O
of O
the O
Sperm O
Whale O
's O
brow O
? O
I O
but O
put O
that O
brow O
before O
you O
. O
Read O
it O
if O
you O
can O
