THE O
PHANTOMS O
, O
for O
so O
they O
then O
seemed O
, O
were O
flitting O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
, O
with O
a O
noiseless O
celerity O
, O
were O
casting O
loose O
the O
tackles O
and O
bands O
of O
the O
boat O
which O
swung O
there O
. O
This O
boat O
had O
always O
been O
deemed O
one O
of O
the O
spare O
boats O
, O
though O
technically O
called O
the O
captain O
's O
, O
on O
account O
of O
its O
hanging O
from O
the O
starboard O
quarter O
. O
The O
figure O
that O
now O
stood O
by O
its O
bows O
was O
tall O
and O
swart O
, O
with O
one O
white O
tooth O
evilly O
protruding O
from O
its O
steel-like O
lips O
. O
A O
rumpled O
Chinese O
jacket O
of O
black O
cotton O
funerealIy O
invested O
him O
, O
with O
wide O
black O
trowsers O
of O
the O
same O
dark O
stuff O
. O
But O
strangely O
crowning O
this O
ebonness O
was O
a O
glistening O
white O
plaited O
turban O
, O
the O
living O
hair O
braided O
and O
coiled O
round O
and O
round O
upon O
his O
head O
. O
Less O
swart O
in O
aspect O
, O
the O
companions O
of O
this O
figure O
were O
of O
that O
vivid O
, O
tiger-yellow O
complexion O
peculiar O
to O
some O
of O
the O
aboriginal O
natives O
of O
the O
Manillas O
; O
—a O
race O
notorious O
for O
a O
certain O
diabolism O
of O
subtilty O
, O
and O
by O
some O
honest O
white O
mariners O
supposed O
to O
be O
the O
paid O
spies O
and O
secret O
confidential O
agents O
on O
the O
water O
of O
the O
devil O
, O
their O
lord O
, O
whose O
counting-room O
they O
suppose O
to O
be O
elsewhere O
. O
While O
yet O
the O
wondering O
ship O
's O
company O
were O
gazing O
upon O
these O
strangers O
, O
Ahab O
cried O
out O
to O
the O
white-turbaned O
old O
man O
at O
their O
head O
, O
" O
All O
ready O
there O
, O
Fedallah O
? O
" O
" O
Ready O
, O
" O
was O
the O
half-hissed O
reply O
. O
" O
Lower O
away O
then O
; O
d O
'ye O
hear O
? O
" O
shouting O
across O
the O
deck O
. O
" O
Lower O
away O
there O
, O
I O
say O
. O
" O
Such O
was O
the O
thunder O
of O
his O
voice O
, O
that O
spite O
of O
their O
amazement O
the O
men O
sprang O
over O
the O
rail O
; O
the O
sheaves O
whirled O
round O
in O
the O
blocks O
; O
with O
a O
wallow O
, O
the O
three O
boats O
dropped O
into O
the O
sea O
; O
while O
, O
with O
a O
dexterous O
, O
offhanded O
daring O
, O
unknown O
in O
any O
other O
vocation O
, O
the O
sailors O
, O
goat-like O
, O
leaped O
down O
the O
rolling O
ship O
's O
side O
into O
the O
tossed O
boats O
below O
. O
Hardly O
had O
they O
pulled O
out O
from O
under O
the O
ship O
's O
lee O
, O
when O
a O
fourth O
keel O
, O
coming O
from O
the O
windward O
side O
, O
pulled O
round O
under O
the O
stern O
, O
and O
showed O
the O
five O
strangers O
rowing O
Ahab O
, O
who O
, O
standing O
erect O
in O
the O
stern O
, O
loudly O
hailed O
Starbuck O
, O
Stubb O
, O
and O
Flask O
, O
to O
spread O
themselves O
widely O
, O
so O
as O
to O
cover O
a O
large O
expanse O
of O
water O
. O
But O
with O
all O
their O
eyes O
again O
riveted O
upon O
the O
swart O
Fedallah O
and O
his O
crew O
, O
the O
inmates O
of O
the O
other O
boats O
obeyed O
not O
the O
command O
. O
" O
Captain O
Ahab O
? O
— O
'' O
said O
Starbuck O
. O
" O
Spread O
yourselves O
, O
" O
cried O
Ahab O
; O
" O
give O
way O
, O
all O
four O
boats O
. O
Thou O
, O
Flask O
, O

out O
more O
to O
leeward O
! O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
sir O
, O
" O
cheerily O
cried O
little O
King-Post O
, O
sweeping O
round O
his O
great O
steering O
oar O
. O
" O
Lay O
back O
! O
" O
addressing O
his O
crew O
. O
" O

" O
" O
Oh O

said O
Archy O
; O
" O

knew O
it O
all O
before O

. O
Did O

I O
hear O
'em O

And O
did O

I O
tell O
Cabaco O

fine O

my O
children O

my O
little O
ones O
, O
" O
drawlingly O
and O
soothingly O
sighed O
Stubb O
to O
his O
crew O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
still O
showed O
signs O
of O
uneasiness O
. O
" O
Why O
do O
n't O
you O
break O
your O
backbones O
, O
my O
boys O
? O
What O
is O
it O
you O
stare O
at O
? O
Those O
chaps O

yonder O
boat O

They O

only O
five O
more O
hands O

us—never O

Pull O
, O
then O
, O
do O
pull O
; O
never O
mind O
the O
brimstone—devils O
are O
good O
fellows O
enough O

So O
, O
so O
; O
there O
you O
are O
now O
; O
that O
's O
the O
stroke O
for O
a O
thousand O
pounds O
; O
that O
's O
the O
stroke O
to O
sweep O
the O
stakes O

Hurrah O

gold O

a O

Why O

you O
snap O
your O
oars O

you O
rascals O
? O
Bite O
something O

you O

So O
, O
so O

so O

then O
; O
—softly O

softly O

That O
's O
it—that O

something O

" O
Stubb O
's O
exordium O
to O
his O
crew O
is O
given O
here O
at O
large O
, O
because O
he O
had O
rather O
a O
peculiar O
way O
of O
talking O
to O
them O
in O
general O
, O
and O
especially O
in O
inculcating O
the O
religion O
of O
rowing O
. O
But O
you O
must O
not O
suppose O
from O
this O
specimen O
of O
his O
sermonizings O
that O
he O
ever O
flew O
into O
downright O
passions O
with O
his O
congregation O
. O
Not O
at O
all O
; O
and O
therein O
consisted O
his O
chief O
peculiarity O
. O
He O
would O
say O
the O
most O
terrific O
things O
to O
his O
crew O
, O
in O
a O
tone O
so O
strangely O
compounded O
of O
fun O
and O
fury O
, O
and O
the O
fury O
seemed O
so O
calculated O
merely O
as O
a O
spice O
to O
the O
fun O
, O
that O
no O
oarsman O
could O
hear O
such O
queer O
invocations O
without O
pulling O
for O
dear O
life O
, O
and O
yet O
pulling O
for O
the O
mere O
joke O
of O
the O
thing O
. O
Besides O
he O
all O
the O
time O
looked O
so O
easy O
and O
indolent O
himself O
, O
so O
loungingly O
managed O
his O
steering-oar O
, O
and O
so O
broadly O
gaped—open-mouthed O
at O
times—that O
the O
mere O
sight O
of O
such O
a O
yawning O
commander O
, O
by O
sheer O
force O
of O
contrast O
, O
acted O
like O
a O
charm O
upon O
the O
crew O
. O
Then O
again O
, O
Stubb O
was O
one O
of O
those O
odd O
sort O
of O
humorists O
, O
whose O
jollity O
is O
sometimes O
so O
curiously O
ambiguous O
, O
as O
to O
put O
all O
inferiors O
on O
their O
guard O
in O
the O
matter O
of O
obeying O
them O
. O
In O
obedience O
to O
a O
sign O
from O
Ahab O
, O
Starbuck O
was O
now O
pulling O
obliquely O
across O
Stubb O
's O
bow O
; O
and O
when O
for O
a O
minute O
or O
so O
the O
two O
boats O
were O
pretty O
near O
to O
each O
other O
, O
Stubb O
hailed O
the O
mate O
. O
" O
Mr. O
Starbuck O
! O
larboard O
boat O
there O
, O
ahoy O
! O
a O
word O
with O
ye O
, O
sir O
, O
if O
ye O
please O
! O
" O
" O
Halloa O
! O
" O
returned O
Starbuck O
, O
turning O
round O
not O
a O
single O
inch O
as O
he O
spoke O
; O
still O
earnestly O
but O
whisperingly O
urging O
his O
crew O
; O
his O
face O
set O
like O
a O
flint O
from O
Stubb O
's O
. O
" O
What O
think O
ye O
of O
those O
yellow O
boys O
, O
sir O
! O
'' O
" O
Smuggled O
on O
board O
, O
somehow O
, O
before O
the O
ship O
sailed O
. O
( O
Strong O
, O
strong O
, O
boys O
! O
) O
" O
in O
a O
whisper O
to O
his O
crew O
, O
then O
speaking O
out O
loud O
again O
: O
" O
A O
sad O
business O
, O
Mr. O
Stubb O
! O
( O
seethe O
her O
, O
seethe O
her O
, O
my O
lads O
! O
) O
but O
never O
mind O
, O
Mr. O
Stubb O
, O
all O
for O
the O
best O
. O
Let O
all O
your O
crew O
pull O
strong O
, O
come O
what O
will O
. O
( O
Spring O
, O
my O
men O
, O
spring O
! O
) O
There O
's O
hogsheads O
of O
sperm O
ahead O
, O
Mr. O
Stubb O
, O
and O
that O
's O
what O
ye O
came O
for O
. O
( O
Pull O
, O
my O
boys O
! O
) O
Sperm O
, O
sperm O
's O
the O
play O
! O
This O
at O
least O
is O
duty O
; O
duty O
and O
profit O
hand O
in O
hand O
! O
" O
" O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
I O
thought O
as O
much O
, O
" O
soliloquized O
Stubb O
, O
when O
the O
boats O
diverged O
, O
" O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
clapt O
eye O
on O
'em O
, O
I O
thought O
so O
. O
Aye O
, O
and O
that O
's O
what O
he O
went O
into O
the O
after O
hold O
for O
, O
so O
often O
, O
as O
Dough-Boy O
long O
suspected O
. O
They O
were O
hidden O
down O
there O
. O
The O
White O
Whale O
's O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
it O
. O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
so O
be O
it O

All O

, O
men O
! O
It O
ai O

the O
White O
Whale O
to-day O
! O
Give O
way O
! O
" O
Now O
the O
advent O
of O
these O
outlandish O
strangers O
at O
such O
a O
critical O
instant O
as O
the O
lowering O
of O
the O
boats O
from O
the O
deck O
, O
this O
had O
not O
unreasonably O
awakened O
a O
sort O
of O
superstitious O
amazement O
in O
some O
of O
the O
ship O
's O
company O
; O
but O
Archy O
's O
fancied O
discovery O
having O
some O
time O
previous O
got O
abroad O
among O
them O
, O
though O
indeed O
not O
credited O
then O
, O
this O
had O
in O
some O
small O
measure O
prepared O
them O
for O
the O
event O
. O
It O
took O
off O
the O
extreme O
edge O
of O
their O
wonder O
; O
and O
so O
what O
with O
all O
this O
and O
Stubb O
's O
confident O
way O
of O
accounting O
for O
their O
appearance O
, O
they O
were O
for O
the O
time O
freed O
from O
superstitious O
surmisings O
; O
though O
the O
affair O
still O
left O
abundant O
room O
for O
all O
manner O
of O
wild O
conjectures O
as O
to O
dark O
Ahab O
's O
precise O
agency O
in O
the O
matter O
from O
the O
beginning O
. O
For O
me O
, O
I O
silently O
recalled O
the O
mysterious O
shadows O
I O
had O
seen O
creeping O
on O
board O
the O
Pequod O
during O
the O
dim O
Nantucket O
dawn O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
enigmatical O
hintings O
of O
the O
unaccountable O
Elijah O
. O
Meantime O
, O
Ahab O
, O
out O
of O
hearing O
of O
his O
officers O
, O
having O
sided O
the O
furthest O
to O
windward O
, O
was O
still O
ranging O
ahead O
of O
the O
other O
boats O
; O
a O
circumstance O
bespeaking O
how O
potent O
a O
crew O
was O
pulling O
him O
. O
Those O
tiger O
yellow O
creatures O
of O
his O
seemed O
all O
steel O
and O
whalebone O
; O
like O
five O
trip-hammers O
they O
rose O
and O
fell O
with O
regular O
strokes O
of O
strength O
, O
which O
periodically O
started O
the O
boat O
along O
the O
water O
like O
a O
horizontal O
burst O
boiler O
out O
of O
a O
Mississippi O
steamer O
. O
As O
for O
Fedallah O
, O
who O
was O
seen O
pulling O
the O
harpooneer O
oar O
, O
he O
had O
thrown O
aside O
his O
black O
jacket O
, O
and O
displayed O
his O
naked O
chest O
with O
the O
whole O
part O
of O
his O
body O
above O
the O
gunwale O
, O
clearly O
cut O
against O
the O
alternating O
depressions O
of O
the O
watery O
horizon O
; O
while O
at O
the O
other O
end O
of O
the O
boat O
Ahab O
, O
with O
one O
arm O
, O
like O
a O
fencer O
's O
, O
thrown O
half O
backward O
into O
the O
air O
, O
as O
if O
to O
counterbalance O
any O
tendency O
to O
trip O
; O
Ahab O
was O
seen O
steadily O
managing O
his O
steering O
oar O
as O
in O
a O
thousand O
boat O
lowerings O
ere O
the O
White O
Whale O
had O
torn O
him O
. O
All O
at O
once O
the O
outstretched O
arm O
gave O
a O
peculiar O
motion O
and O
then O
remained O
fixed O
, O
while O
the O
boat O
's O
five O
oars O
were O
seen O
simultaneously O
peaked O
. O
Boat O
and O
crew O
sat O
motionless O
on O
the O
sea O
. O
Instantly O
the O
three O
spread O
boats O
in O
the O
rear O
paused O
on O
their O
way O
. O
The O
whales O
had O
irregularly O
settled O
bodily O
down O
into O
the O
blue O
, O
thus O
giving O
no O
distantly O
discernible O
token O
of O
the O
movement O
, O
though O
from O
his O
closer O
vicinity O
Ahab O
had O
observed O
it O
. O
" O
Every O
man O
look O
out O
along O
his O
oar O
! O
" O
cried O
Starbuck O
. O
" O
Thou O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
stand O
up O
! O
" O
Nimbly O
springing O
up O
on O
the O
triangular O
raised O
box O
in O
the O
bow O
, O
the O
savage O
stood O
erect O
there O
, O
and O
with O
intensely O
eager O
eyes O
gazed O
off O
towards O
the O
spot O
where O
the O
chase O
had O
last O
been O
descried O
. O
Likewise O
upon O
the O
extreme O
stern O
of O
the O
boat O
where O
it O
was O
also O
triangularly O
platformed O
level O
with O
the O
gunwale O
, O
Starbuck O
himself O
was O
seen O
coolly O
and O
adroitly O
balancing O
himself O
to O
the O
jerking O
tossings O
of O
his O
chip O
of O
a O
craft O
, O
and O
silently O
eyeing O
the O
vast O
blue O
eye O
of O
the O
sea O
. O
Not O
very O
far O
distant O
Flask O
's O
boat O
was O
also O
lying O
breathlessly O
still O
; O
its O
commander O
recklessly O
standing O
upon O
the O
top O
of O
the O
loggerhead O
, O
a O
stout O
sort O
of O
post O
rooted O
in O
the O
keel O
, O
and O
rising O
some O
two O
feet O
above O
the O
level O
of O
the O
stern O
platform O
. O
It O
is O
used O
for O
catching O
turns O
with O
the O
whale O
line O
. O
Its O
top O
is O
not O
more O
spacious O
than O
the O
palm O
of O
a O
man O
's O
hand O
, O
and O
standing O
upon O
such O
a O
base O
as O
that O
, O
Flask O
seemed O
perched O
at O
the O
mast-head O
of O
some O
ship O
which O
had O
sunk O
to O
all O
but O
her O
trucks O
. O
But O
little O
King-Post O
was O
small O
and O
short O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
little O
King-Post O
was O
full O
of O
a O
large O
and O
tall O
ambition O
, O
so O
that O
this O
loggerhead O
stand-point O
of O
his O
did O
by O
no O
means O
satisfy O
King-Post O
. O
" O
I O
ca O
n't O
see O
three O
seas O
off O
; O
tip O
us O
up O
an O
oar O
there O
, O
and O
let O
me O
on O
to O
that O
. O
'' O
Upon O
this O
, O
Daggoo O
, O
with O
either O
hand O
upon O
the O
gunwale O
to O
steady O
his O
way O
, O
swiftly O
slid O
aft O
, O
and O
then O
erecting O
himself O
volunteered O
his O
lofty O
shoulders O
for O
a O
pedestal O
. O
" O
Good O
a O
mast-head O
as O
any O
, O
sir O
. O
Will O
you O
mount O
? O
" O
" O
That O
I O
will O
, O
and O
thank O
ye O
very O
much O
, O
my O
fine O
fellow O
; O
only O
I O
wish O
you O
fifty O
feet O
taller O
. O
" O
Whereupon O
planting O
his O
feet O
firmly O
against O
two O
opposite O
planks O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
the O
gigantic O
negro O
, O
stooping O
a O
little O
, O
presented O
his O
flat O
palm O
to O
Flask O
's O
foot O
, O
and O
then O
putting O
Flask O
's O
hand O
on O
his O
hearse-plumed O
head O
and O
bidding O
him O
spring O
as O
he O
himself O
should O
toss O
, O
with O
one O
dexterous O
fling O
landed O
the O
little O
man O
high O
and O
dry O
on O
his O
shoulders O
. O
And O
here O
was O
Flask O
now O
standing O
, O
Daggoo O
with O
one O
lifted O
arm O
furnishing O
him O
with O
a O
breast-band O
to O
lean O
against O
and O
steady O
himself O
by O
. O
At O
any O
time O
it O
is O
a O
strange O
sight O
to O
the O
tyro O
to O
see O
with O
what O
wondrous O
habitude O
of O
unconscious O
skill O
the O
whaleman O
will O
maintain O
an O
erect O
posture O
in O
his O
boat O
, O
even O
when O
pitched O
about O
by O
the O
most O
riotously O
perverse O
and O
cross-running O
seas O
. O
Still O
more O
strange O
to O
see O
him O
giddily O
perched O
upon O
the O
loggerhead O
itself O
, O
under O
such O
circumstances O
. O
But O
the O
sight O
of O
little O
Flask O
mounted O
upon O
gigantic O
Daggoo O
was O
yet O
more O
curious O
; O
for O
sustaining O
himself O
with O
a O
cool O
, O
indifferent O
, O
easy O
, O
unthought O
of O
, O
barbaric O
majesty O
, O
the O
noble O
negro O
to O
every O
roll O
of O
the O
sea O
harmoniously O
rolled O
his O
fine O
form O
. O
On O
his O
broad O
back O
, O
flaxen-haired O
Flask O
seemed O
a O
snow-flake O
. O
The O
bearer O
looked O
nobler O
than O
the O
rider O
. O
Though O
, O
truly O
, O
vivacious O
, O
tumultuous O
, O
ostentatious O
little O
Flask O
would O
now O
and O
then O
stamp O
with O
impatience O
; O
but O
not O
one O
added O
heave O
did O
he O
thereby O
give O
to O
the O
negro O
's O
lordly O
chest O
. O
So O
have O
I O
seen O
Passion O
and O
Vanity O
stamping O
the O
living O
magnanimous O
earth O
, O
but O
the O
earth O
did O
not O
alter O
her O
tides O
and O
her O
seasons O
for O
that O
. O
Meanwhile O
Stubb O
, O
the O
third O
mate O
, O
betrayed O
no O
such O
far-gazing O
solicitudes O
. O
The O
whales O
might O
have O
made O
one O
of O
their O
regular O
soundings O
, O
not O
a O
temporary O
dive O
from O
mere O
fright O
; O
and O
if O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
Stubb O
, O
as O
his O
wont O
in O
such O
cases O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
was O
resolved O
to O
solace O
the O
languishing O
interval O
with O
his O
pipe O
. O
He O
withdrew O
it O
from O
his O
hatband O
, O
where O
he O
always O
wore O
it O
aslant O
like O
a O
feather O
. O
He O
loaded O
it O
, O
and O
rammed O
home O
the O
loading O
with O
his O
thumb-end O
; O
but O
hardly O
had O
he O
ignited O
his O
match O
across O
the O
rough O
sand-paper O
of O
his O
hand O
, O
when O
Tashtego O
, O
his O
harpoonccr O
, O
whose O
eyes O
had O
been O
setting O
to O
windward O
like O
two O
fixed O
stars O
, O
suddenly O
dropped O
like O
light O
from O
his O
erect O
attitude O
to O
his O
seat O
, O
crying O
out O
in O
a O
quick O
phrensy O
of O
hurry O
, O
" O
Down O
, O
down O
all O
, O
and O
give O
way O
! O
—there O
they O
are O
! O
" O
To O
a O
landsman O
, O
no O
whale O
, O
nor O
any O
sign O
of O
a O
herring O
, O
would O
have O
been O
visible O
at O
that O
moment O
; O
nothing O
but O
a O
troubled O
bit O
of O
greenish O
white O
water O
, O
and O
thin O
scattered O
puffs O
of O
vapor O
hovering O
over O
it O
, O
and O
suffusingly O
blowing O
off O
to O
leeward O
, O
like O
the O
confused O
scud O
from O
white O
rolling O
billows O
. O
The O
air O
around O
suddenly O
vibrated O
and O
tingled O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
like O
the O
air O
over O
intensely O
heated O
plates O
of O
iron O
. O
Beneath O
this O
atmospheric O
waving O
and O
curling O
, O
and O
partially O
beneath O
a O
thin O
layer O
of O
water O
, O
also O
, O
the O
whales O
were O
swimming O
. O
Seen O
in O
advance O
of O
all O
the O
other O
indications O
, O
the O
puffs O
of O
vapor O
they O
spouted O
, O
seemed O
their O
forerunning O
couriers O
and O
detached O
flying O
outriders O
. O
All O
four O
boats O
were O
now O
in O
keen O
pursuit O
of O
that O
one O
spot O
of O
troubled O
water O
and O
air O
. O
But O
it O
bade O
fair O
to O
outstrip O
them O
; O
it O
flew O
on O
and O
on O
, O
as O
a O
mass O
of O
interblending O
bubbles O
borne O
down O
a O
rapid O
stream O
from O
the O
hills O
. O
" O
Pull O
, O
pull O
, O
my O
good O
boys O
, O
" O
said O
Starbuck O
, O
in O
the O
lowest O
possible O
but O
intensest O
concentrated O
whisper O
to O
his O
men O
; O
while O
the O
sharp O
fixed O
glance O
from O
his O
eyes O
, O
darted O
straight O
ahead O
of O
the O
bow O
, O
almost O
seemed O
as O
two O
visible O
needles O
in O
two O
unerring O
binnacle O
compasses O
. O
He O
did O
not O
say O
much O
to O
his O
crew O
, O
though O
, O
nor O
did O
his O
crew O
say O
anything O
to O
him O
. O
Only O
the O
silence O
of O
the O
boat O
was O
at O
intervals O
startlingly O
pierced O
by O
one O
of O
his O
peculiar O
whispers O
, O
now O
harsh O
with O
command O
, O
now O
soft O
with O
entreaty O
. O
How O
different O
the O
loud O
little O
King-Post O
. O
'' O
Sing O
out O
and O
say O
something O
, O
my O
hearties O
. O
Roar O
and O
pull O
, O
my O
thunderbolts O
! O
Beach O
me O
, O
beach O
me O
on O
their O
black O
backs O
, O
boys O
; O
only O
do O
that O
for O
me O
, O
and O
I O
'll O
sign O
over O
to O
you O
my O
Martha O
's O
Vineyard O
plantation O
, O
boys O
; O
including O
wife O
and O
children O
, O
boys O
. O
Lay O
me O
on—lay O
me O
on O
! O
O O
Lord O
, O
Lord O
! O
but O
I O
shall O
go O
stark O
, O
staring O
mad O
: O
See O
! O
see O
that O
white O
water O
! O
" O
And O
so O
shouting O
, O
he O
pulled O
his O
hat O
from O
his O
head O
, O
and O
stamped O
up O
and O
down O
on O
it O
; O
then O
picking O
it O
up O
, O
flirted O
it O
far O
off O
upon O
the O
sea O
; O
and O
finally O
fell O
to O
rearing O
and O
plunging O
in O
the O
boat O
's O
stern O
like O
a O
crazed O
colt O
from O
the O
prairie O
. O
" O
Look O
at O
that O
chap O
now O
, O
" O
philosophically O
drawled O
Stubb O
, O
who O
, O
with O
his O
unlighted O
short O
pipe O
, O
mechanically O
retained O
between O
his O
teeth O
, O
at O
a O
short O
distance O
, O
followed O
after— O
" O
He O
's O
got O
fits O
, O
that O
Flask O
has O
. O
Fits O
? O
yes O
, O
give O
him O
fits—that O
's O
the O
very O
word—pitch O
fits O
into O
'em O
. O
Merrily O
, O
merrily O
, O
hearts-alive O
. O
Pudding O
for O
supper O
, O
you O
know O
; O
—merry O
's O
the O
word O
. O
Pull O
, O
babes O
—pull O
, O
sucklings—pull O
, O
all O
. O
But O
what O
the O
devil O
are O
you O
hurrying O
about O
? O
Softly O
, O
softly O
, O
and O
steadily O
, O
my O
men O
. O
Only O
pull O
, O
and O
keep O
pulling O
; O
nothing O
more O
. O
Crack O
all O
your O
backbones O
, O
and O
bite O
your O
knives O
in O
two—that O
's O
all O
. O
Take O
it O
easy—why O
do O
n't O
ye O
take O
it O
easy O
, O
I O
say O
, O
and O
burst O
all O
your O
livers O
and O
lungs O
! O
" O
But O
what O
it O
was O
that O
inscrutable O
Ahab O
said O
to O
that O
tiger-yellow O
crew O
of O
his—these O
were O
words O
best O
omitted O
here O
; O
for O
you O
live O
under O
the O
blessed O
light O
of O
the O
evangelical O
land O
. O
Only O
the O
infidel O
sharks O
in O
the O
audacious O
seas O
may O
give O
ear O
to O
such O
words O
, O
when O
, O
with O
tornado O
brow O
, O
and O
eyes O
of O
red O
murder O
, O
and O
foam-glued O
lips O
, O
Ahab O
leaped O
after O
his O
prey O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
all O
the O
boats O
tore O
on O
. O
The O
repeated O
specific O
allusions O
of O
Flask O
to O
" O
that O
whale O
, O
" O
as O
he O
called O
the O
fictitious O
monster O
which O
he O
declared O
to O
be O
incessantly O
tantalizing O
his O
boat O
's O
bow O
with O
its O
tail—these O
allusions O
of O
his O
were O
at O
times O
so O
vivid O
and O
life-like O
, O
that O
they O
would O
cause O
some O
one O
or O
two O
of O
his O
men O
to O
snatch O
a O
fearful O
look O
over O
the O
shoulder O
. O
But O
this O
was O
against O
all O
rule O
; O
for O
the O
oarsmen O
must O
put O
out O
their O
eyes O
, O
and O
ram O
a O
skewer O
through O
their O
necks O
; O
usage O
pronouncing O
that O
they O
must O
have O
no O
organs O
but O
ears O
, O
and O
no O
limbs O
but O
arms O
, O
in O
these O
critical O
moments O
. O
It O
was O
a O
sight O
full O
of O
quick O
wonder O
and O
awe O
! O
The O
vast O
swells O
of O
the O
omnipotent O
sea O
; O
the O
surging O
, O
hollow O
roar O
they O
made O
, O
as O
they O
rolled O
along O
the O
eight O
gunwales O
, O
like O
gigantic O
bowls O
in O
a O
boundless O
bowling-green O
; O
the O
brief O
suspended O
agony O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
as O
it O
would O
tip O
for O
an O
instant O
on O
the O
knife-like O
edge O
of O
the O
sharper O
waves O
, O
that O
almost O
seemed O
threatening O
to O
cut O
it O
in O
two O
; O
the O
sudden O
profound O
dip O
into O
the O
watery O
glens O
and O
hollows O
; O
the O
keen O
spurrings O
and O
goadings O
to O
gain O
the O
top O
of O
the O
opposite O
hill O
; O
the O
headlong O
, O
sled-like O
slide O
down O
its O
other O
side O
; O
—all O
these O
, O
with O
the O
cries O
of O
the O
headsmen O
and O
harpooneers O
, O
and O
the O
shuddering O
gasps O
of O
the O
oarsmen O
, O
with O
the O
wondrous O
sight O
of O
the O
ivory O
Pequod O
bearing O
down O
upon O
her O
boats O
with O
outstretched O
sails O
, O
like O
a O
wild O
hen O
after O
her O
screaming O
brood O
; O
—all O
this O
was O
thrilling O
. O
Not O
the O
raw O
recruit O
, O
marching O
from O
the O
bosom O
of O
his O
wife O
into O
the O
fever O
heat O
of O
his O
first O
battle O
; O
not O
the O
dead O
man O
's O
ghost O
encountering O
the O
first O
unknown O
phantom O
in O
the O
other O
world O
; O
—neither O
of O
these O
can O
feel O
stranger O
and O
stronger O
emotions O
than O
that O
man O
does O
, O
who O
for O
the O
first O
time O
finds O
himself O
pulling O
into O
the O
charmed O
, O
churned O
circle O
of O
the O
hunted O
sperm O
whale O
. O
The O
dancing O
white O
water O
made O
by O
the O
chase O
was O
now O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
visible O
, O
owing O
to O
the O
increasing O
darkness O
of O
the O
dun O
cloud-shadows O
flung O
upon O
the O
sea O
. O
The O
jets O
of O
vapor O
no O
longer O
blended O
, O
but O
tilted O
everywhere O
to O
right O
and O
left O
; O
the O
whales O
seemed O
separating O
their O
wakes O
. O
The O
boats O
were O
pulled O
more O
apart O
; O
Starbuck O
giving O
chase O
to O
three O
whales O
running O
dead O
to O
leeward O
. O
Our O
sail O
was O
now O
set O
, O
and O
, O
with O
the O
still O
rising O
wind O
, O
we O
rushed O
along O
; O
the O
boat O
going O
with O
such O
madness O
through O
the O
water O
, O
that O
the O
lee O
oars O
could O
scarcely O
be O
worked O
rapidly O
enough O
to O
escape O
being O
torn O
from O
the O
row-locks O
. O
Soon O
we O
were O
running O
through O
a O
suffusing O
wide O
veil O
of O
mist O
; O
neither O
ship O
nor O
boat O
to O
be O
seen O
. O
'' O
Give O
way O
, O
men O
, O
" O
whispered O
Starbuck O
, O
drawing O
still O
further O
aft O
the O
sheet O
of O
his O
sail O
; O
" O
there O
is O
time O
to O
kill O
a O
fish O
yet O
before O
the O
squall O
comes O
. O
There O
's O
white O
water O
again O
! O
—close O
to O
! O
Spring O
! O
" O
Soon O
after O
, O
two O
cries O
in O
quick O
succession O
on O
each O
side O
of O
us O
denoted O
that O
the O
other O
boats O
had O
got O
fast O
; O
but O
hardly O
were O
they O
overheard O
, O
when O
with O
a O
lightning-like O
hurtling O
whisper O
Starbuck O
said O
: O
" O
Stand O
up O
! O
" O
and O
Queequeg O
, O
harpoon O
in O
hand O
, O
sprang O
to O
his O
feet O
. O
Though O
not O
one O
of O
the O
oarsmen O
was O
then O
facing O
the O
life O
and O
death O
peril O
so O
close O
to O
them O
ahead O
, O
yet O
with O
their O
eyes O
on O
the O
intense O
countenance O
of O
the O
mate O
in O
the O
stern O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
they O
knew O
that O
the O
imminent O
instant O
had O
come O
; O
they O
heard O
, O
too O
, O
an O
enormous O
wallowing O
sound O
as O
of O
fifty O
elephants O
stirring O
in O
their O
litter O
. O
Meanwhile O
the O
boat O
was O
still O
booming O
through O
the O
mist O
, O
the O
waves O
curling O
and O
hissing O
around O
us O
like O
the O
erected O
crests O
of O
enraged O
serpents O
. O
" O
That O
's O
his O
hump O
. O
There O
, O
there O
, O
give O
it O
to O
him O
! O
" O
whispered O
Starbuck O
. O
A O
short O
rushing O
sound O
leaped O
out O
of O
the O
boat O
; O
it O
was O
the O
darted O
iron O
of O
Queequeg O
. O
Then O
all O
in O
one O
welded O
commotion O
came O
an O
invisible O
push O
from O
astern O
, O
while O
forward O
the O
boat O
seemed O
striking O
on O
a O
ledge O
; O
the O
sail O
collapsed O
and O
exploded O
; O
a O
gush O
of O
scalding O
vapor O
shot O
up O
near O
by O
; O
something O
rolled O
and O
tumbled O
like O
an O
earthquake O
beneath O
us O
. O
The O
whole O
crew O
were O
half O
suffocated O
as O
they O
were O
tossed O
helter-skelter O
into O
the O
white O
curdling O
cream O
of O
the O
squall O
. O
Squall O
, O
whale O
, O
and O
harpoon O
had O
all O
blended O
together O
; O
and O
the O
whale O
, O
merely O
grazed O
by O
the O
iron O
, O
escaped O
. O
Though O
completely O
swamped O
, O
the O
boat O
was O
nearly O
unharmed O
. O
Swim- O
ming O
round O
it O
we O
picked O
up O
the O
floating O
oars O
, O
and O
lashing O
them O
across O
the O
gunwale O
, O
tumbled O
back O
to O
our O
places O
. O
There O
we O
sat O
up O
to O
our O
knees O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
water O
covering O
every O
rib O
and O
plank O
, O
so O
that O
to O
our O
downward O
gazing O
eyes O
the O
suspended O
craft O
seemed O
a O
coral O
boat O
grown O
up O
to O
us O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
ocean O
. O
The O
wind O
increased O
to O
a O
howl O
; O
the O
waves O
dashed O
their O
bucklers O
together O
; O
the O
whole O
squall O
roared O
, O
forked O
, O
and O
crackled O
around O
us O
like O
a O
white O
fire O
upon O
the O
prairie O
, O
in O
which O
, O
unconsumed O
, O
we O
were O
burning O
; O
immortal O
in O
these O
jaws O
of O
death O
! O
In O
vain O
we O
hailed O
the O
other O
boats O
; O
as O
well O
roar O
to O
the O
live O
coals O
down O
the O
chimney O
of O
a O
flaming O
furnace O
as O
hail O
those O
boats O
in O
that O
storm O
. O
Meanwhile O
the O
driving O
scud O
, O
rack O
, O
and O
mist O
, O
grew O
darker O
with O
the O
shadows O
of O
night O
; O
no O
sign O
of O
the O
ship O
could O
be O
seen O
. O
The O
rising O
sea O
forbade O
all O
attempts O
to O
bale O
out O
the O
boat O
. O
The O
oars O
were O
useless O
as O
propellers O
, O
performing O
now O
the O
office O
of O
life-preservers O
. O
So O
, O
cutting O
the O
lashing O
of O
the O
waterproof O
match O
keg O
, O
after O
many O
failures O
Starbuck O
contrived O
to O
ignite O
the O
lamp O
in O
the O
lantern O
; O
then O
stretching O
it O
on O
a O
waif O
pole O
, O
handed O
it O
to O
Queequeg O
as O
the O
standard-bearer O
of O
this O
forlorn O
hope O
. O
There O
, O
then O
, O
he O
sat O
, O
holding O
up O
that O
imbecile O
candle O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
that O
almighty O
forlornness O
. O
There O
, O
then O
, O
he O
sat O
, O
the O
sign O
and O
symbol O
of O
a O
man O
without O
faith O
, O
hopelessly O
holding O
up O
hope O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
despair O
. O
Wet O
, O
drenched O
through O
, O
and O
shivering O
cold O
, O
despairing O
of O
ship O
or O
boat O
, O
we O
lifted O
up O
our O
eyes O
as O
the O
dawn O
came O
on O
. O
The O
mist O
still O
spread O
over O
the O
sea O
, O
the O
empty O
lantern O
lay O
crushed O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
boat O
. O
Suddenly O
Queequeg O
started O
to O
his O
feet O
, O
hollowing O
his O
hand O
to O
his O
ear O
. O
We O
all O
heard O
a O
faint O
creaking O
, O
as O
of O
ropes O
and O
yards O
hitherto O
muffled O
by O
the O
storm O
. O
The O
sound O
came O
nearer O
and O
nearer O
; O
the O
thick O
mists O
were O
dimly O
parted O
by O
a O
huge O
, O
vague O
form O
. O
Affrighted O
, O
we O
all O
sprang O
into O
the O
sea O
as O
the O
ship O
at O
last O
loomed O
into O
view O
, O
bearing O
right O
down O
upon O
us O
within O
a O
distance O
of O
not O
much O
more O
than O
its O
length O
. O
Floating O
on O
the O
waves O
we O
saw O
the O
abandoned O
boat O
, O
as O
for O
one O
instant O
it O
tossed O
and O
gaped O
beneath O
the O
ship O
's O
bows O
like O
a O
chip O
at O
the O
base O
of O
a O
cataract O
; O
and O
then O
the O
vast O
hull O
rolled O
over O
it O
, O
and O
it O
was O
seen O
no O
more O
till O
it O
came O
up O
weltering O
astern O
. O
Again O
we O
swam O
for O
it O
, O
were O
dashed O
against O
it O
by O
the O
seas O
, O
and O
were O
at O
last O
taken O
up O
and O
safely O
landed O
on O
board O
. O
Ere O
the O
squall O
came O
close O
to O
, O
the O
other O
boats O
had O
cut O
loose O
from O
their O
fish O
and O
returned O
to O
the O
ship O
in O
good O
time O
. O
The O
ship O
had O
given O
us O
up O
, O
but O
was O
still O
cruising O
, O
if O
haply O
it O
might O
light O
upon O
some O
token O
of O
our O
perishing O
, O
—an O
oar O
or O
a O
lance O
pole O
. O
