I O
had O
not O
been O
seated O
very O
long O
ere O
a O
man O
of O
a O
certain O
venerable O
robustness O
entered O
; O
immediately O
as O
the O
storm-pelted O
door O
flew O
back O
upon O
admitting O
him O
, O
a O
quick O
regardful O
eyeing O
of O
him O
by O
all O
the O
congregation O
sufficiently O
attested O
that O
this O
fine O
old O
man O
was O
the O
chaplain O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
was O
the O
famous O
Father O
Mapple O
, O
so O
called O
by O
the O
whalemen O
, O
among O
whom O
he O
was O
a O
very O
great O
favourite O
. O
He O
had O
been O
a O
sailor O
and O
a O
harpooner O
in O
his O
youth O
, O
but O
for O
many O
years O
past O
had O
dedicated O
his O
life O
to O
the O
ministry O
. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
now O
write O
of O
, O
Father O
Mapple O
was O
in O
the O
hardy O
winter O
of O
a O
healthy O
old O
age O
; O
that O
sort O
of O
old O
age O
which O
seems O
merging O
into O
a O
second O
flowering O
youth O
, O
for O
among O
all O
the O
fissures O
of O
his O
wrinkles O
, O
there O
shone O
certain O
mild O
gleams O
of O
a O
newly O
developing O
bloom—the O
spring O
verdure O
peeping O
forth O
even O
beneath O
February O
's O
snow O
. O
No O
one O
having O
previously O
heard O
his O
history O
, O
could O
for O
the O
first O
time O
behold O
Father O
Mapple O
without O
the O
utmost O
interest O
, O
because O
there O
were O
certain O
engrafted O
clerical O
peculiarities O
about O
him O
, O
imputable O
to O
that O
adventurous O
maritime O
life O
he O
had O
led O
. O
When O
he O
entered O
, O
I O
observed O
that O
he O
carried O
no O
umbrella O
, O
and O
certainly O
had O
not O
come O
in O
his O
carriage O
, O
for O
his O
tarpaulin O
hat O
ran O
down O
with O
melting O
sleet O
, O
and O
his O
great O
pilot-cloth O
jacket O
seemed O
almost O
to O
drag O
him O
to O
the O
floor O
with O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
water O
it O
had O
absorbed O
. O
However O
, O
hat O
and O
coat O
and O
overshoes O
were O
one O
by O
one O
removed O
, O
and O
hung O
up O
in O
a O
little O
space O
in O
an O
adjacent O
corner O
; O
when O
, O
arrayed O
in O
a O
decent O
suit O
, O
he O
quietly O
approached O
the O
pulpit O
. O
Like O
most O
old-fashioned O
pulpits O
, O
it O
was O
a O
very O
lofty O
one O
, O
and O
since O
a O
regular O
stairs O
to O
such O
a O
height O
would O
, O
by O
its O
long O
angle O
with O
the O
floor O
, O
seriously O
contract O
the O
already O
small O
area O
of O
the O
chapel O
, O
the O
architect O
, O
it O
seemed O
, O
had O
acted O
upon O
the O
hint O
of O
Father O
Mapple O
, O
and O
finished O
the O
pulpit O
without O
'stairs O
, O
substituting O
a O
perpendicular O
side O
ladder O
, O
like O
those O
used O
in O
mounting O
a O
ship O
from O
a O
boat O
at O
sea O
. O
The O
wife O
of O
a O
whaling O
captain O
had O
provided O
the O
chapel O
with O
a O
handsome O
pair O
of O
red O
worsted O
manropes O
for O
this O
ladder O
, O
which O
, O
being O
itself O
nicely O
headed O
, O
and O
stained O
with O
a O
mahogany O
colour O
, O
the O
whole O
contrivance O
, O
considering O
what O
manner O
of O
chapel O
it O
was O
, O
seemed O
by O
no O
means O
in O
bad O
taste O
. O
Halting O
for O
an O
instant O
at O
the O
foot O
of O
the O
ladder O
, O
and O
with O
both O
hands O
grasping O
the O
ornamental O
knobs O
of O
the O
manropes O
, O
Father O
Mapple O
cast O
a O
look O
upwards O
, O
and O
then O
with O
a O
truly O
sailor- O
like O
but O
still O
reverential O
dexterity O
, O
hand O
over O
hand O
, O
mounted O
the O
steps O
as O
if O
ascending O
the O
main-top O
of O
his O
vessel O
. O
The O
perpendicular O
parts O
of O
this O
side O
ladder O
, O
as O
is O
usually O
the O
case O
with O
swinging O
ones O
, O
were O
of O
cloth-covered O
rope O
, O
only O
the O
rounds O
were O
of O
wood O
, O
so O
that O
at O
every O
step O
there O
was O
a O
joint O
. O
At O
my O
first O
glimpse O
of O
the O
pulpit O
, O
it O
had O
not O
escaped O
me O
that O
, O
however O
convenient O
for O
a O
ship O
, O
these O
joints O
in O
the O
present O
instance O
seemed O
unnecessary O
: O
for O
I O
was O
not O
prepared O
to O
see O
Father O
Mapple O
, O
after O
gaining O
the O
height O
, O
slowly O
turn O
round O
, O
and O
stooping O
over O
the O
pulpit O
, O
deliberately O
drag O
up O
the O
ladder O
step O
by O
step O
, O
till O
the O
whole O
was O
deposited O
within O
, O
leaving O
him O
impregnable O
in O
his O
little O
Quebec O
. O
I O
pondered O
some O
time O
without O
fully O
comprehending O
the O
reason O
for O
this O
. O
Father O
Mapple O
enjoyed O
such O
a O
wide O
reputation O
for O
sincerity O
and O
sanctity O
, O
that O
I O
could O
not O
suspect O
him O
of O
courting O
notoriety O
by O
any O
mere O
tricks O
of O
the O
stage O
. O
No O
, O
thought O
I O
, O
there O
must O
be O
some O
sober O
reason O
for O
this O
thing O
; O
furthermore O
, O
it O
must O
symbolize O
something O
unseen O
. O
Can O
it O
be O
, O
then O
, O
that O
by O
that O
act O
of O
physical O
isolation O
, O
he O
signifies O
his O
spiritual O
withdrawal O
for O
the O
time O
from O
all O
outward O
worldly O
ties O
and O
connexions O
? O
Yes O
; O
for O
replenished O
with O
the O
meat O
and O
wine O
of O
the O
word O
, O
to O
the O
faithful O
man O
of O
God O
, O
this O
pulpit O
, O
I O
see O
, O
is O
a O
self-containing O
strong- O
hold—a O
lofty O
Ehrenbreitstein O
, O
with O
a O
perennial O
well O
of O
water O
within O
the O
walls O
. O
But O
the O
side O
ladder O
was O
not O
the O
only O
strange O
feature O
of O
the O
place O
, O
borrowed O
from O
the O
chaplain O
's O
former O
sea-farings O
. O
Between O
the O
marble O
cenotaphs O
on O
either O
hand O
of O
the O
pulpit O
, O
the O
wall O
which O
formed O
its O
back O
was O
adorned O
with O
a O
large O
painting O
, O
repre- O
senting O
a O
gallant O
ship O
beating O
against O
a O
terrible O
storm O
off O
a O
lee O
coast O
of O
black O
rocks O
and O
snowy O
breakers O
. O
But O
high O
above O
the O
flying O
scud O
and O
dark-rolling O
clouds O
, O
there O
floated O
a O
little O
isle O
of O
sunlight O
, O
from O
which O
beamed O
forth O
an O
angel O
's O
face O
; O
and O
this O
bright O
face O
shed O
a O
distinct O
spot O
of O
radiance O
upon O
the O
ship O
's O
tossed O
deck O
, O
something O
like O
that O
silver O
plate O
now O
inserted O
into O
the O
Victory O
's O
plank O
where O
Nelson O
fell O
. O
" O
Ah O
, O
noble O
ship O
! O
" O
the O
angel O
seemed O
to O
say O
, O
" O
beat O
on O
, O
beat O
on O
, O
thou O
noble O
ship O
, O
and O
bear O
a O
hardy O
helm O
; O
for O
lo O
! O
the O
sun O
is O
breaking O
through O
; O
the O
clouds O
are O
rolling O
off O
; O
serenest O
azure O
is O
at O
hand O
. O
" O
Nor O
was O
the O
pulpit O
itself O
without O
a O
trace O
of O
the O
same O
sea O
taste O
that O
had O
achieved O
the O
ladder O
and O
the O
picture O
. O
Its O
panelled O
front O
was O
in O
the O
likeness O
of O
a O
ship O
's O
bluff O
bows O
, O
and O
the O
Holy O
Bible O
rested O
on O
a O
projecting O
piece O
of O
scroll O
work O
, O
fashioned O
after O
a O
ship O
's O
fiddle-headed O
beak O
. O
What O
could O
be O
more O
full O
of O
meaning O
? O
—for O
the O
pulpit O
is O
ever O
this O
earth O
's O
foremost O
part O
; O
all O
the O
rest O
comes O
in O
its O
rear O
: O
the O
pulpit O
leads O
the O
world O
. O
From O
thence O
it O
is O
that O
the O
storm O
's O
quick O
wrath O
is O
first O
descried O
, O
and O
the O
bow O
must O
bear O
the O
earliest O
brunt O
. O
From O
thence O
it O
is O
that O
the O
God O
of O
breezes O
, O
fair O
or O
foul O
, O
is O
first O
invoked O
for O
favourable O
winds O
. O
Yes O
, O
the O
world O
's O
a O
ship O
on O
its O
passage O
out O
, O
and O
not O
a O
voyage O
complete O
; O
and O
the O
pulpit O
is O
its O
prow O
. O
