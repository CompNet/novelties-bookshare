THE O
intense O
Pequod O
sailed O
on O
; O
the O
rolling O
waves O
and O
days O
went O
by O
; O
the O
life-buoy-coffin O
still O
lightly O
swung O
; O
and O
another O
ship O
, O
most O
miserably O
misnamed O
the O
Delight O
, O
was O
descried O
. O
As O
she O
drew O
nigh O
, O
all O
eyes O
were O
fixed O
upon O
her O
broad O
beams O
, O
called O
shears— O
which O
, O
in O
some O
whaling-ships O
, O
cross O
the O
quarter- O
deck O
at O
the O
height O
of O
eight O
or O
nine O
feet—serving O
to O
carry O
the O
spare O
, O
unrigged O
, O
or O
disabled O
boats O
. O
Upon O
the O
stranger O
's O
shears O
were O
beheld O
the O
shattered O
, O
white O
ribs O
, O
and O
some O
few O
splintered O
planks O
, O
of O
what O
had O
once O
been O
a O
whale-boat O
; O
but O
you O
now O
saw O
through O
this O
wreck O
, O
as O
plainly O
as O
you O
see O
through O
the O
peeled O
, O
half-unhinged O
, O
and O
bleaching O
skeleton O
of O
a O
horse O
. O
" O
Hast O
seen O
the O
White O
Whale O
? O
" O
" O
Look O
! O
" O
replied O
the O
hollow-cheeked O
captain O
from O
his O
taffrail O
; O
and O
with O
his O
trumpet O
he O
pointed O
to O
the O
wreck O
. O
" O
Hast O
killed O
him O
? O
" O
" O
The O
harpoon O
is O
not O
yet O
forged O
that O
will O
ever O
do O
that O
, O
" O
answered O
the O
other O
, O
sadly O
glancing O
upon O
a O
rounded O
hammock O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
whose O
gathered O
sides O
some O
noiseless O
sailors O
were O
busy O
in O
sewing O
together O
. O
" O
Not O
forged O
! O
" O
and O
snatching O
Perth O
's O
levelled O
iron O
from O
the O
crotch O
, O
Ahab O
held O
it O
out O
, O
exclaiming O
— O
" O
Look O
ye O
, O
Nantucketer O
; O
here O
in O
this O
hand O
I O
hold O
his O
death O
! O
Tempered O
in O
blood O
, O
and O
tem- O
pered O
by O
lightning O
are O
these O
barbs O
; O
and O
I O
swear O
to O
temper O
them O
triply O
in O
that O
hot O
place O
behind O
the O
fin O
, O
where O
the O
White O
Whale O
most O
feels O
his O
ac- O
cursed O
life O
! O
" O
" O
Then O
God O
keep O
thee O
, O
old O
man-Secst O
thou O
that-pointing O
to O
the O
hammock-I O
bury O
but O
one O
of O
five O
stout O
men O
, O
who O
were O
alive O
only O
yesterday O
, O
but O
were O
dead O
ere O
night O
. O
Only O
that O
one O
I O
bury O
; O
the O
rest O
were O
buried O
before O
they O
died O
: O
you O
sail O
upon O
their O
tomb O
. O
" O
Then O
turning O
to O
his O
crew- O
" O
Are O
you O
ready O
there O
? O
Place O
the O
plank O
then O
on O
the O
rail O
, O
and O
lift O
the O
body-so O
, O
then-Oh O
! O
God-advancing O
towards O
the O
hammock O
with O
uplifted O
hands-may O
the O
resurrection O
and O
the O
life O
" O
Brace O
forward O
! O
Up O
helm O
! O
cried O
Ahab O
, O
like O
lightning O
to O
his O
men O
. O
But O
the O
suddenly O
started O
Pequod O
was O
not O
quick O
enough O
to O
escape O
the O
sound O
of O
the O
splash O
that O
the O
corpse O
soon O
made O
as O
it O
struck O
the O
sea-not O
so O
quick O
, O
indeed O
, O
but O
that O
some O
of O
the O
flying O
bubbles O
might O
have O
sprinkled O
her O
hull O
with O
their O
ghostly O
baptism O
. O
As O
Ahab O
now O
glided O
from O
the O
dejected O
Delight O
, O
the O
strange O
life-buoy O
hanging O
at O
the O
Pequod O
's O
stern O
came O
into O
conspicuous O
relief O
. O
Ha O
! O
yonder O
! O
look O
yonder O
, O
men O
! O
cried O
a O
fore- O
boding O
voice O
in O
her O
wake O
. O
In O
vain O
, O
oh O
, O
ye O
strangers O
, O
ye O
fly O
our O
sad O
burial O
. O
Ye O
but O
turn O
us O
your O
taffrail O
to O
show O
us O
your O
coffin O
! O
