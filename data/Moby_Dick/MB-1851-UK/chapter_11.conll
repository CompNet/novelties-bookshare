We O
had O
lain O
thus O
in O
bed O
, O
chatting O
and O
napping O
at O
short O
intervals O
, O
when O
, O
at O
last O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
our O
confabulations O
, O
what O
little O
napishness O
remained O
in O
us O
altogether O
departed O
, O
and O
we O
felt O
like O
getting O
up O
again O
, O
though O
daybreak O
was O
yet O
some O
way O
down O
the O
future O
. O
Yes O
, O
we O
became O
very O
wakeful O
; O
so O
much O
so O
, O
that O
our O
recumbent O
position O
began O
to O
grow O
wearisome O
, O
and O
by O
little O
and O
little O
we O
found O
ourselves O
sitting O
up O
; O
the O
clothes O
well O
tucked O
around O
us O
, O
leaning O
against O
the O
head-board O
with O
our O
four O
knees O
drawn O
up O
close O
together O
, O
and O
our O
two O
noses O
bending O
over O
them O
, O
as O
if O
our O
knee-pans O
were O
warming-pans O
. O
We O
felt O
very O
nice O
and O
snug O
, O
the O
more O
so O
since O
it O
was O
so O
chilly O
out O
of O
doors O
; O
indeed O
, O
out O
of O
bed- O
clothes O
too O
, O
seeing O
that O
there O
was O
no O
fire O
in O
the O
room O
. O
The O
more O
so O
, O
I O
say O
, O
because O
truly O
to O
enjoy O
bodily O
warmth O
, O
some O
small O
part O
of O
you O
must O
be O
cold O
; O
for O
there O
is O
no O
quality O
in O
this O
world O
that O
is O
not O
what O
it O
is O
merely O
by O
contrast O
. O
Nothing O
exists O
in O
itself O
. O
If O
you O
flatter O
yourself O
that O
you O
are O
all O
over O
comfortable O
, O
and O
have O
been O
so O
a O
long O
time O
, O
then O
you O
can O
not O
be O
said O
to O
be O
comfortable O
any O
more O
. O
But O
if O
, O
like O
Queequeg O
and O
me O
in O
the O
bed O
, O
the O
tip O
of O
your O
nose O
or O
the O
crown O
of O
your O
head O
be O
slightly O
chilled O
, O
why O
then O
, O
indeed O
, O
in O
the O
general O
consciousness O
, O
you O
feel O
most O
delightfully O
and O
un- O
mistakably O
warm O
. O
For O
this O
reason O
a O
sleeping O
apartment O
should O
never O
be O
furnished O
with O
a O
fire O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
the O
luxurious O
discomforts O
of O
the O
rich O
. O
For O
the O
height O
of O
this O
sort O
of O
deliciousness O
is O
to O
have O
nothing O
but O
the O
blanket O
between O
you O
and O
your O
snuggess O
, O
and O
the O
cold O
of O
the O
outer O
air O
. O
Then O
, O
there O
you O
lie O
like O
the O
one O
warm O
spark O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
an O
arctic O
crystal O
. O
We O
had O
been O
sitting O
in O
this O
crouching O
manner O
for O
some O
time O
, O
when O
all O
at O
once O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
open O
my O
eyes O
; O
for O
when O
between O
sheets O
, O
whether O
by O
day O
or O
by O
night O
, O
and O
whether O
asleep O
or O
awake O
, O
I O
have O
a O
way O
of O
always O
keeping O
my O
eyes O
shut O
, O
in O
order O
the O
more O
to O
concentrate O
the O
snuggess O
of O
being O
in O
bed O
: O
because O
no O
man O
can O
ever O
feel O
his O
own O
identity O
aright O
except O
his O
eyes O
be O
closed O
; O
as O
if O
darkness O
were O
indeed O
the O
proper O
element O
of O
our O
essences O
, O
though O
light O
be O
more O
congenial O
to O
our O
clayey O
part O
. O
Upon O
opening O
my O
eyes O
then O
, O
and O
coming O
out O
of O
my O
own O
pleasant O
and O
self-created O
darkness O
into O
the O
imposed O
and O
coarse O
outer O
gloom O
of O
the O
unilluminated O
twelve-o'clock-at-night O
, O
I O
experienced O
a O
disagreeable O
revulsion O
. O
Nor O
did O
I O
at O
all O
object O
to O
the O
hint O
from O
Queequeg O
that O
per- O
haps O
it O
were O
best O
to O
strike O
a O
light O
, O
seeing O
that O
we O
were O
so O
wide O
awake O
; O
and O
besides O
he O
felt O
a O
strong O
desire O
to O
have O
a O
few O
quiet O
puffs O
from O
his O
toma- O
hawk O
. O
Be O
it O
said O
, O
that O
though O
I O
had O
felt O
such O
a O
strong O
repugnance O
to O
his O
smoking O
in O
the O
bed O
the O
night O
before O
, O
yet O
see O
how O
elastic O
our O
stiff O
preju- O
dices O
grow O
when O
love O
once O
comes O
to O
bend O
them O
! O
For O
now O
I O
liked O
nothing O
better O
than O
to O
have O
Queequeg O
smoking O
by O
me O
, O
even O
in O
bed O
, O
because O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
full O
of O
such O
serene O
household O
joy O
then O
. O
I O
no O
more O
felt O
unduly O
concerned O
for O
the O
landlord O
's O
policy O
of O
insurance O
. O
I O
was O
only O
alive O
to O
the O
condensed O
confidential O
comfortableness O
of O
sharing O
a O
pipe O
and O
a O
blanket O
with O
a O
real O
friend O
. O
With O
our O
shaggy O
jackets O
drawn O
about O
our O
shoul- O
ders O
, O
we O
now O
passed O
the O
tomahawk O
from O
one O
to O
the O
other O
, O
till O
slowly O
there O
grew O
over O
us O
a O
blue O
hanging O
tester O
of O
smoke O
, O
illuminated O
by O
the O
flame O
of O
the O
new-lit O
lamp O
. O
Whether O
it O
was O
that O
this O
undulating O
tester O
rolled O
the O
savage O
away O
to O
far O
distant O
scenes O
, O
I O
know O
not O
, O
but O
he O
now O
spoke O
of O
his O
native O
Island O
; O
and O
, O
eager O
to O
hear O
his O
history O
, O
I O
begged O
him O
to O
go O
on O
and O
tell O
it O
. O
He O
gladly O
complied O
. O
Though O
at O
the O
time O
I O
but O
ill O
comprehended O
not O
a O
few O
of O
his O
words O
, O
yet O
subsequent O
disclosures O
, O
when O
I O
had O
become O
more O
familiar O
with O
his O
broken O
phraseology O
, O
now O
enable O
me O
to O
present O
the O
whole O
story O
, O
such O
as O
it O
may O
prove O
in O
the O
mere O
skeleton O
I O
give O
. O
