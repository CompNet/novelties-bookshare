THE O
precipitating O
manner O
in O
which O
Captain O
Ahab O
had O
quitted O
the O
Samuel O
Enderby O
of O
London O
, O
had O
not O
been O
unattended O
with O
some O
small O
violence O
to O
his O
own O
person O
. O
He O
had O
lighted O
with O
such O
energy O
upon O
a O
thwart O
of O
his O
boat O
, O
that O
his O
ivory O
leg O
had O
received O
a O
half-splintering O
shock O
. O
And O
when O
after O
gaining O
his O
own O
deck O
, O
and O
his O
own O
pivot-hole O
there O
, O
he O
so O
vehemently O
wheeled O
round O
with O
an O
urgent O
command O
to O
the O
steersman O
( O
it O
was O
, O
as O
ever O
, O
something O
about O
his O
not O
steering O
inflexibly O
enough O
) O
; O
then O
, O
the O
already O
shaken O
ivory O
received O
such O
an O
additional O
twist O
and O
wrench O
, O
that O
though O
it O
still O
remained O
entire O
, O
and O
to O
all O
appearances O
lusty O
, O
yet O
Ahab O
did O
not O
deem O
it O
entirely O
trust- O
worthy O
. O
And O
, O
indeed O
, O
it O
seemed O
small O
matter O
for O
wonder O
, O
that O
for O
all O
his O
pervading O
, O
mad O
recklessness O
, O
Ahab O
did O
at O
times O
give O
careful O
heed O
to O
the O
condition O
of O
that O
dead O
bone O
upon O
which O
he O
partly O
stood O
. O
For O
, O
it O
had O
not O
been O
very O
long O
prior O
to O
the O
Pequod O
's O
sailing O
from O
Nantucket O
, O
that O
he O
had O
been O
found O
one O
night O
lying O
prone O
upon O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
in- O
sensible O
: O
by O
some O
unknown O
, O
and O
seemingly O
in- O
explicable O
, O
unimaginable O
casualty O
, O
his O
ivory O
limb O
having O
been O
so O
violently O
displaced O
, O
that O
it O
had O
stakewise O
smitten O
, O
and O
all O
but O
pierced O
his O
groin O
; O
nor O
was O
it O
without O
extreme O
difficulty O
that O
the O
agonizing O
wound O
was O
entirely O
cured O
. O
Nor O
, O
at O
the O
time O
, O
had O
it O
failed O
to O
enter O
his O
monomaniac O
mind O
, O
that O
all O
the O
anguish O
of O
that O
then O
present O
suffering O
was O
but O
the O
direct O
issue O
of O
a O
former O
woe O
; O
and O
he O
too O
plainly O
seemed O
to O
see O
, O
that O
as O
the O
most O
poisonous O
reptile O
of O
the O
marsh O
perpetuates O
his O
kind O
as O
inevitably O
as O
the O
sweetest O
songster O
of O
the O
grove O
; O
so O
, O
equally O
with O
every O
felicity O
, O
all O
miserable O
events O
do O
naturally O
beget O
their O
like O
. O
Yea O
, O
more O
than O
equally O
, O
thought O
Ahab O
; O
since O
both O
the O
ancestry O
and O
posterity O
of O
grief O
go O
further O
than O
the O
ancestry O
and O
posterity O
of O
joy O
. O
For O
, O
not O
to O
hint O
of O
this O
: O
that O
it O
is O
an O
inference O
from O
certain O
canonical O
teachings O
, O
that O
while O
some O
natural O
enjoyments O
here O
shall O
have O
no O
children O
born O
to O
them O
for O
the O
other O
world O
, O
but O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
shall O
be O
followed O
by O
the O
joy- O
childlessness O
of O
all O
hell O
's O
despair O
; O
whereas O
, O
some O
guilty O
mortal O
miseries O
shall O
still O
fertilely O
beget O
to O
themselves O
an O
eternally O
progressive O
progeny O
of O
griefs O
beyond O
the O
grave—not O
at O
all O
to O
hint O
of O
this O
; O
there O
still O
seems O
an O
inequality O
in O
the O
deeper O
analysis O
of O
the O
thing O
. O
For O
, O
thought O
Ahab O
, O
while O
even O
the O
highest O
earthly O
felicities O
ever O
have O
a O
certain O
unsignifying O
pettiness O
lurking O
in O
them O
, O
but O
, O
at O
bottom O
, O
all O
heart-woes O
, O
a O
mystic O
signifi- O
cance O
, O
and O
, O
in O
some O
men O
, O
an O
archangelic O
gran- O
deur O
; O
so O
do O
their O
diligent O
tracings-out O
not O
belie O
the O
obvious O
deduction O
. O
To O
trail O
the O
genealogies O
of O
these O
high O
mortal O
miseries O
, O
carries O
us O
at O
last O
among O
the O
sourceless O
primogenitures O
of O
the O
gods O
; O
so O
that O
, O
in O
the O
face O
of O
all O
the O
glad O
, O
hay-making O
suns O
, O
and O
soft-cymballing O
, O
round O
harvest-moons O
, O
we O
must O
needs O
give O
in O
to O
this O
: O
that O
the O
gods O
themselves O
are O
not O
for O
ever O
glad O
. O
The O
inefface- O
able O
, O
sad O
birth-mark O
in O
the O
brow O
of O
man O
, O
is O
but O
the O
stamp O
of O
sorrow O
in O
the O
singers O
. O
Unwittingly O
here O
a O
secret O
has O
been O
divulged O
, O
which O
perhaps O
might O
more O
properly O
, O
in O
set O
way O
, O
have O
been O
disclosed O
before O
. O
With O
many O
other O
particulars O
concerning O
Ahab O
, O
always O
had O
it O
re- O
mained O
a O
mystery O
to O
some O
, O
why O
it O
was O
, O
that O
for O
a O
certain O
period O
, O
both O
before O
and O
after O
the O
sailing O
of O
the O
Pepuod O
he O
had O
hidden O
himself O
away O
with O
such O
Grand-Lama-like O
exclusiveness O
; O
and O
for O
that O
one O
interval O
, O
sought O
speechless O
refuge O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
among O
the O
marble O
senate O
of O
the O
dead O
. O
Captain O
Peleg O
's O
bruited O
reason O
for O
this O
thing O
appeared O
by O
no O
means O
adequate O
; O
though O
, O
indeed O
, O
as O
touching O
all O
Ahab O
's O
deeper O
part O
, O
every O
revela- O
tion O
partook O
more O
of O
significant O
darkness O
than O
of O
explanatory O
light O
. O
But O
, O
in O
the O
end O
, O
it O
all O
came O
out O
-this O
one O
matter O
did O
, O
at O
least O
. O
That O
direful O
mishap O
was O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
his O
temporary O
recluseness O
. O
And O
not O
only O
this O
, O
but O
to O
that O
ever-contracting O
, O
drop- O
ping O
circle O
ashore O
, O
who O
, O
for O
any O
reason O
, O
possessed O
the O
privilege O
of O
a O
less O
banned O
approach O
to O
him O
; O
to O
that O
timid O
circle O
the O
above O
hinted O
casualty- O
remaining O
, O
as O
it O
did O
, O
moodily O
unaccounted O
for O
by O
Ahab-invested O
itself O
with O
terrors O
, O
not O
en- O
tirely O
underived O
from O
the O
land O
of O
spirits O
and O
of O
wails O
. O
So O
that O
, O
through O
their O
zeal O
for O
him O
, O
they O
had O
all O
conspired O
, O
so O
far O
as O
in O
them O
lay O
, O
to O
muffle O
up O
the O
knowledge O
of O
this O
thing O
from O
others O
; O
and O
hence O
it O
was O
, O
that O
, O
not O
till O
a O
considerable O
interval O
had O
elapsed O
, O
did O
it O
transpire O
upon O
the O
Pequod O
's O
decks O
. O
But O
be O
all O
this O
as O
it O
may O
; O
let O
the O
unseen O
, O
am- O
biguous O
synod O
in O
the O
air O
, O
or O
the O
vindictive O
princes O
and O
potentates O
of O
fire O
, O
have O
to O
do O
or O
not O
with O
earthly O
Ahab O
, O
yet O
, O
in O
this O
present O
matter O
of O
his O
leg O
, O
he O
took O
plain O
practical O
procedures O
; O
—he O
called O
the O
carpenter O
. O
And O
when O
that O
functionary O
appeared O
before O
him O
, O
he O
bade O
him O
without O
delay O
set O
about O
making O
a O
new O
leg O
, O
and O
directed O
the O
mates O
to O
see O
him O
supplied O
with O
all O
the O
studs O
and O
joists O
of O
jaw- O
ivory O
( O
Sperm O
Whale O
) O
which O
had O
thus O
far O
been O
accumulated O
on O
the O
voyage O
, O
in O
order O
that O
a O
careful O
selection O
of O
the O
stoutest O
, O
clearest-grained O
stuff O
might O
be O
secured O
. O
This O
done O
, O
the O
carpenter O
received O
orders O
to O
have O
the O
leg O
completed O
that O
night O
; O
and O
to O
provide O
all O
the O
fittings O
for O
it O
, O
inde- O
pendent O
of O
those O
pertaining O
to O
the O
distrusted O
one O
in O
use O
. O
Moreover O
, O
the O
ship O
's O
forge O
was O
ordered O
to O
be O
hoisted O
out O
of O
its O
temporary O
idleness O
in O
the O
hold O
; O
and O
, O
to O
accelerate O
the O
affair O
, O
the O
blacksmith O
was O
commanded O
to O
proceed O
at O
once O
to O
the O
forging O
of O
whatever O
iron O
contrivances O
might O
be O
needed O
. O
