As O

at O

Golden O
Inn O

THE O
Cape O
of O
Good O
Hope O
, O
and O
all O
the O
watery O
region O
round O
about O
there O
, O
is O
much O
like O
some O
noted O
four O
corners O
of O
a O
great O
highway O
, O
where O
you O
meet O
more O
travellers O
than O
in O
any O
other O
part O
. O
It O
was O
not O
very O
long O
after O
speaking O
the O
Goney O
that O
another O
homeward-bound O
whaleman O
, O
the O
Toven-Ho O
, O
* O
was O
encountered O
, O
She O
was O
manned O
almost O
wholly O
by O
Polynesians O
. O
In O
the O
short O
gam O
that O
ensued O
she O
gave O
us O
strong O
news O
of O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
To O
some O
the O
general O
interest O
in O
the O
White O
Whale O
was O
now O
wildly O
heightened O
by O
a O
circum- O
stance O
of O
the O
Toven-Ho O
's O
story O
, O
which O
seemed O
obscurely O
to O
involve O
with O
the O
whale O
a O
certain O
wondrous O
, O
inverted O
visitation O
of O
one O
of O
those O
so- O
called O
judgments O
of O
God O
which O
at O
times O
are O
said O
to O
overtake O
some O
men O
. O
This O
latter O
circumstance O
, O
with O
its O
own O
peculiar O
accompaniments O
, O
forming O
what O
may O
be O
called O
the O
secret O
part O
of O
the O
tragedy O
about O
to O
be O
narrated O
, O
never O
reached O
the O
ears O
of O
* O
The O
ancient O
whale-cry O
upon O
first O
sighting O
a O
whale O
from O
the O
mast-head O
, O
still O
used O
by O
whalemen O
in O
hunting O
the O
famous O
Galli- O
pagos O
terrapin O
. O
Captain O
Ahab O
or O
his O
mates O
. O
For O
that O
secret O
part O
of O
the O
story O
was O
unknown O
to O
the O
captain O
of O
the O
Town-Ho O
himself O
. O
It O
was O
the O
private O
property O
of O
three O
confederate O
white O
seamen O
of O
that O
ship O
, O
one O
of O
whom O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
communicated O
it O
to O
Tash- O
tego O
with O
Romish O
injunctions O
of O
secrecy O
; O
but O
the O
following O
night O
Tashtego O
rambled O
in O
his O
sleep O
, O
and O
revealed O
so O
much O
of O
it O
in O
that O
way O
, O
that O
when O
he O
was O
wakened O
he O
could O
not O
well O
withhold O
the O
rest O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
so O
potent O
an O
influence O
did O
this O
thing O
have O
on O
those O
seamen O
in O
the O
Pequod O
who O
came O
to O
the O
full O
knowledge O
of O
it O
, O
and O
by O
such O
a O
strange O
delicacy-to O
call O
it O
so-were O
they O
go- O
verned O
in O
this O
matter O
, O
that O
they O
kept O
the O
secret O
among O
themselves O
, O
so O
that O
it O
never O
transpired O
abaft O
the O
Pequod O
's O
main-mast O
. O
Interweaving O
in O
its O
proper O
place O
this O
darker O
thread O
with O
the O
story O
, O
as O
publicly O
narrated O
on O
the O
ship O
, O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
strange O
affair O
I O
now O
proceed O
to O
put O
on O
lasting O
record O
. O
For O
my O
humour O
's O
sake O
, O
I O
shall O
preserve O
the O
style O
in O
which O
I O
once O
narrated O
it O
at O
Lima O
to O
a O
lounging O
circle O
of O
my O
Spanish O
friends O
, O
one O
saint O
's O
eve O
, O
smoking O
upon O
the O
thick-gilt O
tiled O
piazza O
of O
the O
Golden O
Inn O
. O
Of O
those O
fine O
cavaliers O
, O
the O
young O
Dons O
, O
Pedro O
and O
Sebastian O
, O
were O
on O
the O
closer O
terms O
with O
me O
; O
and O
hence O
the O
interluding O
questions O
they O
occasionally O
put O
, O
and O
which O
are O
duly O
answered O
at O
the O
time O
. O
" O
Some O
two O
years O
prior O
to O
my O
first O
learning O
the O
events O
which O
I O
am O
about O
rehearsing O
to O
you O
, O
gentle- O
men O
, O
the O
Town-Ho O
, O
Sperm O
Whaler O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
was O
cruising O
in O
your O
Pacific O
here O
, O
not O
very O
many O
days O
' O
sail O
eastward O
from O
the O
eaves O
of O
this O
good O
Golden O
Inn O
. O
She O
was O
somewhere O
to O
the O
north- O
ward O
of O
the O
Line O
. O
One O
morning O
, O
upon O
handling O
the O
pumps O
, O
according O
to O
daily O
usage O
, O
it O
was O
ob- O
served O
that O
she O
made O
more O
water O
in O
her O
hold O
than O
common O
. O
They O
supposed O
a O
sword-fish O
had O
stabbed O
her O
, O
gentlemen O
. O
But O
the O
captain O
, O
having O
some O
unusual O
reason O
for O
believing O
that O
rare O
good O
luck O
awaited O
him O
in O
those O
latitudes O
, O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
being O
very O
averse O
to O
quit O
them O
; O
and O
the O
leak O
not O
being O
then O
considered O
at O
all O
dangerous-though O
, O
indeed O
, O
they O
could O
not O
find O
it O
after O
searching O
the O
hold O
as O
low O
down O
as O
was O
possible O
in O
rather O
heavy O
weather-the O
ship O
still O
continued O
her O
cruisings O
, O
the O
mariners O
working O
at O
the O
pumps O
at O
wide O
and O
easy O
intervals O
; O
but O
no O
good O
luck O
came O
: O
more O
days O
went O
by O
, O
and O
not O
only O
was O
the O
leak O
yet O
un- O
discovered O
, O
but O
it O
sensibly O
increased O
; O
so O
much O
so O
, O
that O
now O
taking O
some O
alarm O
, O
the O
captain O
, O
making O
all O
sail O
, O
stood O
away O
for O
the O
nearest O
harbour O
among O
the O
islands O
, O
there O
to O
have O
his O
hull O
hove O
out O
and O
repaired O
. O
" O
Though O
no O
small O
passage O
was O
before O
her O
, O
yet O
, O
if O
the O
commonest O
chance O
favoured O
, O
he O
did O
not O
at O
all O
fear O
that O
his O
ship O
would O
founder O
by O
the O
way O
, O
because O
his O
pumps O
were O
of O
the O
best O
, O
and O
being O
periodically O
relieved O
at O
them O
, O
those O
six-and-thirty O
men O
of O
his O
could O
easily O
keep O
the O
ship O
free O
: O
never O
mind O
if O
the O
leak O
should O
double O
on O
her O
. O
In O
truth O
, O
well O
nigh O
the O
whole O
of O
this O
passage O
being O
attended O
by O
very O
prosperous O
breezes O
, O
the O
Town-Ho O
had O
all O
but O
certainly O
arrived O
in O
perfect O
safety O
at O
her O
port O
, O
without O
the O
occurrence O
of O
the O
least O
fatality O
, O
had O
it O
not O
been O
for O
the O
brutal O
overbearing O
of O
Radney O
, O
the O
mate O
, O
a O
Vineyarder O
, O
and O
the O
bitterly-provoked O
vengeance O
of O
Steelkilt O
, O
a O
Lakeman O
and O
desperado O
from O
Buffalo O
. O
" O
Lakeman O
! O
Buffalo O
! O
Pray O
, O
what O
is O
a O
Lake- O
man O
, O
and O
where O
is O
Buffalo O
? O
said O
Don O
Sebastian O
, O
rising O
in O
his O
swinging O
mat O
of O
grass O
. O
" O
On O
the O
eastern O
shore O
of O
our O
Lake O
Erie O
, O
Don O
; O
but-I O
crave O
your O
courtesy-may O
be O
, O
you O
shall O
soon O
hear O
further O
of O
all O
that O
. O
Now O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
in O
square-sail O
brigs O
and O
three-masted O
ships O
, O
well O
nigh O
as O
large O
and O
stout O
as O
any O
that O
ever O
sailed O
out O
of O
your O
old O
Callao O
to O
far O
Manilla O
; O
this O
Lakeman O
, O
in O
the O
land-locked O
heart O
of O
our O
America O
, O
had O
yet O
been O
nurtured O
by O
all O
those O
agrarian O
freebooting O
impressions O
popularly O
connected O
with O
the O
open O
ocean O
. O
For O
in O
their O
interflowing O
aggregate O
, O
those O
grand O
fresh-water O
seas O
of O
ours O
, O
-Erie O
, O
and O
On- O
tario O
, O
and O
Huron O
, O
and O
Superior O
, O
and O
Michigan O
, O
- O
possess O
an O
ocean-like O
expansiveness O
, O
with O
many O
of O
the O
ocean O
's O
noblest O
traits O
; O
with O
many O
of O
its O
rimmed O
varieties O
of O
races O
and O
of O
climes O
. O
They O
contain O
round O
archipelagos O
of O
romantic O
isles O
, O
even O
as O
the O
Polynesian O
waters O
do O
; O
in O
large O
part O
, O
are O
shored O
by O
two O
great O
contrasting O
nations O
, O
as O
the O
Atlantic O
is O
; O
they O
furnish O
long O
maritime O
approaches O
to O
our O
numerous O
territorial O
colonies O
from O
the O
East O
, O
dotted O
all O
round O
their O
banks O
; O
here O
and O
there O
are O
frowned O
upon O
by O
batteries O
, O
and O
by O
the O
goat-like O
craggy O
guns O
of O
lofty O
Mackinaw O
; O
they O
have O
heard O
the O
fleet O
thundering O
of O
naval O
victories O
; O
at O
intervals O
they O
yield O
their O
beaches O
to O
wild O
barbarians O
, O
whose O
red O
painted O
faces O
flash O
from O
out O
their O
peltry O
wig- O
wams O
; O
for O
leagues O
and O
leagues O
are O
flanked O
by O
ancient O
and O
unentered O
forests O
, O
where O
the O
gaunt O
pines O
stand O
like O
serried O
lines O
of O
kings O
in O
Gothic O
genealogies O
; O
those O
same O
woods O
harbouring O
wild O
Afric O
beasts O
of O
prey O
, O
and O
silken O
creatures O
whose O
exported O
furs O
give O
robes O
to O
Tartar O
emperors O
. O
They O
mirror O
the O
paved O
capitals O
of O
Buffalo O
and O
Cleveland O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Winnebago O
villages O
; O
they O
float O
alike O
the O
full-rigged-merchant O
ship O
, O
the O
armed O
cruiser O
of O
the O
State O
, O
the O
steamer O
, O
and O
the O
beech O
canoe O
; O
they O
are O
swept O
by O
Borean O
and O
dismasting O
blasts O
, O
as O
direful O
as O
any O
that O
lash O
the O
salted O
wave O
; O
they O
know O
what O
shipwrecks O
are O
, O
for O
out O
of O
sight O
of O
land O
, O
however O
inland O
, O
they O
have O
drowned O
full O
many O
a O
midnight O
ship O
with O
all O
its O
shrieking O
crew O
. O
" O
Thus O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
though O
an O
inlander O
, O
Steel- O
kilt O
was O
wild-ocean O
born O
, O
and O
wild-ocean O
nur- O
tured O
; O
as O
much O
of O
an O
audacious O
mariner O
as O
any O
. O
And O
for O
Radney O
, O
though O
in O
his O
infancy O
he O
may O
have O
laid O
him O
down O
on O
the O
lone O
Nantucket O
beach O
, O
to O
nurse O
at O
his O
maternal O
sea O
; O
though O
in O
after-life O
he O
had O
long O
followed O
our O
austere O
Atlantic O
and O
your O
contemplative O
Pacific O
; O
still O
was O
he O
quite O
as O
vengeful O
and O
full O
of O
social O
quarrel O
as O
the O
backwoods O
seaman O
, O
fresh O
from O
the O
latitudes O
of O
buck-horn-handled O
bowie-knives O
. O
Yet O
was O
this O
Nantucketer O
a O
man O
with O
some O
good-hearted O
traits O
; O
and O
this O
Lakeman O
, O
a O
mariner O
, O
who-though O
a O
sort O
of O
devil O
indeed-might O
yet O
by O
inflexible O
firmness O
, O
only O
tempered O
by O
that O
common O
decency O
of O
human O
recognition O
which O
is O
the O
meanest O
slave O
's O
right O
; O
thus O
treated O
, O
this O
Steelkilt O
had O
long O
been O
retained O
harmless O
and O
docile O
. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
he O
had O
proved O
so O
thus O
far O
; O
but O
Radney O
was O
doomed O
and O
made O
mad O
, O
and O
Steelkilt-but O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
you O
shall O
hear O
. O
" O
It O
was O
not O
more O
than O
a O
day O
or O
two O
at O
the O
furthest O
after O
pointing O
her O
prow O
for O
her O
island O
haven O
, O
that O
the O
Town-Ho O
's O
leak O
seemed O
again O
increasing O
, O
but O
only O
so O
as O
to O
require O
an O
hour O
or O
more O
at O
the O
pumps O
every O
day O
. O
You O
must O
know O
that O
in O
a O
settled O
and O
civilized O
ocean-like O
our O
Atlantic O
, O
for O
example-some O
skippers O
think O
little O
of O
pumping O
their O
whole O
way O
across O
it O
; O
though O
of O
a O
still O
, O
sleepy O
night O
, O
should O
the O
officer O
of O
the O
deck O
happen O
to O
forget O
his O
duty O
in O
that O
respect O
, O
the O
pro- O
bability O
would O
be O
that O
he O
and O
his O
shipmates O
would O
never O
again O
remember O
it O
, O
on O
account O
of O
all O
hands O
gently O
subsiding O
to O
the O
bottom O
. O
Nor O
in O
the O
soli- O
tary O
and O
savage O
seas O
, O
far O
from O
you O
to O
the O
west- O
ward O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
is O
it O
altogether O
unusual O
for O
ships O
to O
keep O
clanging O
at O
their O
pump-handles O
in O
full O
chorus O
, O
even O
for O
a O
voyage O
of O
considerable O
length O
; O
that O
is O
, O
if O
it O
lie O
along O
a O
tolerably O
accessible O
coast O
, O
or O
if O
any O
other O
reasonable O
retreat O
is O
afforded O
them O
. O
It O
is O
only O
when O
a O
leaky O
vessel O
is O
in O
some O
very O
out O
of O
the O
way O
part O
of O
those O
waters O
, O
some O
really O
land- O
less O
latitude O
, O
that O
her O
captain O
begins O
to O
feel O
a O
little O
anxious O
. O
" O
Much O
this O
way O
had O
it O
been O
with O
the O
Town- O
Ho O
; O
so O
when O
her O
leak O
was O
found O
gaining O
once O
more O
, O
there O
was O
in O
truth O
some O
small O
concern O
manifested O
by O
several O
of O
her O
company O
; O
especially O
by O
Radney O
the O
mate O
. O
He O
commanded O
the O
upper O
sails O
to O
be O
well O
hoisted O
, O
sheeted O
home O
anew O
, O
and O
every O
way O
expanded O
to O
the O
breeze O
. O
Now O
this O
Radney O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
was O
as O
little O
of O
a O
coward O
, O
and O
as O
little O
inclined O
to O
any O
sort O
of O
nervous O
apprehension O
siveness O
touching O
his O
own O
person O
, O
as O
any O
fearless O
, O
unthinking O
creature O
on O
land O
or O
on O
sea O
that O
you O
can O
conveniently O
imagine O
, O
gentlemen O
. O
Therefore O
, O
when O
he O
betrayed O
this O
solicitude O
about O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
some O
of O
the O
seamen O
declared O
that O
it O
was O
only O
on O
account O
of O
his O
being O
a O
part O
owner O
in O
her O
. O
So O
when O
they O
were O
working O
that O
evening O
at O
the O
pumps O
, O
there O
was O
on O
this O
head O
no O
small O
gamesomeness O
slily O
going O
on O
among O
them O
, O
as O
they O
stood O
with O
their O
feet O
continually O
overflowed O
by O
the O
rippling O
clear O
water-clear O
as O
any O
mountain O
spring O
, O
gentlemen-that O
bubbling O
from O
the O
pumps O
ran O
across O
the O
deck O
, O
and O
poured O
itself O
out O
in O
steady O
spouts O
at O
the O
lee O
scupper-holes O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
as O
you O
well O
know O
, O
it O
is O
not O
seldom O
the O
case O
in O
this O
conventional O
world O
of O
ours-watery O
or O
otherwise O
, O
that O
when O
a O
person O
placed O
in O
com- O
mand O
over O
his O
fellow-men O
finds O
one O
of O
them O
to O
be O
very O
significantly O
his O
superior O
in O
general O
pride O
of O
manhood O
, O
straightway O
against O
that O
man O
he O
con- O
ceives O
an O
unconquerable O
dislike O
and O
bitterness O
; O
and O
if O
he O
have O
a O
chance O
, O
he O
will O
pull O
down O
and O
pulverize O
that O
subaltern O
's O
tower O
, O
and O
make O
a O
little O
heap O
of O
dust O
of O

Be O
this O

, O
gentlemen O
, O
at O
all O
events O
Steelkilt O
was O
a O
tall O
and O
noble O
animal O
, O
with O
a O
head O
like O
a O
Roman O
, O
and O
a O
flowing O
golden O
beard O
like O
the O
tasselled O
housings O
of O
your O
last O
viceroy O
's O
snorting O
charger O
; O
and O
a O
brain O
, O
and O
a O
heart O
, O
and O
a O
soul O
in O
him O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
which O
had O
made O
Steelkilt O
Charlemagne O
, O
had O
he O
been O
born O
son O
to O
Charlemagne O
's O
father O
. O
But O
Radney O
, O
the O
mate O
, O
was O
ugly O
as O
a O
mule O
; O
yet O
as O
hardy O
, O
as O
stubborn O
, O
as O
malicious O
. O
He O
did O
not O
love O
Steelkilt O
, O
and O
Steelkilt O
knew O
it O
. O
" O
Espying O
the O
mate O
drawing O
near O
as O
he O
was O
toiling O
at O
the O
pump O
with O
the O
rest O
, O
the O
Lakeman O
affected O
not O
to O
notice O
him O
, O
but O
unwaved O
, O
went O
on O
with O
his O
gay O
banterings O
. O
" O
' O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
my O
merry O
lads O
, O
it O
's O
a O
lively O
leak O
this O
; O
hold O
a O
cannikin O
, O
one O
of O
ye O
, O
and O
let O
's O
have O
a O
taste O
. O
By O
the O
Lord O
, O
it O
's O
worth O
bottling O
! O
I O
tell O
ye O
what O
, O
men O
, O
old O
Rad O
's O
investment O
must O
go O
for O
it O
! O
he O
had O
best O
cut O
away O
his O
part O
of O
the O
hull O
, O
and O
tow O
it O
home O
. O
The O
fact O
is O
, O
boys O
, O
that O
sword-fish O
only O
began O
the O
job O
; O
he O
's O
come O
back O
again O
with O
a O
gang O
of O
ship-carpenters O
, O
saw-fish O
, O
and O
file-fish O
, O
and O
what O
not O
; O
and O
the O
whole O
posse O
of O
'em O
are O
now O
hard O
at O
work O
, O
cutting O
and O
slashing O
at O
the O
bottom- O
making O
improvements O
, O
I O
suppose O
. O
If O
old O
Rad O
were O
here O
now O
, O
I O
'd O
tell O
him O
to O
jump O
overboard O
and O
scatter O
'em O
. O
They O
're O
playing O
the O
devil O
with O
his O
estate O
, O
I O
can O
tell O
him O
. O
But O
he O
's O
a O
simple O
old O
soul O
, O
-Rad-and O
a O
beauty O
too O
. O
Boys O
, O
they O
say O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
property O
is O
invested O
in O
looking- O
glasses O
. O
I O
wonder O
if O
he O
'd O
give O
a O
poor O
devil O
like O
me O
the O
model O
of O
his O
nose O
. O
' O
" O
' O
D- O
your O
eyes O
! O
what O
's O
that O
pump O
stopping O
for O
? O
' O
roared O
Radney O
, O
pretending O
not O
to O
have O
heard O
the O
sailors O
' O
talk O
. O
' O
Thunder O
away O
at O
it O
! O
' O
" O
' O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
sir O
, O
' O
said O
Steellkit O
, O
merry O
as O
a O
cricket O
. O
' O
Lively O
, O
boys O
, O
lively O
now O
! O
' O
And O
with O
that O
the O
pump O
clanged O
like O
fifty O
fire-engines O
; O
the O
men O
tossed O
their O
hats O
off O
to O
it O
, O
and O
ere O
long O
that O
peculiar O
gasping O
of O
the O
lungs O
was O
heard O
which O
de- O
notes O
the O
fullest O
tension O
of O
life O
's O
utmost O
energies O
. O
" O
Quitting O
the O
pump O
at O
last O
, O
with O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
band O
, O
the O
Lakeman O
went O
forward O
all O
panting O
, O
and O
sat O
himself O
down O
on O
the O
windlass O
; O
his O
face O
fiery O
red O
, O
his O
eyes O
bloodshot O
, O
and O
wiping O
the O
pro- O
fuse O
sweat O
from O
his O
brow O
. O
Now O
, O
what O
cozening O
fiend O
it O
was O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
that O
possessed O
Radney O
to O
meddle O
with O
such O
a O
man O
in O
that O
corporeally O
exas- O
perated O
state O
, O
I O
know O
not O
: O
but O
so O
it O
happened O
. O
Intolerably O
striding O
along O
the O
deck O
, O
the O
mate O
com- O
manded O
him O
to O
get O
a O
broom O
and O
sweep O
down O
the O
planks O
, O
and O
also O
a O
shovel O
, O
and O
remove O
some O
offen- O
sive O
matters O
consequent O
upon O
allowing O
a O
pig O
to O
run O
at O
large O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
sweeping O
a O
ship O
's O
deck O
at O
sea O
is O
a O
piece O
of O
household O
work O
which O
in O
all O
times O
but O
raging O
gales O
is O
regularly O
attended O
to O
every O
evening O
: O
it O
has O
been O
known O
to O
be O
done O
in O
the O
case O
of O
ships O
actually O
foundering O
at O
the O
time O
. O
Such O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
is O
the O
inflexibility O
of O
sea-usages O
and O
the O
instinctive O
love O
of O
neatness O
in O
seamen O
, O
some O
of O
whom O
would O
not O
willingly O
drown O
without O
first O
washing O
their O
faces O
. O
But O
in O
all O
vessels O
this O
broom O
business O
is O
the O
prescriptive O
province O
of O
the O
boys O
, O
if O
boys O
there O
be O
aboard O
. O
Besides O
, O
it O
was O
the O
stronger O
men O
in O
the O
Town-Ho O
that O
had O
been O
divided O
into O
gangs O
, O
taking O
turns O
at O
the O
pumps O
; O
and O
being O
the O
most O
athletic O
seaman O
of O
them O
all O
, O
Steelkilt O
had O
been O
regularly O
assigned O
captain O
of O
one O
of O
the O
gangs O
; O
consequently O
he O
should O
have O
been O
freed O
from O
any O
trivial O
business O
not O
connected O
with O
truly O
nautical O
duties O
, O
such O
being O
the O
case O
with O
his O
comrades O
. O
I O
mention O
all O
these O
particulars O
so O
that O
you O
may O
understand O
exactly O
how O
this O
affair O
stood O
between O
the O
two O
men O
. O
" O
But O
there O
was O
more O
than O
this O
: O
the O
order O
about O
the O
shovel O
was O
almost O
as O
plainly O
meant O
to O
sting O
and O
insult O
Steelkilt O
, O
as O
though O
Radney O
had O
spat O
in O
his O
face O
. O
Any O
man O
who O
has O
gone O
sailor O
in O
a O
whale-ship O
will O
understand O
this O
; O
and O
all O
this O
, O
and O
doubtless O
much O
more O
, O
the O
Lakeman O
fully O
comprehended O
when O
the O
mate O
uttered O
his O
com- O
mand O
. O
But O
as O
he O
sat O
still O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
as O
he O
steadfastly O
looked O
into O
the O
mate O
's O
malignant O
eye O
and O
perceived O
the O
stacks O
of O
powder-casks O
heaped O
up O
in O
him O
, O
and O
the O
slow-match O
silently O
burning O
along O
towards O
them O
; O
as O
he O
instinctively O
saw O
all O
this O
, O
that O
strange O
forbearance O
and O
unwil- O
lingness O
to O
stir O
up O
the O
deeper O
passionateness O
in O
any O
already O
ireful O
being-a O
repugnance O
most O
felt O
, O
when O
felt O
at O
all O
, O
by O
really O
valiant O
men O
, O
even O
when O
aggrieved-this O
nameless O
phantom O
feeling O
, O
gentle- O
men O
, O
stole O
over O
Steelkilt O
. O
" O
Therefore O
, O
in O
his O
ordinary O
tone O
, O
only O
a O
little O
broken O
by O
the O
bodily O
exhaustion O
he O
was O
tempo- O
rarily O
in O
, O
he O
answered O
him O
, O
saying O
that O
sweeping O
the O
deck O
was O
not O
his O
business O
, O
and O
he O
would O
not O
do O
it O
. O
And O
then O
, O
without O
at O
all O
alluding O
to O
the O
shovel O
, O
he O
pointed O
to O
three O
lads O
as O
the O
customary O
sweepers O
; O
who O
, O
not O
being O
billeted O
at O
the O
pumps O
, O
had O
done O
little O
or O
nothing O
all O
day O
. O
To O
this O
, O
Radney O
replied O
with O
an O
oath O
, O
in O
a O
most O
domineer- O
ing O
and O
outrageous O
manner O
unconditionally O
reite- O
rating O
his O
command O
; O
meanwhile O
advancing O
upon O
the O
still O
seated O
Lakeman O
, O
with O
an O
uplifted O
cooper O
's O
club O
hammer O
, O
which O
he O
had O
snatched O
from O
a O
cask O
near O
by O
. O
" O
Heated O
and O
irritated O
as O
he O
was O
by O
his O
spas- O
modic O
toil O
at O
the O
pumps O
, O
for O
all O
his O
first O
nameless O
feeling O
of O
forbearance O
the O
sweating O
Steelkilt O
could O
ill O
brook O
this O
bearing O
in O
the O
mate O
; O
but O
somehow O
still O
smothering O
the O
conflagration O
within O
him O
, O
without O
speaking O
he O
remained O
doggedly O
rooted O
to O
his O
seat O
, O
till O
at O
last O
the O
incensed O
Radney O
shook O
the O
hammer O
within O
a O
few O
inches O
of O
his O
face O
, O
furiously O
commanding O
him O
to O
do O
his O
bidding O
. O
" O
Steelkilt O
arose O
, O
and O
slowly O
retreating O
round O
the O
windlass O
, O
steadily O
followed O
by O
the O
mate O
with O
his O
menacing O
hammer O
, O
deliberately O
repeated O
his O
intention O
not O
to O
obey O
. O
Seeing O
, O
however O
, O
that O
his O
forbearance O
had O
not O
the O
slightest O
effect O
, O
by O
an O
awful O
and O
unspeakable O
intimation O
with O
his O
twisted O
hand O
he O
warned O
off O
the O
foolish O
and O
infatuated O
man O
-but O
it O
was O
to O
no O
purpose O
. O
And O
in O
this O
way O
the O
two O
went O
once O
slowly O
round O
the O
windlass O
; O
when O
, O
resolved O
at O
last O
no O
longer O
to O
retreat O
, O
bethinking O
him O
that O
he O
had O
now O
forborne O
as O
much O
as O
com- O
ported O
with O
his O
humour O
, O
the O
Lakeman O
paused O
on O
the O
hatches O
, O
and O
thus O
spoke O
to O
the O
officer O
: O
-- O
" O
' O
Mr. O
Radney O
, O
I O
will O
not O
obey O
you O
. O
Take O
that O
hammer O
away O
, O
or O
look O
to O
yourself O
. O
' O
But O
the O
predestinated O
mate O
coming O
still O
closer O
to O
him O
, O
where O
the O
Lakeman O
stood O
fixed O
, O
now O
shook O
the O
heavy O
hammer O
within O
an O
inch O
of O
his O
teeth O
; O
meanwhile O
repeating O
a O
string O
of O
insufferable O
maledictions O
. O
Retreating O
not O
the O
thousandth O
part O
of O
an O
inch O
; O
stabbing O
him O
in O
the O
eye O
with O
the O
unflinching O
poniard O
of O
his O
glance O
, O
Steelkilt O
, O
clenching O
his O
right O
hand O
behind O
him O
and O
creepingly O
drawing O
it O
back O
, O
told O
his O
persecutor O
that O
if O
the O
hammer O
but O
grazed O
his O
cheek O
he O
( O
Steelkilt O
) O
would O
murder O
him O
. O
But O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
the O
fool O
had O
been O
branded O
for O
the O
slaughter O
by O
the O
gods O
. O
Immediately O
the O
hammer O
touched O
the O
cheek O
; O
the O
next O
instant O
the O
lower O
jaw O
of O
the O
mate O
was O
stove O
in O
his O
head O
: O
he O
fell O
on O
the O
hatch O
spouting O
blood O
like O
a O
whale O
. O
" O
Ere O
the O
cry O
could O
go O
aft O
, O
Steelkilt O
was O
shaking O
one O
of O
the O
backstays O
leading O
far O
aloft O
to O
where O
two O
of O
his O
comrades O
were O
standing O
their O
mast- O
heads O
. O
They O
were O
both O
Canallers O
. O
" O
' O
Canallers O

cried O
Don O
Pedro O

' O

for O
such O

side-light O
upon O
my O

For O
three O
hundred O

sixty O
miles O

through O
the O
entire O

of O
the O

of O

and O
days O
along O
his O
green-turfed O
, O
flowery O
Nile O
, O
he O
indolently O
floats O
, O
openly O
toying O
with O
his O
red-cheeked O
Cleo- O
patra O
upon O
the O
sunny O
deck O
. O
But O
ashore O
, O
all O
this O
effeminacy O
is O
dashed O
. O
The O
brigandish O
guise O
which O
the O
Canaller O
so O
proudly O
sports O
; O
his O
slouched O
and O
gaily-ribboned O
hat O
, O
betoken O
his O
grand O
features O
. O
A O
terror O
to O
the O
smiling O
innocence O
of O
the O
villages O
through O
which O
he O
floats O
; O
his O
swart O
visage O
and O
bold O
swagger O
are O
not O
unshunned O
in O
cities O
. O
Once O
a O
vagabond O
on O
his O
own O
canal O
, O
I O
have O
received O
good O
turns O
from O
one O
of O
these O
Canallers O
: O
I O
thank O
him O
heartily O
; O
would O
fain O
be O
not O
ungrateful O
; O
but O
it O
is O
often O
one O
of O
the O
prime O
redeeming O
qualities O
of O
your O
man O
of O
violence O
, O
that O
at O
times O
he O
has O
as O
stiff O
an O
arm O
to O
back O
a O
poor O
stranger O
in O
a O
strait O
, O
as O
to O
plunder O
a O
wealthy O
one O
. O
In O
sum O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
what O
the O
wildness O
of O
this O
canal O
life O
is O
, O
is O
emphati- O
cally O
evinced O
by O
this O
; O
that O
our O
wild O
whale-fishery O
contains O
so O
many O
of O
its O
most O
finished O
graduates O
, O
and O
that O
scarcely O
any O
race O
of O
mankind O
, O
except O
Sydney O
men O
, O
are O
so O
much O
distrusted O
by O
our O
whaling O
captains O
. O
Nor O
does O
it O
at O
all O
diminish O
the O
curiousness O
of O
this O
matter O
, O
that O
to O
many O
thousands O
of O
our O
rural O
boys O
and O
young O
men O
born O
along O
its O
line O
, O
the O
probationary O
life O
of O
the O
Grand O
Canal O
furnishes O
the O
sole O
transition O
between O
quietly O
reaping O
in O
a O
Christian O
corn-field O
, O
and O
recklessly O
ploughing O
the O
waters O
of O
the O
most O
barbaric O
seas O
. O
" O
I O
see O
! O
I O
see O
! O
" O
impetuously O
exclaimed O
Don O
Pedro O
, O
spilling O
his O
chicha O
upon O
his O
silvery O
ruffles O
. O
No O
need O
to O
travel O
! O
The O
world O
's O
one O
Lima O
. O
I O
had O
thought O
, O
now O
, O
that O
at O
your O
temperate O
North O
the O
generations O
were O
cold O
and O
holy O
as O
the O
hills.— O
But O
the O
story O
. O
' O
" O
I O
left O
off O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
where O
the O
Lakeman O
shook O
the O
backstay O
. O
Hardly O
had O
he O
done O
so O
, O
when O
he O
was O
surrounded O
by O
the O
three O
junior O
mates O
and O
the O
four O
harpooneers O
, O
who O
all O
crowded O
him O
to O
the O
deck O
. O
But O
sliding O
down O
the O
ropes O
like O
baleful O
comets O
, O
the O
two O
Canallers O
rushed O
into O
the O
uproar O
, O
and O
sought O
to O
drag O
their O
man O
out O
of O
it O
towards O
the O
forecastle O
. O
Others O
of O
the O
sailors O
joined O
with O
them O
in O
this O
attempt O
, O
and O
a O
twisted O
turmoil O
ensued O
; O
while O
standing O
out O
of O
harm O
's O
way O
, O
the O
valiant O
captain O
danced O
up O
and O
down O
with O
a O
whale-pike O
, O
calling O
upon O
his O
officers O
to O
man-handle O
that O
atrocious O
scoundrel O
, O
and O
smoke O
him O
along O
to O
the O
quarter-deck O
. O
At O
intervals O
, O
he O
ran O
close O
up O
to O
the O
revolving O
border O
of O
the O
confusion O
, O
and O
prying O
into O
the O
heart O
of O
it O
with O
his O
pike O
, O
sought O
to O
prick O
out O
the O
object O
of O
his O
resent- O
ment O
. O
But O
Steelkilt O
and O
his O
desperadoes O
were O
too O
much O
for O
them O
all O
; O
they O
succeeded O
in O
gaining O
the O
forecastle O
deck O
, O
where O
, O
hastily O
slewing O
about O
three O
or O
four O
large O
casks O
in O
a O
line O
with O
the O
wind- O
lass O
, O
these O
sea-Parisians O
entrenched O
themselves O
behind O
the O
barricade O
. O
" O
Come O
out O
of O
that O
, O
ye O
pirates O
! O
' O
roared O
the O
captain O
, O
now O
menacing O
them O
with O
a O
pistol O
in O
each O
hand O
, O
just O
brought O
to O
him O
by O
the O
steward O
. O
'Come O
out O
of O
that O
, O
ye O
cut-throats O
! O
' O
" O
Steelkil O
taken O
on O
the O
barricade O
, O
and O
striding O
up O
and O
down O
there O
, O
defied O
the O
worst O
the O
pistols O
could O
do O
; O
but O
gave O
the O
captain O
to O
understand O
distinctly O
, O
that O
his O
( O
Steelkilt O
's O
) O
death O
would O
be O
the O
signal O
for O
a O
murderous O
mutiny O
on O
the O
part O
of O
all O
hands O
. O
Fearing O
in O
his O
heart O
lest O
this O
might O
prove O
but O
too O
true O
, O
the O
captain O
a O
little O
desisted O
, O
but O
still O
commanded O
the O
insurgents O
instantly O
to O
return O
to O
their O
duty O
. O
" O
Will O
you O
promise O
not O
to O
touch O
us O
, O
if O
we O
do O
? O
demanded O
their O
ringleader O
. O
" O
Turn O
to O
! O
turn O
to O
! O
I O
make O
no O
promise O
to O
your O
duty O
. O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
sink O
the O
ship O
, O
by O
knocking O
off O
at O
a O
time O
like O
this O
? O
Turn O
to O
! O
and O
he O
once O
more O
raised O
a O
pistol O
. O
" O
Sink O
the O
ship O
? O
cried O
Steelkilt O
. O
Aye O
, O
let O
her O
sink O
. O
Not O
a O
man O
of O
us O
turns O
to O
, O
unless O
you O
swear O
not O
to O
raise O
a O
rope-yarn O
against O
us O
. O
What O
say O
ye O
, O
men O
? O
" O
turning O
to O
his O
comrades O
. O
A O
fierce O
cheer O
was O
their O
response O
. O
" O
The O
Lakeman O
now O
patrolled O
the O
barricade O
, O
all O
the O
while O
keeping O
his O
eye O
on O
the O
captain O
, O
and O
jerking O
out O
such O
sentences O
as O
these O
: O
It O
's O
not O
our O
fault O
; O
we O
did O
n't O
want O
it O
; O
I O
told O
him O
to O
take O
his O
hammer O
away O
; O
it O
was O
boys O
' O
business O
; O
he O
might O
have O
known O
me O
before O
this O
; O
I O
told O
him O
not O
to O
prick O
the O
buffalo O
; O
I O
believe O
I O
have O
broken O
a O
finger O
here O
against O
his O
cursed O
jaw O
; O
ai O

those O
mincing O
knives O
down O
in O
the O
forecastle O
there O

men O
? O
look O
to O
those O
handspikes O
, O
my O
hearties O

Captain O
, O
look O
to O
yourself O
; O
say O
the O
word O
: O
do O
n't O
be O
a O
fool O
; O
forget O
it O
all O
; O
we O
are O
ready O
to O

; O
treat O
us O
decently O

we O

we O
wo O

" O
Turn O

I O
make O
no O

, O
I O
say O
! O
" O
Look O
ye O
, O
now O
, O
' O
cried O
the O
Lakeman O
, O
flinging O
out O
his O
arm O
towards O
him O
, O
'there O
are O
a O
few O
of O
us O
here O

Now O
, O
as O
you O
well O
know O
, O
sir O
, O
we O
can O
claim O
our O
discharge O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
anchor O

down O

so O
we O
do O

we O

' O
" O
Turn O
to O
! O
' O
roared O
the O
captain O
. O
" O
Steelkilt O
glanced O
round O
him O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
then O
said O
: O
-I O
tell O
you O
what O
it O
is O
now O
, O
Captain O
; O
rather O
than O
kill O
ye O
, O
and O
be O
hung O
for O
such O
a O
shabby O
rascal O
, O
we O
wo O
n't O
lift O
a O
hand O
against O
ye O
unless O
ye O
attack O
us O
; O
but O
till O
you O
say O
the O
word O
about O
not O
flogging O
us O
, O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
a O
hand O
's O
turn O
. O
' O
" O
Down O
into O
the O
forecastle O
then O
, O
down O
with O
with O
ye O
: O
I O
'll O
keep O
ye O
there O
till O
ye O
're O
sick O
of O
it O
. O
Down O
ye O
go O
. O
' O
" O
Shall O
we O
? O
' O
cried O
the O
ringleader O
to O
his O
men O
. O
Most O
of O
them O
were O
against O
it O
; O
but O
at O
length O
, O
in O
obedience O
to O
Steelkilt O
, O
they O
preceded O
him O
down O
into O
their O
dark O
den O
, O
growlingly O
disappearing O
, O
like O
bears O
into O
a O
cave O
. O
As O
the O
Lakeman O
's O
bare O
head O
was O
just O
level O
with O
the O
planks O
, O
the O
captain O
and O
his O
posseleaped O
the O
barricade O
, O
and O
rapidly O
drawing O
over O
the O
slide O
of O
the O
scuttle O
, O
planted O
their O
group O
of O
hands O
upon O
it O
, O
and O
loudly O
called O
for O
the O
steward O
to O
bring O
the O
heavy O
brass O
padlock O
belonging O
to O
the O
companion- O
way O
. O
Then O
opening O
the O
slide O
a O
little O
, O
the O
captain O
whispered O
something O
down O
the O
crack O
, O
closed O
it O
, O
and O
turned O
the O
key O
upon O
them-ten O
in O
number- O
leaving O
on O
deck O
some O
twenty O
or O
more O
, O
who O
thus O
far O
had O
remained O
neutral O
. O
" O
All O
night O
a O
wide-awake O
watch O
was O
kept O
by O
all O
the O
officers O
, O
forward O
and O
aft O
, O
especially O
about O
the O
forecastle O
scuttle O
and O
fore-hatchway O
, O
at O
which O
last O
place O
it O
was O
feared O
the O
insurgents O
might O
emerge O
, O
after O
breaking O
through O
the O
bulkhead O
below O
. O
But O
the O
hours O
of O
darkness O
passed O
in O
peace O
; O
the O
men O
who O
still O
remained O
at O
their O
duty O
toiling O
hard O
at O
the O
pumps O
, O
whose O
clinking O
and O
clanking O
at O
intervals O
through O
the O
dreary O
night O
dismally O
resounded O
through O
the O
ship O
. O
" O
At O
sunrise O
the O
captain O
went O
forward O
, O
and O
knocking O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
summoned O
the O
prisoners O
to O
work O
; O
but O
with O
a O
yell O
they O
refused O
. O
Water O
was O
then O
lowered O
down O
to O
them O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
handfuls O
of O
biscuit O
were O
tossed O
after O
it O
; O
when O
again O
turning O
the O
key O
upon O
them O
and O
pocketing O
it O
, O
the O
captain O
returned O
to O
the O
quarter-deck O
. O
Twice O
every O
day O
for O
three O
days O
this O
was O
repeated O
; O
but O
on O
the O
fourth O
morning O
a O
confused O
wrangling O
, O
and O
then O
a O
scuffling O
was O
heard O
, O
as O
the O
customary O
summons O
was O
delivered O
; O
and O
suddenly O
four O
men O
burst O
up O
from O
the O
forecastle O
, O
saying O
they O
were O
ready O
to O
turn O
to O
. O
The O
fetid O
closeness O
of O
the O
air O
, O
and O
a O
famishing O
diet O
, O
united O
to O
some O
fears O
of O
ultimate O
retribution O
, O
had O
constrained O
them O
to O
sur- O
render O
at O
discretion O
. O
Emboldened O
by O
this O
, O
the O
cap- O
tain O
reiterated O
his O
demand O
to O
the O
rest O
, O
but O
Steelkilt O
shouted O
up O
to O
him O
a O
terrific O
hint O
to O
stop O
his O
bab- O
bling O
and O
betake O
himself O
where O
he O
belonged O
. O
On O
the O
fifth O
morning O
three O
other O
of O
the O
mutineers O
bolted O
up O
into O
the O
air O
from O
the O
desperate O
arms O
below O
that O
sought O
to O
restrain O
them O
. O
Only O
three O
were O
left O
. O
" O
Better O
turn O
to O
now O
! O
said O
the O
captain O
, O
with O
a O
heartless O
jeer O
. O
Shut O
us O
up O
again O
, O
will O
ye O
? O
cried O
Steelkilt O
. O
Oh O
! O
certainly O
said O
the O
captain O
, O
and O
the O
key O
clicked O
. O
It O
was O
at O
this O
point O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
that O
, O
enraged O
by O
the O
defection O
of O
seven O
of O
his O
former O
associates O
, O
and O
stung O
by O
the O
mocking O
voice O
that O
had O
last O
hailed O
him O
, O
and O
maddened O
by O
his O
long O
entomb- O
ment O
in O
a O
place O
as O
black O
as O
the O
bowels O
of O
despair O
it O
was O
then O
that O
Steelkilt O
proposed O
to O
the O
two O
Canallers O
, O
thus O
far O
apparently O
of O
one O
mind O
with O
him O
, O
to O
burst O
out O
of O
their O
hole O
at O
the O
next O
sum- O
moning O
of O
the O
garrison O
; O
and O
armed O
with O
their O
keen O
mincing O
knives O
( O
long O
, O
crescentic O
, O
heavy O
in- O
plements O
with O
a O
handle O
at O
each O
end O
) O
, O
run O
a O
muck O
from O
the O
bowsprit O
to O
the O
taffrail O
; O
and O
if O
by O
any O
devilishness O
of O
desperation O
possible O
, O
seize O
the O
ship O
. O
For O
himself O
, O
he O
would O
do O
this O
, O
he O
said O
, O
whether O
they O
joined O
him O
or O
not O
. O
That O
was O
the O
last O
night O
he O
should O
spend O
in O
that O
den O
. O
But O
the O
scheme O
met O
with O
no O
opposition O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
other O
two O
: O
they O
swore O
they O
were O
ready O
for O
that O
, O
or O
for O
any O
other O
mad O
thing O
; O
for O
anything O
in O
short O
but O
a O
surrender O
. O
And O
what O
was O
more O
, O
they O
each O
in- O
sisted O
upon O
being O
the O
first O
man O
on O
deck O
, O
when O
the O
time O
to O
make O
the O
rush O
should O
come O
. O
But O
to O
this O
their O
leader O
as O
fiercely O
objected O
, O
reserving O
that O
priority O
for O
himself O
; O
particularly O
as O
his O
two O
comrades O
would O
not O
yield O
, O
the O
one O
to O
the O
other O
, O
in O
the O
matter O
; O
and O
both O
of O
them O
could O
not O
be O
first O
, O
for O
the O
ladder O
would O
but O
admit O
one O
man O
at O
a O
time O
. O
And O
here O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
the O
foul O
play O
of O
these O
mis- O
creants O
must O
come O
out O
. O
" O
Upon O
hearing O
the O
frantic O
project O
of O
their O
leader O
, O
each O
in O
his O
own O
separate O
soul O
had O
suddenly O
lighted O
, O
it O
would O
seem O
, O
upon O
the O
same O
piece O
of O
treachery O
; O
namely O
, O
to O
be O
foremost O
in O
breaking O
out O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
the O
first O
of O
the O
three O
, O
though O
the O
last O
of O
the O
ten O
, O
to O
surrender O
; O
and O
thereby O
secure O
whatever O
small O
chance O
of O
pardon O
such O
con- O
duct O
might O
merit O
. O
But O
when O
Steckilt O
made O
known O
his O
determination O
still O
to O
lead O
them O
to O
the O
last O
, O
they O
in O
some O
way O
, O
by O
some O
subtle O
chemistry O
of O
villany O
, O
mixed O
their O
before O
secret O
treacheries O
together O
; O
and O
when O
their O
leader O
fell O
into O
a O
doze O
, O
verbally O
opened O
their O
souls O
to O
each O
other O
in O
three O
sentences O
; O
and O
bound O
the O
sleeper O
with O
cords O
, O
and O
gagged O
him O
with O
cords O
; O
and O
shrieked O
out O
for O
the O
captain O
at O
midnight O
. O
" O
Thinking O
murder O
at O
hand O
, O
and O
smelling O
in O
the O
dark O
for O
the O
blood O
, O
he O
and O
all O
his O
armed O
mates O
and O
harpooneers O
rushed O
for O
the O
forecastle O
. O
In O
a O
few O
minutes O
the O
scuttle O
was O
opened O
, O
and O
, O
bound O
hand O
and O
foot O
, O
the O
still O
struggling O
ringleader O
was O
shoved O
up O
into O
the O
air O
by O
his O
perfidious O
allies O
, O
who O
at O
once O
claimed O
the O
honour O
of O
securing O
a O
man O
who O
had O
been O
fully O
ripe O
for O
murder O
. O
But O
all O
these O
were O
collared O
, O
and O
dragged O
along O
the O
deck O
like O
dead O
cattle O
; O
and O
, O
side O
by O
side O
, O
were O
seized O
up O
into O
the O
mizen O
rigging O
, O
like O
three O
quarters O
of O
meat O
, O
and O
there O
they O
hung O
till O
morning O
. O
'D- O
ye O
, O
cried O
the O
captain O
, O
pacing O
to O
and O
fro O
before O
them O
, O
the O
vultures O
would O
not O
touch O
ye O
, O
ye O
villains O
. O
" O
At O
sunrise O
he O
summoned O
all O
hands O
; O
and O
separating O
those O
who O
had O
rebelled O
from O
those O
who O
had O
taken O
no O
part O
in O
the O
mutiny O
, O
he O
told O
the O
former O
that O
he O
had O
a O
good O
mind O
to O
flog O
them O
all O
round-thought O
, O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
he O
would O
do O
so O
he O
ought O
to-justice O
demanded O
it O
; O
but O
for O
the O
present O
, O
considering O
their O
timely O
surrender O
, O
he O
would O
let O
them O
go O
with O
a O
reprimand O
, O
which O
he O
accordingly O
administered O
in O
the O
vernacular O
. O
But O
as O
for O
you O
, O
ye O
carrion O
rogues O
, O
turning O
to O
the O
three O
men O
in O
the O
rigging-for O
you O
, O
I O
mean O
to O
mince O
ye O
up O
for O
the O
twy-pots O
; O
and O
, O
seizing O
a O
rope O
, O
he O
applied O
it O
with O
all O
his O
might O
to O
the O
backs O
of O
the O
two O
traitors O
, O
till O
they O
yelled O
no O
more O
, O
but O
lifelessly O
hung O
their O
heads O
sideways O
, O
as O
the O
two O
crucified O
thieves O
are O
drawn O
. O
My O
wrist O
is O
sprained O
with O
ye O
! O
he O
cried O
at O
last O
; O
but O
there O
is O
still O
rope O
enough O
left O
for O
you O
, O
my O
fine O
bantam O
, O
that O
would O
n't O
give O
up O
. O
Take O
that O
gag O
from O
his O
mouth O
, O
and O
let O
us O
hear O
what O
he O
can O
say O
for O
himself O
. O
For O
a O
moment O
the O
exhausted O
mutineer O
made O
a O
tremulous O
motion O
of O
his O
cramped O
jaws O
, O
and O
then O
painfully O
twisting O
round O
his O
head O
, O
said O
in O
a O
sort O
of O
hiss O
, O
What O
I O
say O
is O
this-and O
mind O
it O
well-if O
you O
flog O
me O
, O
I O
murder O
you O
Say O
ye O
so O
? O
then O
see O
how O
ye O
frighten O
me- O
and O
the O
captain O
drew O
off O
with O
the O
rope O
to O
strike O
. O
Best O
nothissed O
the O
Lakeman O
. O
But O
I O
mustand O
the O
rope O
was O
once O
more O
drawn O
back O
for O
the O
stroke O
. O
Steelkilt O
here O
hissed O
out O
something O
, O
inaudible O
to O
all O
but O
the O
captain O
; O
who O
, O
to O
the O
amazement O
of O
all O
hands O
, O
started O
back O
, O
paced O
the O
deck O
rapidly O
two O
or O
three O
times O
, O
and O
then O
suddenly O
throwing O
down O
his O
rope O
, O
said O
, O
I O
wo O
n't O
do O
it-let O
him O
go- O
cut O
him O
down O
: O
d O
'ye O
hear O
? O
But O
as O
the O
junior O
mates O
were O
hurrying O
to O
execute O
the O
order O
, O
a O
pale O
man O
, O
with O
a O
bandaged O
head O
, O
arrested O
them-Radney O
, O
the O
chief O
mate O
. O
Ever O
since O
the O
blow O
, O
he O
had O
lain O
in O
his O
berth O
; O
but O
that O
morning O
, O
hearing O
the O
tumult O
on O
the O
deck O
, O
he O
had O
crept O
out O
, O
and O
thus O
far O
had O
watched O
the O
whole O
scene O
. O
Such O
was O
the O
state O
of O
his O
mouth O
, O
that O
he O
could O
hardly O
speak O
; O
but O
mumbling O
some- O
thing O
about O
his O
being O
willing O
and O
able O
to O
do O
what O
the O
captain O
dared O
not O
attempt O
, O
he O
snatched O
the O
rope O
, O
and O
advanced O
to O
his O
pinioned O
foe O
. O
" O
You O
are O
a O
coward O
! O
hissed O
the O
Lakeman O
. O
So O
I O
am O
, O
but O
take O
that O
. O
The O
mate O
was O
in O
the O
very O
act O
of O
striking O
, O
when O
another O
hiss O
stayed O
his O
uplifted O
arm O
. O
He O
paused O
: O
and O
then O
pausing O
no O
more O
, O
made O
good O
his O
word O
, O
spite O
of O
Steelkilt O
's O
threat O
, O
whatever O
that O
might O
have O
been O
. O
The O
three O
men O
were O
then O
cut O
down O
, O
all O
hands O
were O
turned O
to O
, O
and O
, O
sullenly O
worked O
by O
the O
moody O
seamen O
, O
the O
iron O
pumps O
clanged O
as O
before O
. O
Just O
after O
dark O
that O
day O
, O
when O
one O
watch O
had O
retired O
below O
, O
a O
clamour O
was O
heard O
in O
the O
fore- O
castle O
; O
and O
the O
two O
trembling O
traitors O
running O
up O
, O
besieged O
the O
cabin O
door O
, O
saying O
they O
durst O
not O
consort O
with O
the O
crew O
. O
Entreaties O
, O
cuffs O
, O
and O
kicks O
could O
not O
drive O
them O
back O
, O
so O
at O
their O
own O
instance O
they O
were O
put O
down O
in O
the O
ship O
's O
run O
for O
security O
. O
Still O
no O
sign O
of O
mutiny O
re-appeared O
among O
the O
rest O
. O
On O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
seemed O
that O
, O
mainly O
at O
Steelkilt O
's O
instigation O
, O
they O
had O
re- O
solved O
to O
maintain O
the O
strictest O
peacefulness O
, O
obey O
all O
orders O
to O
the O
last O
, O
and O
, O
when O
the O
ship O
reached O
port O
, O
desert O
her O
in O
a O
body O
. O
But O
in O
order O
to O
insure O
the O
speediest O
end O
to O
the O
voyage O
, O
they O
all O
agreed O
to O
another O
thing-namely O
, O
not O
to O
sing O
out O
for O
whales O
, O
in O
case O
any O
should O
be O
discovered O
. O
For O
, O
spite O
of O
her O
leek O
, O
and O
spite O
of O
all O
her O
other O
perils O
, O
the O
Town-Ho O
still O
maintained O
her O
mast- O
heads O
, O
and O
her O
captain O
was O
just O
as O
willing O
to O
lower O
for O
a O
fish O
that O
moment O
, O
as O
on O
the O
day O
his O
craft O
first O
struck O
the O
cruising O
ground O
; O
and O
Radney O
the O
mate O
was O
quite O
as O
ready O
to O
change O
his O
berth O
for O
a O
boat O
, O
and O
with O
his O
bandaged O
mouth O
seek O
to O
gag O
in O
death O
the O
vital O
jaw O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
" O
But O
though O
the O
Lakeman O
had O
induced O
the O
sea- O
men O
to O
adopt O
this O
sort O
of O
passiveness O
in O
their O
con- O
duct O
, O
he O
kept O
his O
own O
counsel O
( O
at O
least O
till O
all O
was O
over O
) O
concerning O
his O
own O
proper O
and O
private O
re- O
venge O
upon O
the O
man O
who O
had O
stung O
him O
in O
the O
ven- O
tricles O
of O
his O
heart O
. O
He O
was O
in O
Radney O
, O
the O
chief O
mate O
's O
watch O
; O
and O
as O
if O
the O
infatuated O
man O
sought O
to O
run O
more O
than O
half O
way O
to O
meet O
his O
doom O
, O
after O
the O
scene O
at O
the O
rigging O
, O
he O
insisted O
, O
against O
the O
express O
counsel O
of O
the O
captain O
, O
upon O
resuming O
the O
head O
of O
his O
watch O
at O
night O
. O
Upon O
this O
, O
and O
one O
or O
two O
other O
circumstances O
, O
Steckilt O
systematically O
built O
the O
plan O
of O
his O
revenge O
. O
" O
During O
the O
night O
, O
Radney O
had O
an O
unseaman- O
like O
way O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
bulwarks O
of O
the O
quarter- O
deck O
, O
and O
leaning O
his O
arm O
upon O
the O
gunwale O
of O
the O
boat O
which O
was O
hoisted O
up O
there O
, O
a O
little O
above O
the O
ship O
's O
side O
. O
In O
this O
attitude O
, O
it O
was O
well O
known O
, O
he O
sometimes O
dozed O
. O
There O
was O
a O
considerable O
vacancy O
between O
the O
boat O
and O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
down O
between O
this O
was O
the O
sea O
. O
Steelkilt O
calculated O
his O
time O
, O
and O
found O
that O
his O
next O
trick O
at O
the O
helm O
would O
come O
round O
at O
two O
o'clock O
, O
in O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
third O
day O
from O
that O
in O
which O
he O
had O
been O
betrayed O
. O
At O
his O
leisure O
, O
he O
em- O
ployed O
the O
interval O
in O
braiding O
something O
very O
carefully O
in O
his O
watches O
below O
. O
" O
What O
are O
you O
making O
there O
? O
" O
said O
ashipmate O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
what O
does O
it O
look O
like O
? O
" O
Like O
a O
lanyard O
for O
your O
bag O
; O
but O
it O
's O
an O
odd O
one O
, O
seems O
to O
me O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
rather O
oddish O
, O
said O
the O
Lakeman O
, O
hold- O
ing O
it O
at O
arm O
's O
length O
before O
him O
; O
but O
I O
think O
it O
will O
answer O
. O
Shipmate O
, O
I O
have O
n't O
enough O
twine O
, O
-have O
you O
any O
? O
" O
But O
there O
was O
none O
in O
the O
forecastle O
. O
" O
Then O
I O
must O
get O
some O
from O
old O
Rad O
; O
and O
he O
rose O
to O
go O
aft O
. O
" O
You O
do O
n't O
mean O
to O
go O
a O
begging O
to O
him O
! O
said O
a O
sailor O
. O
" O
Why O
not O
? O
Do O
you O
think O
he O
wo O
n't O
do O
me O
a O
turn O
, O
when O
it O
's O
to O
help O
himself O
in O
the O
end O
, O
ship- O
mate O
? O
and O
going O
to O
the O
mate O
, O
he O
looked O
at O
him O
quietly O
, O
and O
asked O
him O
for O
some O
twine O
to O
mend O
his O
hammock O
. O
It O
was O
given O
him-neither O
twine O
nor O
lanyard O
were O
seen O
again O
; O
but O
the O
next O
night O
an O
iron O
ball O
, O
closely O
netted O
, O
partly O
rolled O
from O
the O
pocket O
of O
the O
Lakeman O
's O
monkey-jacket O
, O
as O
he O
was O
tucking O
the O
coat O
into O
his O
hammock O
for O
a O
pillow O
. O
Twenty-four O
hours O
after O
, O
his O
trick O
at O
the O
silent O
helm-nigh O
to O
the O
man O
who O
was O
apt O
to O
doze O
over O
the O
grave O
always O
ready O
dug O
to O
the O
seaman O
's O
hand-that O
fatal O
hour O
was O
then O
to O
come O
; O
and O
in O
the O
fore-ordaining O
soul O
of O
Steelklit O
, O
the O
mate O
was O
already O
stark O
and O
stretched O
as O
a O
corpse O
, O
with O
his O
forehead O
crushed O
in O
. O
" O
But O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
a O
fool O
saved O
the O
would-be O
murderer O
from O
the O
bloody O
deed O
he O
had O
planned O
. O
Yet O
complete O
revenge O
he O
had O
, O
and O
without O
being O
the O
avenger O
. O
For O
by O
a O
mysterious O
fatality O
, O
Heaven O
itself O
seemed O
to O
step O
in O
to O
take O
out O
of O
his O
hands O
into O
its O
own O
the O
damning O
thing O
he O
would O
have O
done O

" O
It O
was O
just O
between O
daybreak O
and O
sunrise O
of O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
second O

so O
suddenly O
perceiving O
the O
snowy O
whale O
within O
fifty O
yards O
of O
the O
ship- O
forgetful O
of O
the O
compact O
among O
the O
crew-in O
the O
excitement O
of O
the O
moment O
, O
the O
Teneriffe O
man O
had O
instinctively O

involuntarily O
lifted O
his O
voice O
for O
the O
monster O

for O
some O
little O
time O
past O

had O
been O
plainly O

from O
the O
three O
sullen O
mast- O
heads O

All O
was O
now O
a O
frenzy O

The O
White O
Whale-the O
White O
Whale O
! O
was O
the O
cry O
from O
captain O
, O
mates O
, O
and O
harpooneers O
, O
who O
, O
undeterred O
by O
fearful O
rumours O
, O
were O
all O
anxious O
to O
capture O
so O
famous O
and O
precious O
a O
fish O
; O
while O
the O
dogged O
crew O
eyed O
askance O

with O
curses O

the O
appalling O
beauty O
of O
the O
vast O
milky O
mass O

that O
, O
lit O
up O
by O
a O
horizontal O
spangling O
sun O

shifted O

Gentlemen O
, O
a O
strange O
fatality O
pervades O
the O
whole O
career O
of O
these O
events O
, O
as O
if O
verily O
mapped O
out O
before O
the O
world O
itself O
was O
charted O

mutineer O
was O
the O

lowered O
, O
the O
mate O
's O
got O
the O
start O
; O
and O
none O
howled O
more O
fiercely O
with O
delight O
than O
did O
Steellkit O
, O
as O
he O
strained O
at O
his O
oar O
. O
After O
a O
stiff O
pull O
, O
their O
harpooneer O
got O
fast O
, O
and O
, O
spear O
in O
hand O
, O
Radney O
sprang O
to O
the O
bow O
. O
He O
was O
always O
a O
furious O
man O
, O
it O
seems O
, O
in O
a O
boat O
. O
And O
now O
his O
bandaged O
cry O
was O
, O
to O
beach O
him O
on O
the O
whale O
's O
topmast O
back O
. O
Nothing O
loth O
, O
his O
bowsman O
hauled O
him O
up O
and O
up O
, O
through O
a O
blind- O
ing O
foam O
that O
blent O
two O
whitenesses O
together O
; O
till O
of O
a O
sudden O
the O
boat O
struck O
as O
against O
a O
sunken O
ledge O
, O
and O
keeling O
over O
, O
spilled O
out O
the O
standing O
mate O
. O
That O
instant O
, O
as O
he O
fell O
on O
the O
whale O
's O
slippery O
back O
, O
the O
boat O
righted O
, O
and O
was O
dashed O
aside O
by O
the O
swell O
, O
while O
Radney O
was O
tossed O
over O
into O
the O
sea O
, O
on O
the O
other O
flank O
of O
the O
whale O
. O
He O
struck O
out O
through O
the O
spray O
, O
and O
, O
for O
an O
instant O
, O
was O
dimly O
seen O
through O
that O
veil O
, O
wildly O
secking O
to O
remove O
himself O
from O
the O
eye O
of O
Moby O
Dick O
. O
But O
the O
whale O
rushed O
round O
in O
a O
sudden O
maelstrom O
; O
seized O
the O
swimmer O
between O
his O
jaws O
; O
and O
rearing O
high O
up O
with O
him O
, O
plunged O
headlong O
again O
, O
and O
went O
down O
. O
" O
Meantime O
, O
at O
the O
first O
tap O
of O
the O
boat O
's O
bot- O
tom O
, O
the O
Lakeman O
had O
slackened O
the O
line O
, O
so O
as O
to O
drop O
astern O
from O
the O
whirlpool O
: O
calmly O
looking O
on O
, O
he O
thought O
his O
own O
thoughts O
. O
But O
a O
sudden O
, O
terrific O
, O
downward O
jerking O
of O
the O
boat O
, O
quickly O
brought O
his O
knife O
to O
the O
line O
. O
He O
cut O
it O
; O
and O
the O
whale O
was O
free O
. O
But O
, O
at O
some O
distance O
, O
Moby O
Dick O
rose O
again O
, O
with O
some O
tatters O
of O
Radney O
's O
red O
woollen O
shirt O
, O
caught O
in O
the O
teeth O
that O
had O
destroyed O
him O
. O
All O
four O
boats O
gave O
chase O
again O
; O
but O
the O
whale O
eluded O
them O
, O
and O
finally O
wholly O
disappeared O
. O
" O
In O
good O
time O
, O
the O
Town-Ho O
reached O
her O
port O
a O
savage O
, O
solitary O
place-where O
no O
civilized O
creature O
resided O
. O
There O
, O
headed O
by O
the O
Lake- O
man O
, O
all O
but O
five O
or O
six O
of O
the O
foremast-men O
deli- O
berately O
deserted O
among O
the O
palms O
; O
eventually O
, O
as O
it O
turned O
out O
, O
seizing O
a O
large O
double O
war-canoe O
of O
the O
savages O
, O
and O
setting O
sail O
for O
some O
other O
harbour O
. O
" O
The O
ship O
's O
company O
being O
reduced O
to O
but O
a O
handful O
, O
the O
captain O
called O
upon O
the O
Islanders O
to O
assist O
him O
in O
the O
laborious O
business O
of O
heaving O
down O
the O
ship O
to O
stop O
the O
leak O
. O
But O
to O
such O
un- O
resting O
vigilance O
over O
their O
dangerous O
allies O
was O
this O
small O
band O
of O
whites O
necessitated O
, O
both O
by O
night O
and O
by O
day O
, O
and O
so O
extreme O
was O
the O
hard O
work O
they O
underwent O
, O
that O
upon O
the O
vessel O
being O
ready O
again O
for O
sea O
, O
they O
were O
in O
such O
a O
weakened O
condition O
that O
the O
captain O
durst O
not O
put O
off O
with O
them O
in O
so O
heavy O
a O
vessel O
. O
After O
taking O
counsel O
with O
his O
officers O
, O
he O
anchored O
the O
ship O
as O
far O
off O
shore O
as O
possible O
; O
loaded O
and O
ran O
out O
his O
two O
cannons O
from O
the O
bows O
; O
stacked O
his O
muskets O
on O
the O
poop O
; O
and O
warning O
the O
Islanders O
not O
to O
approach O
the O
ship O
at O
their O
peril O
, O
took O
one O
man O
with O
him O
, O
and O
setting O
the O
sail O
of O
his O
best O
whaleboat O
, O
steered O
straight O
before O
the O
wind O
for O
Tahiti O
, O
five O
hundred O
miles O
distant O
, O
to O
procure O
a O
reinforcement O
to O
his O
crew O
. O
" O
On O
the O
fourth O
day O
of O
the O
sail O
, O
a O
large O
canoe O
was O
descried O
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
have O
touched O
at O
a O
low O
isle O
of O
corals O
. O
He O
steered O
away O
from O
it O
; O
but O
the O
savage O
craft O
bore O
down O
on O
him O
; O
and O
soon O
the O
voice O
of O
Steelkilt O
hailed O
him O
to O
heave-to O
, O
or O
he O
would O
run O
him O
under O
water O
. O
The O
captain O
pre- O
sented O
a O
pistol O
. O
With O
one O
foot O
on O
each O
prow O
of O
the O
yoked O
war-canoes O
, O
the O
Lakeman O
laughed O
him O
to O
scorn O
; O
assuring O
him O
that O
if O
the O
pistol O
so O
much O
as O
clicked O
in O
the O
lock O
, O
he O
would O
bury O
him O
in O
bubbles O
and O
foam O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
want O
of O
me O
? O
' O
cried O
the O
captain O
. O
" O
Where O
are O
you O
bound O
? O
and O
for O
what O
are O
you O
bound O
? O
' O
demanded O
Steelkilt O
; O
' O
no O
lies O
. O
' O
" O
I O
am O
bound O
to O
Tahiti O
for O
more O
men O
. O
" O
Very O
good O
. O
Let O
me O
board O
you O
a O
moment- O
I O
come O
in O
peace O
. O
' O
With O
that O
he O
leaped O
from O
the O
canoe O
, O
swam O
to O
the O
boat O
; O
and O
climbing O
. O
the O
gun- O
wale O
, O
stood O
face O
to O
face O
with O
the O
captain O
. O
" O
Cross O
your O
arms O
, O
sir O
; O
throw O
back O
your O
head O
. O
Now O
, O
repeat O
after O
me O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
Steelkilt O
leaves O
me O
, O
I O
swear O
to O
beach O
this O
boat O
on O
yonder O
island O
, O
and O
remain O
there O
six O
days O
. O
If O
I O
do O
not O
, O
may O
lightnings O
strike O
me O
! O
A O
pretty O
scholar O
, O
laughed O
the O
Lakeman O
. O
Adios O
, O
Senor O
! O
and O
leaping O
into O
the O
sea O
he O
swam O
back O
to O
his O
comrades O
. O
Watching O
the O
boat O
till O
it O
was O
fairly O
beached O
and O
drawn O
up O
to O
the O
roots O
of O
the O
cocoa-nut O
trees O
, O
Steelkilt O
made O
sail O
again O
, O
and O
in O
due O
time O
arrived O
at O
Tahiti O
, O
his O
own O
place O
of O
destination O
. O
There O
, O
luck O
befriended O
him O
; O
two O
ships O
were O
about O
to O
sail O
for O
France O
, O
and O
were O
providentially O
in O
want O
of O
precisely O
that O
number O
of O
men O
which O
the O
sailor O
headed O
. O
They O
embarked O
; O
and O
so O
for O
ever O
got O
the O
start O
of O
their O
former O
captain O
, O
had O
he O
been O
at O
all O
minded O
to O
work O
them O
legal O
retribution O
. O
Some O
ten O
days O
after O
the O
French O
ships O
sailed O
, O
the O
whale-boat O
arrived O
, O
and O
the O
captain O
was O
forced O
to O
enlist O
some O
of O
the O
more O
civilized O
Tahitians O
, O
who O
had O
been O
somewhat O
used O
to O
the O
sea O
. O
Chartering O
a O
small O
native O
schooner O
, O
he O
returned O
with O
them O
to O
his O
vessel O
; O
and O
finding O
all O
right O
there O
, O
again O
re- O
sumed O
his O
cruisings O
. O
Where O
Steelkilt O
now O
is O
, O
gentlemen O
, O
none O
know O
; O
but O
upon O
the O
island O
of O
Nantucket O
, O
the O
widow O
of O
Radney O
still O
turns O
to O
the O
sea O
which O
re- O
fuses O
to O
give O
up O
its O
dead O
; O
still O
in O
dreams O
sees O
the O
awful O
white O
whale O
that O
destroyed O
him O
. O

" O

Don O

quietly O

" O

Then O
I O
entreat O
you O
to O
tell O
me O
, O
if O
, O
to O
the O
best O
of O
your O
own O
convictions O

this O
your O
story O
is O

It O
is O
so O
passing O
wonderful O
! O
Did O
you O
get O
it O
from O
an O
unquestionable O
source O

Bear O
with O
me O
if O
I O
seem O
to O
press O

Also O

us O

all O
join O
in O
Don O
Sebastian O
's O
suit O

the O
com- O
pany O
, O
with O
exceeding O
interest O

Is O
there O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
Holy O
Evangelists O
in O

Golden O
Inn O

Nay O

Don O
Sebastian O
; O

I O

a O
worthy O
priest O
near O
by O
, O
who O
will O
quickly O
procure O
one O
for O
me O

I O
go O
for O
it O

But O
are O
you O
well O
ad- O
vised O
? O
this O
may O
grow O
too O
serious O

Will O
you O
be O
so O
good O
as O
to O
bring O
the O
priest O
also O

Don O

Though O

Auto-da-Fes O

one O

company O
to O
another O
; O
I O
fear O
our O
sailor O
friend O
runs O
risk O
of O
the O
archiepiscopacy O
. O
Let O
us O
withdraw O
more O
out O
of O
the O
moonlight O

I O
see O
no O
