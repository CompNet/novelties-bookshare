That O
whale O
of O
Stubb O
's O
, O
so O
dearly O
purchased O
, O
was O
duly O
brought O
to O
the O
Pequod O
's O
side O
, O
where O
all O
those O
cutting O
and O
hoisting O
operations O
, O
previously O
de- O
tailcd O
, O
were O
regularly O
gone O
through O
, O
even O
to O
the O
baling O
of O
the O
Heidelberg O
Tun O
, O
or O
Case O
. O
While O
some O
were O
occupied O
with O
this O
latter O
duty O
, O
others O
were O
employed O
in O
dragging O
away O
the O
larger O
tubs O
, O
so O
soon O
as O
filled O
with O
the O
sperm O
; O
and O
when O
the O
proper O
time O
arrived O
, O
this O
same O
sperm O
was O
care- O
fully O
manipulated O
ere O
going O
to O
the O
try-works O
; O
-of O
which O
anon O
. O
It O
had O
cooled O
and O
crystallized O
to O
such O
a O
degree O
, O
that O
when O
, O
with O
several O
others O
, O
I O
sat O
down O
before O
a O
large O
Constantine O
's O
bath O
of O
it O
, O
I O
found O
it O
strangely O
concreted O
into O
lumps O
, O
here O
and O
there O
rolling O
about O
in O
the O
liquid O
part O
. O
It O
was O
our O
business O
to O
squeeze O
these O
lumps O
back O
into O
fluid O
. O
A O
sweet O
and O
uncruous O
duty O
! O
No O
wonder O
that O
in O
old O
times O
this O
sperm O
was O
such O
a O
favourite O
cosmetic O
. O
Such O
a O
clearer O
! O
such O
a O
sweetener O
! O
such O
a O
softener O
! O
such O
a O
delicious O
mollifier O
! O
After O
having O
my O
hands O
in O
it O
for O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
, O
my O
fingers O
felt O
like O
eels O
, O
and O
began O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
to O
serpentine O
and O
spiralize O
. O
As O
I O
sat O
there O
at O
my O
ease O
, O
cross-legged O
on O
the O
deck O
; O
after O
the O
bitter O
exertion O
at O
the O
windlass O
; O
under O
a O
blue O
tranquil O
sky O
; O
the O
ship O
under O
indolent O
sail O
, O
and O
gliding O
so O
serenely O
along O
; O
-as O
I O
bathed O
my O
hands O
among O
those O
soft O
, O
gentle O
globules O
of O
infiltrated O
tissues O
, O
woven O
almost O
within O
the O
hour O
; O
as O
they O
richly O
broke O
to O
my O
fingers O
, O
and O
discharged O
all O
their O
opulence O
, O
like O
fully-ripe O
grapes O
their O
wine O
; O
as O
I O
sniffed O
up O
that O
uncontaminated O
aroma O
, O
-literally O
and O
truly O
, O
like O
the O
smell O
of O
spring O
violets O
; O
I O
declare O
to O
you O
, O
that O
for O
the O
time O
I O
lived O
as O
in O
a O
musky O
meadow O
; O
I O
forgot O
all O
about O
our O
horrible O
oath O
. O
In O
that O
inexpressible O
sperm O
, O
I O
washed O
my O
hands O
and O
my O
heart O
of O
it O
; O
I O
almost O
began O
to O
credit O
the O
old O
Paracelsan O
superstition O
, O
that O
sperm O
is O
of O
rare O
virtue O
in O
allaying O
the O
heat O
of O
anger O
: O
while O
bathing O
in O
that O
bath O
, O
I O
felt O
divinely O
free O
from O
all O
ill-will O
, O
or O
petulance O
, O
or O
malice O
, O
of O
any O
sort O
whatsoever O
. O
Squeeze O
! O
squeeze O
! O
squeeze O
! O
all O
the O
morning O
long O
. O
I O
squeezed O
that O
sperm O
till O
I O
myself O
almost O
melted O
into O
it O
; O
I O
squeezed O
that O
sperm O
till O
a O
strange O
sort O
of O
insanity O
came O
over O
me O
; O
and O
I O
found O
myself O
unwittingly O
squeezing O
my O
co-labourers O
' O
hands O
in O
it O
, O
mistaking O
their O
hands O
for O
the O
gentle O
globules O
. O
Such O
an O
abounding O
, O
affectionate O
, O
friendly O
, O
loving O
feeling O
did O
this O
avocation O
beget O
, O
than O
at O
last O
I O
was O
continually O
squeezing O
their O
hands O
, O
and O
looking O
up O
into O
their O
eyes O
sentimen- O
tally O
, O
as O
much O
as O
to O
say— O
" O
Oh O
! O
my O
dear O
fellow- O
beings O
, O
why O
should O
we O
longer O
cherish O
any O
social O
acerbities O
, O
or O
know O
the O
slightest O
ill-humour O
or O
envy O
? O
Come O
; O
let O
us O
squeeze O
hands O
all O
round O
; O
nay O
, O
let O
us O
all O
squeeze O
ourselves O
into O
each O
other O
; O
let O
us O
squeeze O
ourselves O
universally O
into O
the O
very O
milk O
and O
sperm O
of O
kindness O
! O
" O
Would O
that O
I O
could O
keep O
squeezing O
that O
sperm O
for O
ever O
! O
For O
now O
, O
since O
by O
many O
prolonged O
, O
repeated O
experiences O
, O
I O
have O
perceived O
that O
in O
all O
cases O
man O
must O
eventually O
lower O
, O
or O
at O
least O
shift O
, O
his O
conceit O
of O
attainable O
felicity O
; O
not O
placing O
it O
anywhere O
in O
the O
intellect O
or O
the O
fancy O
; O
but O
in O
the O
wife O
, O
the O
heart O
, O
the O
bed O
, O
the O
table O
, O
the O
saddle O
, O
the O
fireside O
, O
the O
country-now O
that O
I O
have O
perceived O
all O
this O
, O
I O
am O
ready O
to O
squeeze O
case O
eternally O
. O
In O
thoughts O
of O
the O
visions O
of O
the O
night O
, O
I O
saw O
long O
rows O
of O
angels O
in O
paradise O
, O
each O
with O
his O
hands O
in O
a O
jar O
of O
spermaceti O
. O

Now O
, O
while O
discoursing O
of O
sperm O
, O
it O
behoves O
to O
speak O
of O
other O
things O
akin O
to O
it O
, O
in O
the O
business O
of O
preparing O
the O
Sperm O
whale O
for O
the O
try-works O
. O
First O
comes O
white-horse O
, O
so O
called O
, O
which O
is O
ob- O
tained O
from O
the O
tapering O
part O
of O
the O
fish O
, O
and O
also O
from O
the O
thicker O
portions O
of O
his O
flukes O
. O
It O
is O
tough O
with O
congealed O
tendons-a O
wad O
of O
muscle- O
but O
still O
contains O
some O
oil O
. O
After O
being O
severed O
from O
the O
whale O
, O
the O
white-horse O
is O
first O
cut O
into O
portable O
oblongs O
ere O
going O
to O
the O
mincer O
. O
They O
look O
much O
like O
blocks O
of O
Berkshire O
marble O
. O
Plum-pudding O
is O
the O
term O
bestowed O
upon O
cer- O
tain O
fragmentary O
parts O
of O
the O
whale O
's O
flesh O
, O
here O
and O
there O
adhering O
to O
the O
blanket O
of O
blubber O
, O
and O
often O
participating O
to O
a O
considerable O
degree O
in O
its O
unctuousness O
. O
It O
is O
a O
most O
refreshing O
, O
convivial O
, O
beautiful O
object O
to O
behold O
. O
As O
its O
name O
imports O
, O
it O
is O
of O
an O
exceedingly O
rich O
, O
mottled O
tint O
, O
with O
a O
bestreaked O
snowy O
and O
golden O
ground O
, O
dotted O
with O
spots O
of O
the O
deepest O
crimson O
and O
purple O
. O
It O
is O
plums O
of O
rubies O
, O
in O
pictures O
of O
citron O
. O
Spite O
of O
reason O
, O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
keep O
yourself O
from O
eating O
it O
. O
I O
confess O
, O
that O
once O
I O
stole O
behind O
the O
foremast O
to O
try O
it O
. O
It O
tasted O
something O
as O
I O
should O
conceive O
a O
royal O
cutlet O
from O
the O
thigh O
of O
Louis O
le O
Gros O
might O
have O
tasted O
, O
supposing O
him O
to O
have O
been O
killed O
the O
first O
day O
after O
the O
venison O
season O
, O
and O
that O
particu- O
lar O
venison O
season O
contemporary O
with O
an O
unusually O
fine O
vintage O
of O
the O
vineyards O
of O
Champagne O
. O
There O
is O
another O
substance O
, O
a O
very O
singular O
one O
, O
which O
turns O
up O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
business O
, O
but O
which O
I O
feel O
it O
to O
be O
very O
puzzling O
adequately O
to O
describe O
. O
It O
is O
called O
slobgollion O
; O
an O
appellation O
original O
with O
the O
whalemen O
, O
and O
even O
so O
is O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
substance O
. O
It O
is O
an O
ineffably O
oozy O
, O
stringy O
affair O
, O
most O
frequently O
found O
in O
tubs O
of O
sperm O
, O
after O
a O
prolonged O
squeezing O
, O
and O
subse- O
quent O
decanting O
. O
I O
hold O
it O
to O
be O
the O
wondrously O
thin O
ruptured O
membranes O
of O
the O
case O
coalescing O
. O
Gurry O
, O
so O
called O
, O
is O
a O
term O
properly O
belonging O
to O
Right O
whalemen O
, O
but O
sometimes O
incidentally O
used O
by O
the O
Sperm O
fishermen O
. O
It O
designates O
the O
dark O
, O
glutinous O
substance O
which O
is O
scraped O
off O
the O
back O
of O
the O
Greenland O
or O
Right O
whale O
, O
and O
much O
of O
which O
covers O
the O
decks O
of O
those O
inferior O
souls O
who O
hunt O
that O
ignoble O
Leviathan O
. O
Nippers O
. O
Strictly O
this O
word O
is O
not O
indigenous O
to O
the O
whale O
's O
vocabulary O
; O
but O
as O
applied O
by O
whalemen O
, O
it O
becomes O
so O
. O
A O
whaleman O
's O
nipper O
is O
a O
short O
firm O
strip O
of O
tendinous O
stuff O
cut O
from O
the O
tapering O
part O
of O
Leviathan O
's O
tail O
: O
it O
averages O
an O
inch O
in O
thickness O
, O
and O
for O
the O
rest O
, O
is O
about O
the O
size O
of O
the O
iron O
part O
of O
a O
hoe O
. O
Edgewise O
moved O
along O
the O
oily O
deck O
, O
it O
operates O
like O
a O
leathern O
squilgee O
; O
and O
by O
nameless O
blandishments O
, O
as O
of O
magic O
, O
allures O
along O
with O
it O
all O
impurities O
. O
But O
to O
learn O
all O
about O
these O
recondite O
matters O
, O
your O
best O
way O
is O
at O
once O
to O
descend O
into O
the O
blub- O
ber-room O
, O
and O
have O
a O
long O
talk O
with O
its O
inmates O
. O
This O
place O
has O
previously O
been O
mentioned O
as O
the O
receptacle O
for O
the O
blanket-pieces O
, O
when O
stripped O
and O
hoisted O
from O
the O
whale O
. O
When O
the O
proper O
time O
arrives O
for O
cutting O
up O
its O
contents O
, O
this O
apart- O
ment O
is O
a O
scene O
of O
terror O
to O
all O
tyros O
, O
especially O
by O
night O
. O
On O
one O
side O
, O
lit O
by O
a O
dull O
lantern O
, O
a O
space O
has O
been O
left O
clear O
for O
the O
workmen O
. O
They O
generally O
go O
in O
pairs O
, O
—a O
pike-and-gaff-man O
and O
a O
spade-man O
. O
The O
whaling-pike O
is O
similar O
to O
a O
frigate O
's O
boarding-weapon O
of O
the O
same O
name O
. O
The O
gaff O
is O
something O
like O
a O
boat-hook O
. O
With O
his O
gaff O
, O
the O
gaffman O
hooks O
on O
to O
a O
sheet O
of O
blubber O
, O
and O
strives O
to O
hold O
it O
from O
slipping O
, O
as O
the O
ship O
pitches O
and O
lurches O
about O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
the O
spademan O
stands O
on O
the O
sheet O
itself O
, O
perpendicularly O
chop- O
ping O
it O
into O
the O
portable O
horse-pieces O
. O
The O
spade O
is O
sharp O
as O
hone O
can O
make O
it O
; O
the O
spademan O
's O
feet O
