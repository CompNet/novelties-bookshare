As O
we O
were O
walking O
down O
the O
end O
of O
the O
wharf O
towards O
the O
ship O
, O
Queequeg O
carrying O
his O
harpoon O
, O
Captain O
Peleg O
in O
his O
gruff O
voice O
loudly O
hailed O
us O
from O
his O
wigwam O
, O
saying O
he O
had O
not O
suspected O
my O
friend O
was O
a O
cannibal O
, O
and O
furthermore O
announcing O
that O
he O
let O
no O
cannibals O
on O
board O
that O
craft O
, O
unless O
they O
previously O
produced O
their O
papers O
. O
" O
What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
, O
Captain O
Peleg O
? O
" O
said O
I O
, O
now O
jumping O
on O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
and O
leaving O
my O
comrade O
standing O
on O
the O
wharf O
. O
" O
I O
mean O
, O
" O
he O
replied O
, O
" O
he O
must O
show O
his O
papers O
. O
" O
" O
Yea O
, O
" O
said O
Captain O
Bildad O
in O
his O
hollow O
voice O
, O
sticking O
his O
head O
from O
behind O
Peleg O
's O
, O
out O
of O
the O
wigwam. O
" O
He O
must O
show O
that O
he O
's O
converted O
. O
Son O
of O
darkness O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
turning O
to O
Queequeg O
, O
" O
art O
thou O
at O
present O
in O
communion O
with O
any O
christian O
church O
? O
" O
" O
Why O
, O
" O
said O
I O
, O
" O
he O
's O
a O
member O
of O
the O
First O
Congregational O
Church O
; O
" O
and O
I O
entered O
upon O
a O
long O
rigmarole O
story O
, O
touching O
the O
conversion O
of O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
concluded O
by O
saying O
that O
in O
the O
grand O
belief O
we O
all O
joined O
hands O
. O
" O
Splice O
, O
thou O
mean'st O
splice O
hands O
, O
" O
cried O
Peleg O
, O
drawing O
nearer. O
" O
Young O
man O
, O
you O
'd O
better O
ship O
for O
a O
missionary O
, O
instead O
of O
a O
fore-mast O
hand O
; O
I O
never O
heard O
a O
better O
sermon O
. O
Deacon O
Deuteronomy O
— O
why O
, O
Father O
Mapple O
himself O
could O
n't O
beat O
it O
, O
and O
he O
's O
reckoned O
something O
. O
Come O
aboard O
, O
come O
aboard O
; O
never O
mind O
about O
the O
papers O
. O
I O
say O
, O
tell O
Quohog O
there—what O
's O
that O
you O
call O
him O
? O
—tell O
Quohog O
to O
step O
along O
. O
By O
the O
great O
anchor O
, O
what O
a O
harpoon O
he O
's O
got O
there O
! O
looks O
like O
good O
stuff O
that O
; O
and O
he O
handles O
it O
about O
right O
. O
I O
say O
, O
Quohog O
, O
or O
whatever O
your O
name O
is O
, O
did O
you O
ever O
stand O
in O
the O
head O
of O
a O
whale- O
boat O
? O
did O
you O
ever O
strike O
a O
fish O
? O
" O
Without O
saying O
a O
word O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
in O
his O
wild O
sort O
of O
way O
, O
jumped O
upon O
the O
bulwarks O
, O
from O
thence O
into O
the O
bows O
of O
one O
of O
the O
whale-boats O
hanging O
to O
the O
side O
; O
and O
then O
bracing O
his O
left O
knee O
, O
and O
poising O
the O
harpoon O
, O
cried O
out O
in O
some O
such O
way O
as O
this O
: O
— O
" O
Cap'ain O
, O
you O
see O
him O
small O
drop O
tar O
on O
water O
dere O
? O
You O
see O
him O
? O
well O
, O
spose O
him O
one O
whale O
eye O
; O
well O
, O
den O
! O
" O
and O
taking O
sharp O
aim O
at O
it O
, O
he O
darted O
the O
iron O
right O
over O
old O
Bildad O
's O
broad O
brim O
, O
clean O
across O
the O
ship O
's O
decks O
, O
and O
struck O
the O
glis- O
tening O
tar O
spot O
out O
of O
sight O
. O
" O
Now O
, O
" O
said O
Queequeg O
, O
quietly O
hauling O
in O
the O
line O
, O
" O
spos-ee O
him O
whale-e O
eye O
; O
why O
, O
dad O
whale O
dead O
. O
" O
" O
Quick O
, O
Bildad O
, O
" O
said O
Peleg O
, O
his O
partner O
, O
who O
, O
aghaat O
at O
the O
close O
vicinity O
of O
the O
flying O
harpoon O
, O
had O
retreated O
towards O
the O
cabin O
gangway. O
" O
Quick O
, O
I O
say O
, O
you O
Bildad O
, O
and O
get O
the O
ship O
's O
papers O
. O
We O
must O
have O
Hedgehog O
there—I O
mean O
Quohog O
—in O
one O
of O
our O
boats O
. O
Look O
ye O
, O
Quohog O
: O
we O
'll O
give O
ye O
the O
ninetieth O
lay O
, O
and O
that O
's O
more O
than O
ever O
was O
given O
a O
harpooneer O
yet O
out O
of O
Nantucket O
. O
" O
So O
down O
we O
went O
into O
the O
cabin O
, O
and O
to O
my O
great O
joy O
Queequeg O
was O
soon O
enrolled O
among O
the O
same O
ship O
's O
company O
to O
which O
I O
myself O
belonged O
. O
When O
all O
preliminaries O
were O
over O
, O
and O
Peleg O
had O
got O
everything O
ready O
for O
signing O
, O
he O
turned O
to O
me O
and O
said O
, O
" O
I O
guess O
Quohog O
there O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
write O
, O
does O
he O
? O
I O
say O
, O
Quohog O
, O
b—t O
ye O
! O
dost O
thou O
sign O
thy O
name O
, O
or O
make O
thy O
mark O
? O
" O
But O
at O
this O
question O
, O
Queequeg O
, O
who O
had O
twice O
or O
thrice O
before O
taken O
part O
in O
similar O
ceremonies O
, O
looked O
no O
ways O
abashed O
; O
but O
taking O
the O
offered O
pen O
, O
copied O
upon O
the O
paper O
, O
in O
the O
proper O
place O
, O
an O
exact O
counterpart O
of O
a O
queer O
round O
figure O
which O
was O
tattooed O
upon O
his O
arm O
; O
so O
that O
, O
through O
Captain O
Peleg O
's O
obstinate O
mistake O
touching O
his O
appellative O
, O
it O
stood O
something O
like O
this O
: O
-- O
Quohog O
, O
his O
mark O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
Captain O
Bildad O
sat O
earnestly O
and O
steadfastly O
eyeing O
Queequeg O
, O
and O
at O
last O
rising O
solemnly O
and O
fumbling O
in O
the O
huge O
pockets O
of O
his O
broad-skirted O
drab-coat O
, O
took O
out O
a O
bundle O
of O
tracts O
, O
and O
selecting O
one O
entitled O
, O
" O
The O
Latter O
Day O
Coming O
; O
or O
No O
Time O
to O
Lose O
, O
" O
placed O
it O
in O
Queequeg O
's O
hands O
, O
and O
then O
grasping O
them O
and O
the O
book O
with O
both O
his O
, O
looked O
earnestly O
into O
his O
eyes O
, O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Son O
of O
darkness O
, O
I O
must O
do O
my O
duty O
by O
thee O
; O
I O
am O
part O
owner O
of O
this O
ship O
, O
and O
feel O
concerned O
for O
the O
souls O
of O
all O
its O
crew O
: O
if O
thou O
still O
clingest O
to O
thy O
pagan O
ways O
, O
which O
I O
sadly O
fear O
, O
I O
beseech O
thee O
, O
remain O
not O
for O
aye O
a O
Belial O
bondsman O
. O
Spurn O
the O
idol O
Bel O
, O
and O
the O
hideous O
dragon O
; O
turn O
from O
the O
wrath O
to O
come O
; O
mind O
thine O
eye O
, O
I O
say O
; O
oh O
! O
goodness O
gracious O
! O
steer O
clear O
of O
the O
fiery O
pit O
! O
" O
Something O
of O
the O
salt O
sea O
yet O
lingered O
in O
old O
Bildad O
's O
language O
, O
heterogeneously O
mixed O
with O
Scriptural O
and O
domestic O
phrases O
. O
and O
every O
sea O
breaking O
over O
us O
, O
fore O
and O
aft O
. O
Think O
of O
Death O
and O
the O
Judgment O
then O
? O
No O
! O
no O
time O
to O
think O
about O
Death O
then O
. O
Life O
was O
what O
Captain O
Ahab O
and O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
; O
and O
how O
to O
save O
all O
hands-how O
to O
rig O
jury-masts- O
how O
to O
get O
into O
the O
nearest O
port-that O
was O
what O
I O
was O
thinking O
of O
. O
" O
Bildad O
said O
no O
more O
, O
but O
buttoning O
up O
his O
coat O
, O
stalked O
on O
deck O
, O
where O
we O
followed O
him O
. O
There O
he O
stood O
, O
very O
quietly O
overlooking O
some O
sail- O
makers O
who O
were O
mending O
a O
top-sail O
in O
the O
waist O
. O
Now O
and O
then O
he O
stooped O
to O
pick O
up O
a O
patch O
, O
or O
save O
an O
end O
of O
the O
tarred O
twine O
, O
which O
otherwise O
might O
have O
been O
wasted O
. O
