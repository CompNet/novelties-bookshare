When O
gliding O
by O
the O
Bashee O
isles O
we O
emerged O
at O
last O
upon O
the O
great O
South O
Sea O
; O
were O
it O
not O
for O
other O
things O
, O
I O
could O
have O
greeted O
my O
dear O
Pacific O
with O
uncounted O
thanks O
, O
for O
now O
the O
long O
suppli- O
cation O
of O
my O
youth O
was O
answered O
; O
that O
serene O
ocean O
rolled O
eastwards O
from O
me O
, O
a O
thousand O
leagues O
of O
blue O
. O
There O
is O
, O
one O
knows O
not O
what O
sweet O
mystery O
about O
this O
sea O
, O
whose O
gentle O
awful O
stirrings O
seem O
to O
speak O
of O
some O
hidden O
soul O
beneath O
; O
like O
those O
fabled O
undulations O
of O
the O
Ephesian O
sod O
over O
the O
buried O
Evangelist O
, O
St. O
John O
. O
And O
meet O
it O
is O
, O
that O
over O
these O
sea-pastures O
, O
wide-rolling O
water O
prairies O
of O
all O
four O
continents O
, O
the O
waves O
should O
rise O
and O
fall O
, O
and O
ebb O
and O
flow O
unceasingly O
; O
for O
here O
, O
millions O
of O
mixed O
shades O
and O
shadows O
, O
drowned O
dreams O
, O
sonnambulisms O
, O
reveries—all O
that O
we O
call O
lives O
and O
souls O
, O
lie O
dreaming O
, O
dreaming O
, O
still O
; O
toss- O
ing O
like O
slumberers O
in O
their O
beds O
; O
the O
ever-rolling O
waves O
, O
but O
made O
so O
by O
their O
restlessness O
. O
To O
any O
meditative O
Magian O
rover O
, O
this O
serene O
sleep O
, O
his O
ringing O
cry O
ran O
through O
the O
vaulted O
hull O
, O

Stern O
all O

the O
White O
Whale O
spouts O
thick O
blood O
