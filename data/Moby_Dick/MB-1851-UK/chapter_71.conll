In O
the O
tumultuous O
business O
of O
cutting-in O
and O
at- O
tending O
to O
a O
whale O
, O
there O
is O
much O
running O
back- O
wards O
and O
forwards O
among O
the O
crew O
. O
Now O
hands O
are O
wanted O
here O
, O
and O
then O
again O
hands O
are O
wanted O
there O
. O
There O
is O
no O
staying O
in O
any O
one O
place O
; O
for O
at O
one O
and O
the O
same O
time O
, O
everything O
has O
to O
be O
done O
everywhere O
. O
It O
is O
much O
the O
same O
with O
him O
who O
endeavours O
the O
description O
of O
the O
scene O
. O
We O
must O
now O
retrace O
our O
way O
a O
little O
. O
It O
was O
men- O
tioned O
that O
upon O
first O
breaking O
ground O
in O
the O
whale O
's O
back O
, O
the O
blubber-hook O
was O
inserted O
into O
the O
original O
hole O
there O
cut O
by O
the O
spades O
of O
the O
mates O
. O
But O
how O
did O
so O
clumsy O
and O
weighty O
a O
mass O
as O
that O
same O
hook O
get O
fixed O
in O
that O
hole O
? O
It O
was O
inserted O
there O
by O
my O
particular O
friend O
, O
Quee- O
queg O
, O
whose O
duty O
it O
was O
, O
as O
harpooner O
, O
to O
descend O
upon O
the O
monster O
's O
back O
for O
the O
special O
purpose O
referred O
to O
. O
But O
in O
very O
many O
cases O
, O
circum- O
stances O
require O
that O
the O
harpooner O
shall O
remain O
on O
the O
whale O
till O
the O
whole O
flensing O
or O
stripping O
operation O
is O
concluded O
. O
The O
whale O
, O
be O
it O
observed O
, O
lies O
almost O
entirely O
submerged O
, O
excepting O
the O
im- O
mediate O
parts O
operated O
upon O
. O
So O
down O
there O
, O
some O
ten O
feet O
below O
the O
level O
of O
the O
deck O
, O
the O
poor O
harpooner O
flounders O
about O
, O
half O
on O
the O
whale O
and O
half O
in O
the O
water O
, O
as O
the O
vast O
mass O
revolves O
like O
a O
treadmill O
beneath O
him O
. O
On O
the O
occasion O
in O
question O
, O
Queequeg O
figured O
in O
the O
Highland O
cos- O
tume—a O
shirt O
and O
socks—in O
which O
, O
to O
my O
eyes O
at O
least O
, O
he O
appeared O
to O
uncommon O
advantage O
; O
and O
no O
one O
had O
a O
better O
chance O
to O
observe O
him O
, O
as O
will O
presently O
be O
seen O
. O
Being O
the O
savage O
's O
bowsman—that O
is O
, O
the O
person O
who O
pulled O
the O
bow-oar O
in O
his O
boat O
( O
the O
second O
one O
from O
forward O
) O
, O
it O
was O
my O
cheerful O
duty O
to O
attend O
upon O
him O
while O
taking O
that O
hard-scrabble O
scramble O
upon O
the O
dead O
whale O
's O
back O
. O
You O
have O
seen O
Italian O
organ-boys O
holding O
a O
dancing-ape O
by O
a O
long O
cord O
. O
Just O
so O
, O
from O
the O
ship O
's O
steep O
side O
, O
did O
I O
hold O
Queequeg O
down O
there O
in O
the O
sea O
, O
by O
what O
is O
technically O
called O
in O
the O
fishery O
a O
monkey- O
rope O
, O
attached O
to O
a O
strong O
strip O
of O
canvas O
belted O
round O
his O
waist O
. O
It O
was O
a O
humourously O
perilous O
business O
for O
both O
of O
us O
. O
For O
, O
before O
we O
proceed O
further O
, O
it O
must O
be O
said O
that O
the O
monkey-rope O
was O
fast O
at O
both O
ends O
; O
fast O
to O
Queequeg O
's O
broad O
canvas O
belt O
, O
and O
fast O
to O
my O
narrow O
leather O
one O
. O
So O
that O
for O
better O
or O
for O
worse O
, O
we O
two O
, O
for O
the O
time O
, O
were O
wedded O
; O
and O
should O
poor O
Queequeg O
sink O
to O
rise O
no O
more O
, O
then O
both O
usage O
and O
honour O
demanded O
, O
that O
instead O
of O
cutting O
the O
cord O
, O
it O
should O
drag O
me O
down O
in O
his O
wake O
. O
So O
, O
then O
, O
an O
elongated O
Siamese O
ligature O
united O
us O
. O
Queequeg O
was O
my O
own O
inseparable O
twin O
brother O
; O
nor O
could O
I O
any O
way O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
dangerous O
liabilities O
which O
the O
hempen O
bond O
en- O
tailed O
. O
So O
strongly O
and O
metaphysically O
did O
I O
conceive O
of O
my O
situation O
then O
, O
that O
while O
earnestly O
watch- O
ing O
his O
motions O
, O
I O
seemed O
distinctly O
to O
perceive O
that O
my O
own O
individuality O
was O
now O
merged O
in O
a O
joint-stock O
company O
of O
two O
; O
that O
my O
free O
will O
had O
received O
a O
mortal O
wound O
; O
and O
that O
another O
's O
mis- O
take O
or O
misfortune O
might O
plunge O
innocent O
me O
into O
unmerited O
disaster O
and O
death O
. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
here O
was O
a O
sort O
of O
interregnum O
in O
Providence O
; O
for O
its O
even-handed O
equity O
never O
could O
have O
san- O
tioned O
so O
gross O
an O
injustice O
. O
And O
yet O
still O
further O
pondering-while O
I O
jerked O
him O
now O
and O
then O
from O
between O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
ship O
, O
which O
would O
threaten O
to O
jam O
him—still O
further O
pondering O
, O
I O
say O
, O
I O
saw O
that O
this O
situation O
of O
mine O
was O
the O
precise O
situation O
of O
every O
mortal O
that O
breathes O
; O
only O
, O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
he O
, O
one O
way O
or O
other O
, O
has O
this O
Siamese O
connexion O
with O
a O
plurality O
of O
other O
mortals O
. O
If O
your O
banker O
breaks O
, O
you O
snap O
; O
if O
your O
apothecary O
by O
mistake O
sends O
you O
poison O
in O
your O
pills O
, O
you O
die O
. O
True O
, O
you O
may O
say O
that O
, O
by O
exceeding O
caution O
, O
you O
may O
possibly O
escape O
these O
and O
the O
multitudinous O
other O
evil O
chances O
of O
life O
. O
But O
handle O
Queequeg O
's O
monkey-rope O
heedfully O
as O
I O
would O
, O
sometimes O
he O
jerked O
it O
so O
, O
that O
I O
came O
very O
near O
sliding O
overboard O
. O
How O
could O
I O
possibly O
forget O
that O
, O
do O
what O
I O
would O
, O
I O
only O
had O
the O
management O
of O
one O
end O
of O
it O
. O
* O
I O
have O
hinted O
that O
I O
would O
often O
jerk O
poor O
Queequeg O
from O
between O
the O
whale O
and O
the O
ship O
, O
where O
he O
would O
occasionally O
fall O
, O
from O
the O
incessant O
rolling O
and O
swaying O
of O
both O
. O
But O
this O
was O
not O
the O
only O
jamming O
jeopardy O
he O
was O
exposed O
to O
. O
Unappalled O
by O
the O
massacre O
made O
upon O
them O
during O
the O
night O
, O
the O
sharks O
now O
freshly O
and O
more O
keenly O
allured O
by O
the O
before O
pent O
blood O
which O
* O
The O
monkey-rope O
is O
found O
in O
all O
whalers O
; O
but O
it O
was O
only O
in O
the O
* O
Pequod O
* O
that O
the O
monkey O
and O
his O
holder O
were O
ever O
tied O
together O
. O
This O
improvement O
upon O
the O
original O
usage O
was O
introduced O
, O
by O
no O
less O
a O
man O
than O
Stubb O
, O
in O
order O
to O
afford O
to O
the O
imperilled O
harpooner O
the O
strongest O
possible O
guarantee O
for O
the O
faithfulness O
and O
vigilance O
of O
his O
monkey-rope O
holder O
. O
began O
to O
flow O
from O
the O
carcase-the O
rabid O
crea- O
tures O
swarmed O
round O
it O
like O
bees O
in O
a O
beehive O
. O
And O
right O
in O
among O
those O
sharks O
was O
Queequeg O
; O
who O
often O
pushed O
them O
aside O
with O
his O
floundering O
feet-a O
thing O
altogether O
incredible O
, O
were O
it O
not O
that O
, O
attracted O
by O
such O
prey O
as O
a O
dead O
whale O
, O
the O
otherwise O
miscellaneousl O
carnivorous O
shark O
will O
seldom O
touch O
a O
man O
. O
Nevertheless O
, O
it O
may O
well O
be O
believed O
that O
, O
since O
they O
have O
such O
a O
ravenous O
finger O
in O
the O
pie O
, O
it O
is O
deemed O
but O
wise O
to O
look O
sharp O
to O
them O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
besides O
the O
monkey-rope O
, O
with O
which O
I O
now O
and O
then O
jerked O
the O
poor O
fellow O
from O
too O
close O
a O
vicinity O
to O
the O
maw O
of O
what O
seemed O
a O
peculiarly O
ferocious O
shark-he O
was O
provided O
with O
still O
another O
protection O
. O
Suspended O
over O
the O
side O
in O
one O
of O
the O
stages O
, O
Tashtego O
and O
Daggoo O
con- O
tinually O
flourished O
over O
his O
head O
a O
couple O
of O
keen O
whale-spades O
, O
wherewith O
they O
slaughtered O
as O
many O
sharks O
as O
they O
could O
reach O
. O
This O
procedure O
of O
theirs O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
was O
very O
disinterested O
and O
benevolent O
of O
them O
. O
They O
meant O
Queequeg O
's O
best O
happiness O
, O
I O
admit O
; O
but O
in O
their O
hasty O
zeal O
to O
befriend O
him O
, O
and O
from O
the O
circumstance O
that O
both O
he O
and O
the O
sharks O
were O
at O
times O
half O
hidden O
by O
the O
blood-muddled O
water O
, O
those O
indiscreet O
spades O
of O
theirs O
would O
come O
nearer O
amputating O
a O
leg O
than O
a O
tail O
. O
But O
poor O
Queequeg O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
straining O
and O
gasping O
there O
with O
that O
great O
iron O
hook—poor O
Queequeg O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
only O
prayed O
to O
his O
Yojo O
, O
and O
gave O
up O
his O
life O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
his O
gods O
. O
" O
Well O
, O
well O
, O
my O
dear O
comrade O
and O
twin-bro- O
ther O
, O
" O
thought O
I O
, O
as O
I O
drew O
in O
and O
then O
slacked O
off O
the O
rope O
to O
every O
swell O
of O
the O
sea— O
" O
what O
matters O
it O
, O
after O
all O
? O
Are O
you O
not O
the O
precious O
image O
of O
each O
and O
all O
of O
us O
in O
this O
whaling O
world O
? O
That O
unsounded O
ocean O
you O
gasp O
in O
, O
is O
Life O
; O
those O
sharks O
, O
your O
foes O
; O
those O
spades O
, O
your O
friends O
; O
and O
what O
between O
sharks O
and O
spades O
, O
you O
are O
in O
a O
sad O
pickle O
and O
peril O
, O
poor O
lad O
! O
" O
But O
courage O
, O
there O
is O
good O
cheer O
in O
store O
for O
you O
, O
Queequeg O
. O
For O
now O
, O
as O
with O
blue O
lips O
and O
bloodshot O
eyes O
the O
exhausted O
savage O
at O
last O
climbs O
up O
the O
chains O
, O
and O
stands O
all O
dripping O
and O
trem- O
bling O
over O
the O
side O
; O
the O
steward O
advances O
, O
and O
with O
a O
benevolent O
, O
consolatory O
glance O
hands O
him O
—what O
? O
Some O
hot O
Cognac O
? O
No O
! O
hands O
him O
, O
ye O
gods O
! O
hands O
him O
a O
cup O
of O
tepid O
ginger O
and O
water O
! O
" O
Ginger O
? O
Do O
I O
smell O
ginger O
? O
" O
suspiciously O
asked O
Stubb O
, O
coming O
near O
. O
" O
Yes O
, O
this O
must O
be O
ginger O
, O
" O
peering O
into O
the O
as O
yet O
untasted O
cup O
. O
Then O
standing O
as O
if O
incredulous O
for O
a O
while O
, O
he O
calmly O
walked O
towards O
the O
astonished O
steward O
, O
slowly O
saying O
, O
" O
Ginger O
? O
ginger O
? O
and O
will O
you O
have O
the O
goodness O
to O
tell O
me O
, O
Mr. O
Dough-Boy O
, O
where O
lies O
the O
virtue O
of O
ginger O
? O
Ginger O
! O
is O
gin- O
ger O
the O
sort O
of O
fuel O

use O
, O
Dough-Boy O
, O
to O
kindle O

fire O
in O
this O
shivering O
cannibal O

-what O

I O
say O
, O
that O
you O
offer O
this O
cup O
to O
our O
poor O
Queequeg O
here O
? O
" O
" O
There O
is O
some O
sneaking O
Temperance O
Society O
movement O
about O
this O
business O
, O
" O
he O
suddenly O
added O
, O
now O
approaching O
Starbuck O
, O
who O
had O
just O
come O
from O
forward O
. O
" O
Will O
you O
look O
at O
that O
kannakin O
, O
sir O
: O
smell O
of O
it O
, O
if O
you O
please O
. O
" O
Then O
watching O
the O
mate O
's O
countenance O
, O
he O
added O
: O
" O
The O
steward O
, O
Mr. O
Starbuck O
, O
had O
the O
face O
to O
offer O
that O
calomel O

jalap O
to O
Queequeg O
, O
there O
, O
this O
instant O
off O
the O
whale O
. O
Is O
the O
steward O
an O
apothecary O
, O
sir O
? O
and O
may O
I O
ask O
whether O
this O
is O
the O
sort O
of O
bellows O
by O
which O
he O
blows O
back O
the O
breath O
into O
a O
half-drowned O
man O
? O
" O
" O
I O

said O
Starbuck O
; O
" O
it O
is O
poor O
stuff O
enough O

" O
" O
Aye O
, O
aye O
, O
steward O

" O
cried O
Stubb O
, O
" O
we O

" O

cried O
Dough-boy O
, O
" O
it O

Mr O

Starbuck O

is O
the O
captain O

orders-grog O
for O
the O

on O
a O

" O
Enough O

" O
replied O
Starbuck O
, O
" O
only O

strike O
him O
again O
; O

" O
" O
Oh O
, O
I O
never O

something O

about O

" O
" O
Only O
this O
; O

down O
with O
him O

" O
When O
Stubb O
reappeared O
, O
he O
came O
with O
a O
dark O
flask O
in O
one O
hand O
, O
and O
a O
sort O
of O
tea-caddy O
in O
the O
other O
. O
The O
first O
contained O
strong O
spirits O
, O
and O
was O
handed O
to O
Queequeg O
; O
the O

was O
Aunt O
